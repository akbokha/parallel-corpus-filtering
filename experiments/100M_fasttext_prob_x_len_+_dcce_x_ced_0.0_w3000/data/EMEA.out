&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Sever@@ al thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods anor@@ ex@@ ia high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent chronic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to intake or the melting tray in patients where the swal@@ lowing of tablets is difficult . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , as well as ab@@ ili@@ fy , the dose of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l seems most likely to be a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for recep@@ tors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less measure than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the brain activity , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occurrence is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , which prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which suffered increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered increased un@@ rest with which Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the melting tray and the solution to intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly increased in the symptoms of increased disorder than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy , in four of the five short @-@ term studies , reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
ab@@ ili@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered additionally to an existing treatment .
ab@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of ab@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled Zu@@ cken ) , trem@@ or ( trem@@ or ) , nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , as well as with the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly spoke of man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes relate to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared with the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the ab@@ duction of ab@@ ili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ ili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes , and their man@@ ic episodes referred to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of ab@@ ili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ ion distur@@ b@@ ance in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inductance is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow distur@@ ban@@ ces ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with ab@@ ili@@ fy , consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a brain , or uncle@@ ar high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be depos@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be applied with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , there was a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events associated with ab@@ ili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ l@@ apping side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid block@@ ers , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar dose @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l as compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects , and therefore similar dose @-@ reductions should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after using the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be raised to the dose @-@ height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies at the animal , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative effect on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occur more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esie , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks for a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths . &quot;
&quot; there is no information about the effectiveness of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma connection . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I interfer@@ es with the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; in dispens@@ ing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks on healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , an D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ name . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in one Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of the respon@@ dents were in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ Rate scale , showed a significant improvement compared to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % among plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia for 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly reported about 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in some patients receiving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar re@@ mission , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ de of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , which is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the average elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l with extensive metabol@@ ites over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients no sex @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no cl@@ ue to clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different radi@@ al liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 times the mean Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were not more than 6 % of concentrations in the study , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets may take the melting tablets alternatively to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;

man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I Syndrome - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
&quot; it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I interfer@@ es with the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors , and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia for 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 In addition a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; ab@@ ili@@ fy Inj@@ ection solution is used to quickly control Agi@@ on and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by b@@ yp@@ assing adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , see the summary of the features of the drug using A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Schmel@@ z@@ tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no studies on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with Agi@@ on and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which have been caused differently from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder . &quot;
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow distur@@ ban@@ ces ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after a single dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was intr@@ amus@@ cular and the simultaneous Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid block@@ ers , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in the case of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects , and therefore similar dose @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after using the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of ab@@ ili@@ fy should be raised to the dose @-@ height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were intr@@ amus@@ cular , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections more frequently on ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following adverse events occur more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks for a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvement of Agi@@ on / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as well @-@ being and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms with regard to the nu@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe cra@@ z@@ iness , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a decreased patient count . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in one Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of the respon@@ dents found a response to study medicine were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sions@@ Rate scale , showed a significant improvement compared to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % among plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia about 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly reported about 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of studies in some patients receiving Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar re@@ mission , mainly in preventing a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % higher in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection the AU@@ C after receiving the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma ratio was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application , there was no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus , they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study , involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters previously received an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in every gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication contained in a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it may not be used in patients who still have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood prior to treatment . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that abra@@ x@@ ane in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was and that unlike other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel alone drugs should not be given with other drugs to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing , and is not shown for the treatment of standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
&quot; at sens@@ or@@ ical neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 treatment is to be interrupted until a recovery is reached at level 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for recomm@@ ending dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with circul@@ atory ren@@ al function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data for recomm@@ ending dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient data on the safety and efficacy . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ particle formulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient may not be treated again with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new abra@@ sive treatment cycles should be introduced until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ onic count has risen again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te quantity has risen again &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while clearly identified with abra@@ x@@ ane in relation to cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardiac events in the indicated patient &apos;s collective are not un@@ common , especially in patients with former anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if cases of nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in the patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and conf@@ lic@@ ting methods . &quot;
&quot; abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should be a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after the treatment no child . &quot;
male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of a sperm assessment since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the traffic and ability to serve machines .
&quot; listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia has been reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ sives and was severe in three cases ( h@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects that occurred in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established . &quot;
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active that promotes the co@@ hab@@ itation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules out of the tu@@ bul@@ inde@@ ers and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ fibr@@ in@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation results in a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ate receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation appears in the tumor area .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two one @-@ week , un@@ blind@@ ed trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study . &quot;
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks in the form of solvent @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel alone as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without em@@ bos@@ sing ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asing and 19 % due to metast@@ asing and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results of the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are presented below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to the ring on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 Acc@@ ording to intraven@@ ous approval of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration took place in a multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or long@@ distance binding of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study of patients with advanced tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ based p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; however , there are only a few data available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability has been proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and above all light protected over 8 hours .
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogenic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be maintained in dealing with abra@@ sive care .
&quot; using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de inf@@ usion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle . &quot;
&quot; after complete enc@@ ore of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good adhes@@ ion of the solid material . &quot;
&quot; then , the pier@@ cing bottle should be switched slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; if precip@@ itation or s@@ ink@@ ers are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle has to be revers@@ ed gently in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension before the application . &quot;

member states must ensure that the owner of the approval for the market will supply the medical specialist in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging supplement . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which complications could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood loss is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be checked before the treatment , to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was administered as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a primary study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from a an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , with the reference drug . &quot;
at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or were still receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study of patients suffering from a an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were maintained in the same measure as those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been demonstrated that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the launch of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiply my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is based on the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger operative interventions , which require a large blood volume reduction ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used to reduce external blood pressure in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
&quot; HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot;
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and progression can be different depending on age , gender and overall disease . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed on or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose which is required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of the an@@ a@@ emia .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reverse circulation rate increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ant &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg , three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ant increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value rose by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ant increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ vul@@ sions is required , should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the operative procedure . &quot;
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the onset of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( Day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be given at 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medication in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin on an ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ .org ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ .org ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ ian known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pro@@ s , accompanying or underlying diseases , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ den or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after monthly to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ ulation value should be determined and the usual causes of a non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence toxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.05 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone cord to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded under section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is attribut@@ able to the gift of ep@@ et@@ ines when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased for the control of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded under section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the therapy efficiency of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients that need to be trans@@ f@@ used ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia ) . &quot;
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction with the involvement of the respective patients which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the onset of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should have proper th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , particularly in underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that for patients with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output equivalent of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , ep@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received chemotherapy , if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose can be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ em@@ ias , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ tery , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ age , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , ather@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , ret@@ ard@@ al thro@@ mb@@ oses , ret@@ ard@@ an@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients under an@@ thro@@ po@@ etic treatment , as well as patients under ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; independently of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
the gene@@ tically obtained ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and related to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate part identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be demonstrated using cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ blast@@ osis ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 more hem@@ og@@ blast@@ osis ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 M@@ amm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 64 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;

survival and progression @-@ progression were investigated in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients with an@@ emia due to several more common mal@@ ign@@ omas , consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and with checks .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ous events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transmitted to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um mirrors of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experiments with approximately the 20@@ x of the daily dose recommended at humans , ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ age body weight , to delay the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uns@@ afe significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed unique for a period of a maximum of 3 days outside of the refrigerator and not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by an adhesive label , so that if necessary , the measurement of sub@@ sets is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( Day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;

&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the blood sample count , which forms back again in further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will perform peri@@ odic blood tests in order to regularly monitor the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid , should be considered and treated before the onset of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;

&quot; if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ y@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if you are facing a major orthop@@ edic surgery , Ab@@ se@@ amed should check the cause of your an@@ emia prior to treatment , and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood pigment ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood @-@ graf@@ ting after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or used / applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( medium to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will be able to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF , or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means of building the immune system , for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like the H@@ inf@@ allen ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first inf@@ usion or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days following the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis about 50 years ago , who recently suffered hip frac@@ tures ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two trials in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance ab@@ ides ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ rates in patients at A@@ cl@@ asta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; compared with all patients at A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( die of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta &apos;s manufacturer provides educational material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ cl@@ asta throughout the European Union . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and include the following key messages : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication of pregnancy and breast @-@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When access to medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the Inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ue inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended because limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age since data on safety and efficacy is missing .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ cit@@ a@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ a@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene , should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6@@ % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were comparable to the overall incidence of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug effects are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which are associated with the decrease of the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical trial in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of receiving was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were treated in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received suppl@@ em@@ ental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures following a recently developed hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local responses at the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tist area was occasionally treated , mainly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ opor@@ osis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tist area in one with A@@ cl@@ asta and with a patient treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by using oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion . &quot;
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing fluid correction .
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ ones A@@ cl@@ asta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the incidence of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of body frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density on lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ rate , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hips by 6.0 % , the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology at 152 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised analysis ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone volume in comparison to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone structure .
bone replacement mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) - the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before infection . &quot;
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
the effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ue treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total altitude and sc@@ iss@@ ors at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ aster treatment performed over 24 months compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and by 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical effectiveness in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ aster @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the once weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change in lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens A@@ cl@@ asta was studied in patients and patients with radi@@ ological confirmed , particularly mild to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
&quot; during the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were rated at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared with 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bars decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination time t ½ -@@ 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution stages ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the Total Body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the inf@@ usion period from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of the centri@@ fu@@ gal acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of substances met@@ aboli@@ zed by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabol@@ ite inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron Aci@@ d cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function until down to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid requires .
&quot; as for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally acting intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg were administered ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats , in total 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage corresponding to the 6 times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended Human exposure occurred toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a findings , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats showed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was im@@ printed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the lower ser@@ um @-@ calcium level . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the time of preparation and conditions before the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the murder of pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens which are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is structured in@@ subordin@@ ated , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta acts by re@@ norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus giving again strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ ero . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ ero with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines or used / applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ero along with food and drinks , you are worried that you have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operative treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; because A@@ cl@@ bo works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in your blood during the inf@@ usion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can last longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
before finishing the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta if you consider ending treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
&quot; side effects in connection with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent following the inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and shi@@ vers , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is uncle@@ ar if A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ asy . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects listed you are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this manual . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ a@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , corresponding at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;

A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients • suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • the over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more I
&quot; in addition , four trials were performed to over 7,@@ 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for the setting of the smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies for setting the smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and upper respiratory infections . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , provoke a small minority of patients su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is advised when using A@@ comp@@ lia with drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use with HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;

&quot; medicines used in patients suffering from health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( by providing educational packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
it additionally contributes to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I &gt; 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) that additionally have one or more risk factors like type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ id@@ emia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive symptoms or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , suicide prevention of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant must not be used unless the benefits of treatment in the individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; he also in patients who - in addition to the obesity - do not have recognizable risks , can occur depres@@ sive reactions . &quot;
relatives or other nearby individuals are advised to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately take medical advice if these symptoms occur . l@@ n
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
&quot; Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , car@@ b amaz@@ ep@@ in , car@@ ob @-@ wort , is not studied , is assumed that the simultaneous gift of potent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
patients with obesity have been studied and in addition to 38 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of adverse effects in plac@@ ebo controlled trials in patients who were treated for weight reduction and for accompanying metabolic diseases .

&quot; in a tolerance study , in which a limited number of persons were given dispos@@ als of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ id@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;

&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % caused by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z &quot;

&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of adverse effects that were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human@@ ist area , were considered possibly relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress seems to be connected with the animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects on fertility or cycl@@ amen were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure caused by Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and through lac@@ tation does not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the trials conducted to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) that cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , whereby type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was investigated in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood glucose levels were lowered by using doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos in the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins showed a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin had been studied in 289 patients , the patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , reported a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0,@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0,@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one mirror - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output of liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal area ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror increases up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ turing , ti@@ red@@ ness , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , the liver Enzy@@ matic values are to be checked . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on will be continued , should be conducted by clinical assessments until the laboratory parameters are concerned . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be reli@@ eved of fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution , a minor reduction of mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and the ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and the ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia is given in patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral dual or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indicators , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , were reported about a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medi@@ c@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative meditation . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is to be dism@@ issed ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , isolated cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; this leads to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the re@@ fraction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic substances . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents of the upper limit of the norm range also frequently appeared as plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ phon@@ yl resin . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
&quot; since the market launch it was rarely reported on heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ c@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , questionn@@ aires reported at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medi@@ c@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific kernel recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of the treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under gli@@ cl@@ aci@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel was observed in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ eic acid values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ised into groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ted , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after an or@@ ally application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination lifetime of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the entire active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( for male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( with male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium were induced .
&quot; in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ ones led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medi@@ c@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative meditation . &quot;
&quot; in another study for two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , there was a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both with effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eous synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study failed to target its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke rate above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ time risks are associated with taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and from over 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medicine showed an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative meditation . &quot;

&quot; in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as can produce no insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; acet@@ oph@@ anes resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicated that the blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human insulin . &quot;
&quot; acet@@ ate should not be used in patients , possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ one may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is found in the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ yl@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to authori@@ ze the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ans throughout the European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initi@@ ale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by an intensive insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should accordingly be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ phase , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin , insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA from insulin of animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ one in the patient , this can be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor therefore needs to take into account possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients to consult other medicines taken by them .
&quot; 4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias may lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent distur@@ ban@@ ces of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system occasionally - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy A quick recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are described as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar level can however be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .

&quot; general conditions and dis@@ comfort at the meeting place occasionally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system occasionally - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including irrit@@ ated skin r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal distur@@ ban@@ ces , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impot@@ ence / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diab@@ etics should therefore always have grape mos@@ quit@@ oes , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help person or by glu@@ c@@ ose given by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of cob@@ alt ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be identified with any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to authori@@ ze the launch of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two kinds of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 . if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id , this can be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General disorders and complaints at the date of use occasionally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already seen signs of de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ ural no@@ des ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ anium deposits , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there may still be g@@ out attacks ; therefore , it is recommended that patients at least six months of treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic will take other medicines to prevent arthritis . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant because it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were in the blood for the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily received 120 mg of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
especially in patients with cardiac complaints there may also be increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing ur@@ ic acid in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the patient &apos;s history known or currently present g@@ out and / or ven@@ ous arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney defects , efficacy and safety have not been fully studied ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ ts Since there are no experiences in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ acid @-@ induc@@ ing medicines , it can occur during the course of treatment to an acute toxic@@ ity , because of the lowering of the ser@@ um acid p@@ eg@@ els , ur@@ ic acid deposits can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han Syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the beginning of the Feb@@ ux@@ o stat@@ ure and in the course of the course ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was not conducted in@@ effective studies of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ spi@@ eg@@ els ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ chic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without having a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of dis@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which points to a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , the absorption of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x increased by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not close to side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of fo@@ etus / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or in exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator , compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol Group , was observed in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups overall more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical studies no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years long with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related to long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o stat@@ s more than once and appeared in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these cans either at all or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , depression in blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te count , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot;
effective mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro in@@ hibition located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conven@@ tionally used Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ised for analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 vs Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of the ser@@ um acid s@@ aber saw on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in week 2 during the physician &apos;s visit and permanently maintained throughout the treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients suffering from ren@@ al function The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function constra@@ int ( d . h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of the acid @-@ acid concentrations in subjects , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um acid levels on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es , so that less than 3 % of the patients needed no treatment against a tin ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the volume node size , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 in 54 % of patients . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ s / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plas@@ mac@@ on@@ isation time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to dose simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after intake single or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of ser@@ um acid concentration was observed , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 litres after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma band@@ aging of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 99.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent with the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ nia , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites were mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id was created mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ jug@@ ates ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose is found in the chair as unchanged Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ jug@@ ates ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average Total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g where@@ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g where@@ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver function Rest@@ ri@@ ction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver functional restriction did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in elderly patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of bladder tum@@ ours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ dos@@ ed group , with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ met@@ aboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered to be not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
&quot; in case of high doses , which were approximately 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity appeared , which accompanied by lowering the breeding rate and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;

&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years long with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific ser@@ um acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um acid levels on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es , so that less than 3 % of the patients needed no treatment against a tin ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients ) . &quot;

&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline , an updated R@@ MP can be submitted to risk management systems for human medicines with the next peri@@ odic safety update report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available that have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk management activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk management ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low due to the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of the symptoms is achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of enhancing the vitamin D sp@@ eg@@ els .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data which suggests that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose , which is needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive tract like abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ tuous abdom@@ en ( blo@@ t stomach ) as well as sour r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; following indications are to be followed closely , in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side @-@ effects ( see section 4.4 ) : &quot;
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after getting up the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract apart from p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given under special care ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partly they were severe and required hospit@@ alization ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore alert attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out if symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn burn the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients , who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate a es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some serious and associated with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regime contains predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , indicating whether the setting of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a deeper surgical procedure , reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before the onset of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applied during pregnancy or l@@ act@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw has been reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , however , oste@@ opor@@ osis has also been reported . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0,65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were performed in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; alpha at an oral over@@ dose can cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate and side effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract like stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis , or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is the increase of the intestinal res@@ or@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures for oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

after 15 @-@ weeks treatment the mean side level of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D was significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( Ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate The therapeutic equilibrium of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
&quot; in the Phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day amounted to 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to keep up ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption of up to intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at for women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before recording a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous dosage of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the com@@ partments . &quot;
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance did not move 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; at rats , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is affected by these transport systems . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) was given after the gift of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fast and two hours before taking a meal the middle surface under the ser@@ um concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.4 n@@ g • h / ml ( without consideration of endo@@ genous vitamin D3 ) .
the average maximum concentration in the ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time until reaching the maximum concentration of ser@@ um ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; in the liver , biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver and then metabol@@ ised in the kidney to 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion In the application of radio@@ active @-@ active vitamin D3 on healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the f@@ eces after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , however , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in animal experiments can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly higher accumulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent the transplan@@ ted organ transplan@@ ted by the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant , whereas the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( by investigating how often a renewed organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or re @-@ absorption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , further studies of 119 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant were conducted and investigated , as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the simultaneously taken medication may need to be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ sel top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
&quot; only physicians , who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients , should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or super@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or regime should only be performed under tight control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; following a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level rules ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations &quot; )
&quot; after the conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure measured as a valley mirror , compared with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the direct tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until ste@@ ady state is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative phase does not permit oral taking of drugs , the treatment of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) can be taken with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning . &quot;
&quot; further dose adjustments can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the tran@@ spl@@ ant . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to a tran@@ spl@@ ant of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended oral Initi@@ al dose recommended in kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant must begin for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients , who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initi@@ al@@ dosage of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , in an oral initi@@ al@@ dosage of 0,3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood tal@@ low in the targeted area may be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um@@ ato@@ e levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley mirror in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; the blood @-@ level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ Adap@@ tion , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentrations ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of seb@@ ac@@ al in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the level of seb@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts is usually in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in cases of 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection or other side effects , which may occur in consequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or regime should only be performed under tight control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection of adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients and tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to de@@ composition of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is provided because the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to significant fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trophy described as carcin@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid strain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of PRE@@ S like head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose contain , in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption special caution is required . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , thereby increasing or lowering blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended that the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level can be monitored in the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain consistent levels ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was used with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , it is especially cau@@ tious when making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially l@@ essen the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of studies on tran@@ spl@@ ant patients provide no indication that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and results of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often not exactly identified because of the underlying disease of the patient and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the following will list the side effects in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) . &quot;

&quot; as is known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) is often increased . &quot;
&quot; cases of BK virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
it was reported via ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding on ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plas@@ map@@ rot@@ eins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are supposed to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) that is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell inner .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ -@@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; 175 patient transplan@@ tation patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and in 630 patients after an intestinal tran@@ spl@@ ant as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung Transplan@@ tation In a interim analysis about a recently conducted , multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral test was reported over 110 patients receiving a 1 : 1 random@@ ization of either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , there was 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis of obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were killed by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.9 % versus 4@@ 5,@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis was significantly lower in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
a multic@@ entr@@ e study of oral chemotherapy was performed in 205 patients receiving pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized treatment of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or cis@@ los@@ por@@ ine ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al dose ( by protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was followed by reaching the target level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal tran@@ spl@@ ant showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods of early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of the Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ ts ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , should be responsible for the higher clearing @-@ rates observed after the tran@@ spl@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out via the bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients receiving Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approxim@@ ate 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid strain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a . &quot;

advances are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ates are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ lack , which causes blood cl@@ ots problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers it to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ates is a medicine approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ sep@@ is@@ o@@ ds with &quot; excellent &quot; resp@@ . with &quot; good &quot; was evaluated . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent side effects of Adv@@ ates ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ates may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the traff@@ icking of Adv@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , on the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute draw@@ backs are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of the treatment , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections are recommended to determine the factor VIII . &quot;
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII differ@@ ing in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to verify an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the rate of dosage should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using the modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 days of exposure is most important and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expos@@ ures and an@@ am@@ n@@ esi@@ ally known inhibit@@ ory development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who showed a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous a@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
&quot; blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day . &quot;
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 diagnosed with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; in addition , no of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) were determined by prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) an VIII In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occ@@ ured on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pro@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reported over @-@ sensitive reactions of allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ act@@ ate reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;
the activated factor VIII acts as a factor for the activation factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of factor X activated by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since the first approval , CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits of risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a sub@@ mitting of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for approval of the traff@@ ick@@ ers of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that bind and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; A@@ deno@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , thus enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene , which is not broken in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the area of under@@ mining , bone and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP examined the answers of the company to the questions he had asked , some questions still remained uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP on Day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits the patient . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently proven that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the Company does not consider CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changing the active ingredient &quot; means that the tablets are so composed , that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , by an allergy to p@@ ollen caused by nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ gel twice daily is a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main activity levels were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when looking at all the h@@ ay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who inhal@@ ed Aer@@ in@@ aze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients exhibited a relief of the symptoms at 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ aze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for treating allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ ik@@ aze may also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe a permit for the launch of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data on the efficacy and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in children under 12 years of age . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , as in long @-@ term use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , y@@ ur@@ id , g@@ hi@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ az@@ oline , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to prono@@ unce appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ gel were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to prono@@ unce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder disease or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate or an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies yiel@@ ded no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive @-@ studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to an imp@@ aired mobility or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible Latvian tre@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult micro tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual impair@@ ment , and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as a@@ trop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary d@@ rought and - dil@@ ation , red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hili@@ a as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ de , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S path@@ ogen . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 were part of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , whereas 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the weak@@ ening effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with a lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation , the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in patient sub@@ groups . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics by Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; according to the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were badly mis@@ diagnosed . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction ox@@ ic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in . &quot;
in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ st@@ ox@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dose of up to 150@@ mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms , preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ aze tablets l@@ essen symptoms associated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a of the drugs called P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine which is contained in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ unding stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to a con@@ stri@@ ction of stomach , small intest@@ ine or es@@ oph@@ agus ) , a bli@@ ster cl@@ asp , bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ ms in the patient &apos;s history ( breath due to a cr@@ amp of the lung muscles ) , a prostate size or problems with liver , kid@@ neys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or diagnosed with you under the application of aer@@ in@@ aze • Heart ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations • Cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • nau@@ sea and head@@ ache , or rein@@ forcing existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; when taking Aer@@ in@@ aze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when used in the recommended dosage , it is not expected that Aer@@ in@@ aze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or lowers the attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ aze than you should know immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ aze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of aer@@ in@@ aise if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whist@@ ling breath , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach complaints , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscular pains , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies on seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; effectiveness has been measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on day ) before and after six weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ lor@@ ine or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited clinical trials experience in the application of L@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in teenagers aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous course of disease and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms end and resum@@ ing the symptoms .
the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and Al@@ co@@ hol imp@@ aired the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which may result in injury or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us on a daily dose than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo reported fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6,@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hili@@ a as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ de , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the overall quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily rec@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; as the hi@@ stam@@ ine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all of the ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin also leads to an improvement of the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ues for a clin@@ ically relevant accumulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study involving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calories @-@ rich breakfast ) did not depend on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and experience a higher amount of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metabol@@ ised is identical to those in children who are normal metabolic .
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as with the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us reported than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 years , who were eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 m@@ g. daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was revealed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents did not detect increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies have led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced power impair@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall quality of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this constra@@ ined phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis that are fully metabol@@ ised .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient accumulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies revealed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x @-@ values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup is offered in type III lig@@ aments with pedi@@ atric poly@@ propylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the lymph@@ op@@ hil@@ ate can be taken out without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical studies at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed .
&quot; at a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ de , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall incidence of adverse events between the L@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile found in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us Schmel@@ z@@ tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ de , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with the fly . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not devi@@ ating from that of the general population . &quot;
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ z@@ tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at were the form@@ ulations of bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets have not been studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk of local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to those in children that are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; small children between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents did not detect increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can alternatively also be found in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall quality of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company res@@ umes its application for approval for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of influ@@ enza virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man because people have not yet built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is passed , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will be able to make antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the membrane shell of the virus was separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ects the human body as a body ) , puri@@ fied and used as an ingredient of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution for intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a should first be prescribed when the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood is that the virus will respond to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ a decreases the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not to heal AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and hence the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the medicine A@@ gener@@ a , which was dos@@ ed with low dose , was compared with 206 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ is may not be used in patients , the wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are degra@@ ded just like A@@ gener@@ a and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV there is in patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ a , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ rop@@ hies ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of a@@ generic in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; since only limited information was presented at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the launch of A@@ gener@@ a in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application should take place in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; generic A@@ gener@@ a must not be used simultaneously with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ zy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations which contain St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generic A@@ generic Cap@@ sules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe life re@@ perc@@ ussions with potentially fatal course .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with previously reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ a and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ o@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors of Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentrations of substance . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ a can be less effective because of the reduced plasma of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl glass content of the A@@ gener@@ a solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be set in duration 5 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , have been reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an impair@@ ment of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases associated with therapy medicines needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with this . &quot;
&quot; H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in the event of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ opor@@ osis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ zy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with pharmaceuticals , whose active substances are predominantly metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
trying to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were observed very frequently adverse effects on the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirrors of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient has already taken St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % on the other hand when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % decreases if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with diabetes in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ a are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine may possibly reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical supervision is to be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side @-@ effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ generic ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ a in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the plasma of both medicines could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ gall@@ on ) to 2.@@ 69@@ x in comparison to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions together with A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ a .
&quot; based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase because it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a degra@@ ding of the plasma of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentration and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual impair@@ ment and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days per test persons , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at plasma bars increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh systemic cor@@ tical cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ e@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect significant increases in plasma of the plasma at the same time . &quot;
&quot; since plasma samples of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time as Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , au@@ gen@@ ase may not be used along with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time A@@ gener@@ a is treated with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible rise in plasma of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the very low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust how the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose is to be adjusted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ a , enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International Standard R@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as a@@ general ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the injection into uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight in seed . &quot;
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occ@@ ured early and rarely led to the onset of treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ a or another medicine used at the same time to treat HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medicine and performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ rop@@ hies ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ ther@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ al fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din about a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ack ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
the PRO@@ F@@ AB 300@@ 6 study performed at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moder@@ ated , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ id nature , with or without it@@ ching and appeared usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontan@@ eously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ection , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice a day with low dose rate ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) to those observed under the sole A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were comparable ; an exception constituted increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and CP@@ K values , which were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive actions . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ ye@@ - poly@@ vinyl pre@@ stages with the consequence of an education un@@ ripe , not infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ med concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r met@@ ering , the mut@@ ations described in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a cervi@@ cal failure occurred within 59 , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) participated in patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically failures over 96 weeks following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M combined with a prolonged phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests . &quot;
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for ass@@ essing the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples generates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients , with which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ rel@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early termination of a failing treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits affecting the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with the lowest dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ im@@ balance of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks in a non @-@ sub@@ cut@@ aneous threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ born A@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution was used for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dose of met@@ aph@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , in case of therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
508 % increase for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore , the minimal concentration in ste@@ ady @-@ state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bon@@ ded am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , should be administered with care at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made up of the solution 14 % less bio@@ compatible than from the capsules , therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dys@@ functions should be low on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these regim@@ en schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma tiles comparable to those who are obtained on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ous nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical daily routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ a nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at age of 4 showed high mort@@ ality both in the control and with the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in a systemic plas@@ ma@@ exposition that was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous application should take place in patients with weak or mild liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentrations of active substance . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be reduced to 27 , if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with this . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
508 % increase for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % on the other hand when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical supervision is to be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ generic ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine ,
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days per test persons , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at plasma bars increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ a , enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International Standard R@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcing the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the injection into the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding @-@ time am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive actions . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ med concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children should be taken into account for the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bon@@ ded am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , should be administered with care at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at age of 4 showed high mort@@ ality both in the control and with the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in young the metabolic path@@ ways are not yet fully developed , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion has not been proven neither with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution for intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , because no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dose ri@@ de@@ fibr@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl glass content , A@@ gener@@ a is a solution for children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of 47 a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentrations of substance . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be reduced to duration if a r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with medi@@ um@@ - 49 dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with this . &quot;
&quot; H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( Type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
508 % increase for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % on the other hand when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentration and result in related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual impair@@ ment and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increased plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral presentation of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ a solution for intake may not be applied to the Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col contained in the fet@@ us due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the injection into uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 55 body weight in seed . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ a or another medicine used at the same time to treat HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r met@@ ering , the mut@@ ations described in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
early termination of a vers@@ al 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits affecting the subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , in case of therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a should be taken into account . &quot;
the seem@@ ing distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; in a systemic plas@@ ma@@ exposition that was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is six weeks to be applied five times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is applied five times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream can be applied thin@@ ly to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed . &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream but without the active ingredient ) .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo would be charged either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p by immun@@ o@@ competent adults when the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and to leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is continued until all visible f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and str@@ anded in the puri@@ fied , stu@@ ffed skin area until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
there should be a balance between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with one to circumc@@ ise leading stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous injection methods for the treatment of external fi@@ d@@ war@@ ts in the genital and peripheral area , no clinical experience has been found . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicates an increased rate of incl@@ ination reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this patient population in relation to the elimination of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , however , a lower effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair loss has not been studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if due to the symptoms of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other appropriate therapy forms should be considered in super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs there are no clinical experiences , so the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ mos@@ s on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or in the lip area within the lip @-@ rot . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after setting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient , or are very strong , treatment can be suspended for several days . &quot;
&quot; from data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 patients showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for animal studies there is no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time or multic@@ ol@@ ored top@@ ical application , quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) can be achieved , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most frequently shared and considered prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream associated with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most frequently reported and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the related side effects include dis@@ comfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the Bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common adverse effects , probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , were a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects listed in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the clinical signs , these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often results in local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) and o@@ iling ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the assessment of clinical signs , according to the test plan shows that in these trials , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scrap@@ ing and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental unique oral recording of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized according to oral or intraven@@ ous fluids . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment is superior .
&quot; at 60 % of the total 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces healed completely ; this was in 20 % of the 105 patients with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s effectiveness in five @-@ colour application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically cured and remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical exposure after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of external F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ische Ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively . &quot;
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three weeks weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated exposure time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ value after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study for der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG were significantly lowered body weight and increased mil@@ dew @-@ weight ; a study conducted for four months also yiel@@ ded no similar effects . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice , on three days per week , did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application point . &quot;
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ed , there is a risk for man due to systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , or the virus responsible for the infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have used Al@@ dar@@ a Creme or other similar preparations before you start treatment , please inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Creme only when the area to be treated after a previous medication or surgical treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have acci@@ dental contact , rin@@ se the cream by rin@@ se with water . o Use the cream not in@@ war@@ dly . o Use the treated area after applying Al@@ dar@@ a Creme not with a band@@ age or band@@ age . o If reactions occur in the treated area that will give you strong dis@@ comfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . o Check your doctor if they have no normal blood image &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleansing is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulty can be expected when with@@ drawing the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a Creme in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( uter@@ ine cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; taking other medications serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse with F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital area during intercourse , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream is to perform after sexual intercourse ( not before ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
breast@@ feeding your baby during the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Creme is not known as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od enters the breast milk .
&quot; frequency and duration of treatment are different in case of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a Cream on the clean , dry skin area with the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
men with bow@@ el war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream for 6 weeks each week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .

tell your doctor / health care professional if you do not feel comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin is too strong for treating with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue using the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and consult your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a lower number of blood cells can cause you to be more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue spot faster or you can cause ab@@ sei@@ z@@ iness .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a Creme ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , lighter skin reactions occurring within about 2 weeks after res@@ et@@ ting the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the place of application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , blast formation , skin destruction , bli@@ sters , der@@ m@@ atitis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replac@@ ements in patients with a proven diagnosis of Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ ass@@ uring equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines before the administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was examined , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by investigating its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of more than five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions at the inf@@ usion station . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , a manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , will observe the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe BV to authori@@ ze the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mamm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese hamster O@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese hamster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replac@@ ements in patients with a proven diagnosis of Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been established , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be provided in an appropriate clinical setting , in which rehabilitation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected that virtually all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction need to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because there is little experience in the recovery of treatment after a long break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of treatment , caution must be cau@@ tioned . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the onset of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) in order to minimize the potential incidence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to half the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction the inf@@ usion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data in new@@ bor@@ ns that have been exposed to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase about breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 study and their leng@@ th@@ ening with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions arose , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children of adverse drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mostly serious complications and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the onset of the treatment with a more severe form of complications during the age of 5 years ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no immun@@ oc@@ cip@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients with which it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with lacking low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG spi@@ ke in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in urine . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that could not affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug reactions , although the appearance of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for the enzyme treatment is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lymp@@ h no@@ des , most likely by man @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 @-@ 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the central phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the value expected and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 minute test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) every week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the capacity to be treated in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as seen from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increased further di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ately to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in G@@ AG mirrors was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous manifest@@ ations between the patient , which was taken into consideration by using a combined end@@ point , combining clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy analyses ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , duration of the shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
an open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the severe form of nar@@ rowing and 4 with the mean delay ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks for increased Gag@@ - Spiegel in Har@@ n during the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the moderate course form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean stroke form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe form of nar@@ rowing were only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute ga@@ it test . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be identified with any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; since there are no tolerance studies , this medicine should not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed under 6.@@ 6 . &quot;

&quot; within the given period , the holder of the authorization for the In@@ corporation has to complete the following program of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report for the benefit @-@ risk relationship . &quot;
&quot; this tab will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on natural progression of disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have been taken recently , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
information for handling - dil@@ ution and application The concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted before the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians and medical personnel ) .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , however , severe reactions arose , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occur@@ ence with more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache • Health • abdominal pain • Skin breakdown • joint pains , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • fatigue • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the inf@@ usion station &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available every year , and if necessary , the package supplement will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to store , provided the dil@@ ution performed under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • determine the number of pier@@ cing bottles to be dil@@ uted according to body weight of each patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , additionally an anti@@ em@@ etic drug should be given before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be decreased . &quot;
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration of active cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a primary study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ a and cis@@ pl@@ atin were over an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9,@@ 3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s average survival time was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies patients , in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta increased survival times compared to the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dos@@ ages is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ating micro@@ epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following prior @-@ term chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed @-@ gift , as well as the day after the treatment , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid is given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x dose . &quot;
patients must also receive intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dosage as well as after each third operation cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood image should be created before each offering , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under Con@@ sider the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment &quot;
&quot; the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ t@@ ines , a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continuing at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or over , in comparison to patients at age 65 there is an increased side effect . &quot;
&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to insufficient data on the efficacy and efficacy . &quot;
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were no dose adjustments that go beyond the dose @-@ adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or tran@@ sam@@ ea values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to the bone signature , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality has returned a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te quantity to a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutr@@ ality , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and kidney toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , was be@@ zz@@ led when pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed need to be instruc@@ ted to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic measure for reduction of treated toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid simultaneous int@@ angi@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ actic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is fores@@ een , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion in front of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated Leb@@ endi@@ m@@ pf@@ stoffe ( except yellow fever , this ino@@ cul@@ ation is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treatment guide to obtain advice regarding sperm evaluation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g per day ) lead to a reduced p@@ emet@@ ric dis@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advised if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed must be avoided . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was made to treat patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites heavy birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the block@@ age service . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed goes beyond the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .

primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in relation to the common C@@ is@@ pl@@ ine arm ( 218 patients ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring extends from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the specimen .
it is used for over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with low cal@@ orie @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take All@@ i and take no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t waste some fats in the food , thus causing around a quarter of the fats led with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 survi@@ ving patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , the All@@ i 60 mg , had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with Stu@@ h@@ lab@@ ile , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rang , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , departure o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( f@@ eces ) , Flat@@ ul@@ enz ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients suffering from c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in tran@@ spl@@ ant patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) suffer from pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to authori@@ ze the transport of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction in adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ c@@ cal , high @-@ fat diet . &quot;
All@@ i should not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ b@@ ated , in older cases and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • P@@ reg@@ n@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a high @-@ fat single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of anti@@ diab@@ etics should be adapted . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs must be adapted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ related measures , in order to prevent potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases , with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bars was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ carot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after receiving a single @-@ dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers , who at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , were observed a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the known side effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to adverse reactions in terms of possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ pas@@ cal properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect lies in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bon@@ ding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rem@@ n@@ ants of ga@@ str@@ e and pancre@@ atic li@@ pi@@ ds .
&quot; from clinical trials , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , blocking the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those students who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred within the first 6 months . &quot;
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; during waist measurement , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with plac@@ ebo 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral presentation of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , no met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adic and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of accumulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study of obes@@ e patients receiving the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ mold leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified which presented approximately 42 % of total plastic surgery . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot be identified as a particular threat to humans . &quot;

over@@ weight has influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ eb@@ ral canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; a lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
&quot; what quantity is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . as a result of the mode of action of the capsule , the adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional benefits . • You should try to remove gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously , about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not walk up stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities daily . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you exercise daily 150 k@@ cal , i.e. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a lasting weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calories and fat goals and to adhere to them . • Sinn@@ ai is a food diary containing data on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
&quot; the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a food plan and a large number of other information materials , which can help you feed cal@@ orie and gre@@ asy dup@@ lic@@ ates and give guidelines to become physically active . &quot;
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type , you can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ x@@ i is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ x@@ i can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic medicine ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , since the effects in this age group do not exist enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the agent maintains the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ x@@ i was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong resp@@ ectable trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ x@@ i , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ x@@ i , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ x@@ i ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . authorisation for the transport of Alo@@ x@@ i throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ x@@ i is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer , and for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ x@@ i for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the thickness of the col@@ on , patients with am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection should be closely monitored . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy treatment , Alo@@ x@@ i should not be used in the days after chemotherapy or for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron hem@@ med the activity of the five examined chemotherapy regim@@ ens ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;

&quot; experience for the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 mc@@ g of observed side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were associated with al@@ op@@ alo@@ x@@ i , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the meeting place ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships to be observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis trials were conducted , however , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for al@@ op@@ alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m of d@@ ox@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value of 7.4 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were received , given intraven@@ ously 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable to the effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. in single doses of 0,25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous approval follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean size of 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular carcin@@ oma occurred between day 1 and day 5 measured mean ( ± SD ) increase of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose of 0.25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) comparable to that after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after inser@@ ting 0.75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated through the kid@@ neys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in less measure , the I@@ so@@ enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous stu@@ d injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; while patients with severe liver function disorder increases the terminal elimination of the terminal and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre@@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ als in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the length of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30@@ times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , pit@@ u@@ itary ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , pit@@ u@@ itary glands , adren@@ al marks ) and skin tum@@ ors at rats but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses and since al@@ op@@ i is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is considered low for humans . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval of the drug intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is to resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are increased . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon filed data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients after 12 months of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was prescribed ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA .
&quot; furthermore , concerns have been stated that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was re@@ tar@@ ded in more patients than with the reference drug . Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test conducted in the study was not adequately vali@@ dated in the study to determine how far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( cracks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been demonstr@@ ably or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five trials of the proportion of patients whose infection was clari@@ fied after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo said the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in case of skin , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that were demonstr@@ ably or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is to be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully de@@ di@@ cts and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials for secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the impact of simultaneous treatment of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentration , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on abra@@ sive skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous dispens@@ ing of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean retin@@ opathy AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on isolated skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; retin@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ opathy is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotics . &quot;
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / stopped is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go used was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the site , which concerned about 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Che@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the ind@@ entation points of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partially P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; if due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ opathy towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of a non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was launched daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma processes were obtained . &quot;
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 with the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily communicated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with low participation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro testing to gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 of scrat@@ ched skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were observed . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the market must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as is present in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application ( version 6.2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the authorisation for the in@@ verter is required to undertake detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and the additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for tick products for human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next peri@@ odic safety update report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show , you should quit the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly ordained by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment looks on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two cans , where protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the ino@@ cul@@ ation plan can lead to an end consisting of two cans . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can resist a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin @-@ rix adult vaccine approved since 1996 , and the vaccine approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given children as part of an existing vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix caused a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , m@@ asti@@ ty ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals . a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , taking the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ hepatitis B ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepatitis B ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not yet fully assured , if immun@@ o@@ competent people who have responded to a hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , require a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ demonstr@@ able antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all vacc@@ ination vacc@@ ines , the possibility of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after receiving the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with immune system disorders , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody is achieved following the pri@@ mal @-@ di@@ mm@@ ing , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be necessary . &quot;
&quot; because an intra@@ ocular Inj@@ ection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impot@@ ence , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , ambient rix can be sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection of di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and hem@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , which was performed with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , m@@ asti@@ ty , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever compared to the frequency observed in earlier Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ri@@ val@@ ry based on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after receiving a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix were reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects , which had been ino@@ cul@@ ated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ val@@ ry was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and m@@ asti@@ ty was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study for 1 to 11 @-@ year imp@@ etus , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in combination with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ eligible hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) was reported per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of imp@@ flu@@ kes that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@
&quot; in clinical trials conducted with imp@@ etus at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the dose rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 got the standard combination vaccine with three cans . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after receiving the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the imp@@ etus received either a 2 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with a combination @-@ vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ eligible hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to that , which after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination @-@ vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ eligible hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the vacc@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ cot @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ cul@@ ation of possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in water contam@@ in@@ ating waters . &quot;
&quot; you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms which may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot fully protect against an infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those following a hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If your child has shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual dosing of the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective constitu@@ ents is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection against completion of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child is under@@ going a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ goes . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take additional medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / have received / have received or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have received / or this is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually Ambi@@ rix is not administered or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss an appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 tra@@ ded cans ) : • P@@ ain or dis@@ comfort at the inser@@ tion or red@@ ness • Mat@@ te • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • loss of appetite

&quot; other side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 im@@ pregn@@ ated doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extensive r@@ ashes that can be it@@ ching or bli@@ stering , swelling of the eye area and the face , troubled breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure loss and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like dis@@ comfort including shi@@ vers , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ants &quot; , loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts , severe head@@ aches and sti@@ ff@@ ness of neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package supplement .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without pins and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has been well @-@ known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the market , the CH@@ MP represented the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only carried out in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug are limited due to the low patient exposition . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
&quot; - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a light medication , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , r@@ ash , skin r@@ ash , uncomfortable body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with interference of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents too high ammon@@ i@@ ac levels .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was approved in &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval limited information to this drug . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ al form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , an indication of the use occurs when there is hyper@@ ammon@@ em@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ beverage cans .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium py@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium py@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and kid@@ neys occurs , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
for sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ dium neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
&quot; these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity at intraven@@ ous dosing of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
&quot; 5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , mon@@ os@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; it is important that diagnosis is early and treatment is started immediately , in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome . &quot;
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aust and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
&quot; hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen secre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zene and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month ) of diagnosed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time for many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ cial form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ in@@ ulin bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ em@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and after that were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients another wor@@ sen@@ ing of neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by an individual dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with re@@ peti@@ tive gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous dosage of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were observed .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycli@@ c dis@@ rup@@ tions or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in plasma the next morning after night fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma of the plasma were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ at was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( scan 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , who are not able to swal@@ low any tablets or give patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a g@@ astro@@ stom@@ y or nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ beverage cans .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium py@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium py@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rec@@ orders were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before birth , les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex occ@@ ured . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with l@@ act@@ ate dose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ dium neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram it is produced sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ulate form 15 minutes after the intake of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were observed .

&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.7 g and the large measuring spoon 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can not separate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products , which accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if your laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS as So@@ dium di@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of specific laboratory tests . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a higher dose , and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the primary study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine used to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was equally effective in terms of all indicators , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the launch of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at a emergency stop or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion is increased for the duration of the operation to 1.75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; before the procedure , a stu@@ d of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate subsequent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to under 225 seconds , a second release of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney disease restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second dose dose of 0,3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dosage should be checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney damage included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ ine or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ edings or increased risk of bleeding due to a mal@@ function of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ cardi@@ tis . • heavy un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacter@@ i@@ ological endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe ren@@ al damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of bleeding in arter@@ ial oc@@ clusi@@ on points occur in the case of PCI patients , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding may occur everywhere during treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine once again reaches an existing level prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ates ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants is to check the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters regularly . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of experience were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined following Ac@@ u@@ ity and Tim@@ i Meas@@ ures for severe bleeding as defined in Table 2 &apos;s foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding appeared significantly less frequently under Bi@@ val@@ ira than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an Ac@@ u@@ ity serious bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or bleeding in the point area that necess@@ it@@ ates a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding edge , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;

&quot; the attachment of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in . &quot;

&quot; if a PCI has been performed in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine should be given and inf@@ usion is increased for the duration of the operation to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the Ac@@ u@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ ine or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with the PCI .
&quot; in the Ac@@ u@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as continuous inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot process effectively .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin cannot be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin l@@ is@@ pro . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion into the area of the abdominal cavity . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with a reduction in the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effect , the brand ( Her@@ - Manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , carcin@@ ogenic , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the demand for insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A inadequate dosing or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
&quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the type of action of the insulin , and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme . &quot;
&quot; the substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ etics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yram@@ ide , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tic agents such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pine are the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in enters into human breast milk , but insulin is generally not present in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ted after oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed below are listed in clinical trials known to adverse drug effects , group@@ ed by system organ@@ classes and arranged according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
&quot; cold - sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ or , anxiety , abnormal fatigue , or weakness , confusion , concentration disorders , ligh@@ the@@ aded , excessive hunting , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to continuously switch the injection point within the injection unit , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous approval of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the duration shorter than with a normal insulin analog .
&quot; in a study with 18 male individuals at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose @-@ proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al action about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that in an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post @-@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was hei@@ gh@@ tened , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control , like in human normal insulin , is given 2 minutes before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in administration 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ anc@@ e@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
