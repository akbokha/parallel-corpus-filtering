<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. Several thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder in which the patients have manic episodes (periods anorexia high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent chronic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied to intake or the melting tray in patients where the swallowing of tablets is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, as well as abilify, the dose of abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl seems most likely to be a "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazl is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less measure than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalize the brain activity, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccurrence is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, which prevent recurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify Injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered increased unrest with which Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbs the melting tray and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly increased in the symptoms of increased disorder than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application to treat bipolar disorder Abilify, in four of the five short-term studies, reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the reoccurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered additionally to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of abbilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled Zucken), tremor (tremor), nausea (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, as well as with the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly spoke of manic episodes and in which the manic episodes relate to the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared with the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with bipolar-I-disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the abduction of abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">"abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes, and their manic episodes referred to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-ion disturbance in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductance is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorder and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are used for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazl."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with abilify, consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a brain, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be deposited."</seg>

<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, there was a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazl, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107%, while CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar dose-reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl as compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects, and therefore similar dose-reductions should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after using the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be raised to the dose-height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>

<seg id="57">"in clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies at the animal, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>

<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, yielded no medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdoses with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths."</seg>
<seg id="73">"there is no information about the effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazl; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazl has a high plasma connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">"it is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar-I interferes with the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors, and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors."</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and the serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor, as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in dispensing of Aripiprazl in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks on healthy subjects, the positron-emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11c-Racloprid, an D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and on the putname."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder Aripiprazl showed a compared to placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in week 12, Aripiprazl showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of more than 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partly reported about 2 weeks not on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in some patients receiving Aripiprazl during a stabilization period prior to randomization, Aripiprazl showed in view of the prevention of a bipolar remission, mainly in preventing a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyde of Aripiprazl, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl with extensive metabolites over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazl, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients no sex-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no clue to clinically significant differences regarding ethnic affiliation or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different radial liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical application."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects covered a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 times the mean Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="756">"Actos led to a reduction in HbA1c value, which suggests that blood glucose levels were lowered by using doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos in the existing treatment with metformin and sulphonyl resins showed a reduction of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin had been studied in 289 patients, the patients, the Actos in addition to insulin, reported a reduction in HbA1c values of 0,69% after 6 months compared to 0,14% in patients who additionally took placebo."</seg>

<seg id="865">"in the study, after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured which indicates how good the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="866">"acetophanes resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, which indicated that the blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="867">"acetate should not be used in patients, possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components."</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of Actraphone may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is found in the package supplement)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of acetylane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">"in October 2002, the European Commission granted the Novo Nordisk A / S to authorize the transport of Actraphans throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initiale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly, for example, by an intensive insulin therapy, can perceive the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should accordingly be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast-acting, biphase, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin, insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA from insulin of animal origin) may cause a change in dosage."</seg>
<seg id="875">"if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actraphone in the patient, this can be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion."</seg>
<seg id="876">"some patients, in which hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin."</seg>
<seg id="877">"when travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times."</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor therefore needs to take into account possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients to consult other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">"4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in a non-controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero."</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias may lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system occasionally - peripheral neuropathy A quick recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are described as acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement of blood sugar level can however be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="884">"general conditions and discomfort at the meeting place occasionally - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection point during insulin therapy can occur local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection site)."</seg>
<seg id="885">"diseases of the immune system occasionally - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including irritated skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disturbances, palpitations, low blood pressure and impotence / unconsciousness."</seg>
<seg id="886">"however, hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycaemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods."</seg>
<seg id="887">"diabetics should therefore always have grape mosquitoes, sweets, biscuits or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven help person or by glucose given by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect starts within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of cobalt (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">"based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot be identified with any particular hazards for humans."</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resusbed in accordance with the instruction manual for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1912">"the medicine Agenera, which was dosed with low dose, was compared with 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors, with other protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with unproven concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"in the studies with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir."</seg>

<seg id="2699">The mechanism of reapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the indentation points of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partially P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot process effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin cannot be effectively processed, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lispro."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% in human normal insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisine or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the doses of Apidra may be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines, which can affect blood glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or delta muscle or to apply subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal cavity."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with a reduction in the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the effect, the brand (Her- Manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, carcinogenic, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the demand for insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 A inadequate dosing or termination of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"the time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the type of action of the insulin, and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment scheme."</seg>

<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous approval of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin-lulisin the action occurs faster and the duration shorter than with a normal insulin analog.</seg>
