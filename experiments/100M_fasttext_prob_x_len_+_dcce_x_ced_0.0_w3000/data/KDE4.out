the module website can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Website . select the source and target language of the translation from the list @-@ up list .
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translations are very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations should not make important decisions depending on the translation . &quot;
&quot; only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated into the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert translated texts directly . &quot;
&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available . &quot;
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual too &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings extensions .... Open the card tool Tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of default setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras laun@@ cher . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available . &quot;
the Module In@@ spec@@ tor ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras overview filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M from the currently displayed website . as a default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views so as to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View is to graphi@@ cally represent ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is propor@@ tion@@ ately to its size . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , &amp; FS@@ View can be easily recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ ble display represents a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colour@@ ing and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view colour mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the sh@@ ading depth or the illustration of another file properties such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough room for representation or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle is to be used ( and thus , you can set the relative position of let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for Tre@@ em@@ aps performance algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ mp@@ ing in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always kept . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry into the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is up to the label and to prevent space losses through frame , so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are formed that are as square as possible . the best methods of this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view of the area . instead , a room pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View , used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option pictures per line has a slider and a turning field to set the number of mini images in each line in the gallery .
&quot; to view the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify if the file names are displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; to view the file size of the image , see if the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the check box image size , you determine whether the size of the pictures is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the Fol@@ der folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection , in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up with a slider or a turn panel to which level the sub @-@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; if you want to copy the original images to the gallery , you will be able to copy the original images to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the Com@@ mentary Com@@ mentary file , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth as in the original pictures for the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras of HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the Media Play@@ back for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the window navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play down , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; change browser identification adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system identification for single domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the standard browser identification of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that den@@ ies access to this browser , change browser recognition into one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the code in M@@ SI@@ E for pages , which refuse access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser identification to call the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; html ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the password of this dep@@ rec@@ ated browser .
&quot; with this option , the set browser ID is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry ... you can set up the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents in accordance with the recommendations of W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ pack . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ pack ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the shell conversion through li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management - workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use this link , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to ask you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , English is spoken , so you should be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; visit home page to get news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ pack ; learn .
&quot; the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ pack ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a collection of images on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder containing images as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; you can not exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting one point in front of the sub@@ folder name . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo out of the album and put it on the folder icon . you can find more details in the albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Sub@@ ject to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported body cameras in the Help menu support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with shell files is described in sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ pack . &quot;
modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera appears as a disk drive . the camera can also be connected via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that support a steadily increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol that was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are in general large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection has meanwhile become obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators in order to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Exif support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not see thumb@@ nails or production could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ pack ; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Manual ) is one approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ pack ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to make the modules available to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to complete , but by writing a small module to add a function than the changes to &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file selection allows you to remove the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name will only work if this ind symbol is also displayed . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; put an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ pack are stored in a single album tree , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date on which the album was created first , the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album impor@@ ting images directly to an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the destination album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to click on the album with the right mouse button and edit the album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . collection of your photos is used when you choose to add or delete collections from the tool@@ bar collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date .
&quot; the buttons el@@ dest , average , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the most recent image or that of the average section of the album . for this purpose , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ pack , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; . this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and choose the album menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview ; in addition you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be covered .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window displays the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait for a short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this in which you use the menu Tools to recre@@ ate all the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be shown below the associated preview . what information this is , you can set up about settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; set up . select the albums page here and customize the preview image to your wishes . &quot;
thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . when you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important properties including all keywords of a photo . the screen shot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; the image editing shows your photos and allows you to organize a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing images , slideshow or editing the images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... Select . in the digi@@ pack ; image editing , you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the sub@@ menu of Open with the right mouse button . to do so , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost out of the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the preview and select &quot; &quot; Rot@@ ate &quot; . &quot; in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you can keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; dig@@ ging , it will be moved into the m@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer by &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ pack ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date view in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and cat@@ alog@@ ise your photos . tags are stick@@ ers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search again . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing this , you can log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word li@@ line , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; tags are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then select New key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked a new key@@ word after clicking on an existing key@@ word , this will become the sub@@ title of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and select keywords in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select the album context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you selected the photos you wish to provide with a key@@ word , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ wor@@ m@@ quot ; pull and drop there . alternatively , you can also select with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and assign key@@ word from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can indicate a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can give a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event that it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a picture with keywords , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the Tags menu . the menu displays only the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the time beam view displays a tim@@ el@@ essly adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a select frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the frame which indicates the time unit . this displays all the corresponding pictures in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database include : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open it , you will get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; when you are happy with your selection , press OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select Edit , the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information previously entered . if you select to edit as extended search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu Search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ pack ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . all rules are line @-@ wise , added by operators . an option can be added with other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... any option can be created using the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; this allows images to compare by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to each other . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ a@@ erts , the result selection can be enlarged or smaller . if you push an image from somewhere over the icon of the un@@ used search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ pack ; find the right pictures . here too can be set a threshold .
this tab provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can zoom in or zo@@ oming it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course prec@@ eded by your images ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ Fol@@ der . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ pack ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Ligh@@ table from the context menu .
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place it there . a small arrow will show you what copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you are using m@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . the picture on the right is displayed in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal sol@@ dering actions also work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to see the visible area of the image , you have to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode Pre@@ view , both images will display the same image area . &quot;
just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zoom out . this happens in both images when you preview in the mode Pre@@ view .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos cap@@ tures , sc@@ ans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , find a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect , and use photos again . we focus on the process for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ pack ; use . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , edit , group , archive , optimize , maintain , and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management assumes , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , trans@@ forms , conf@@ lic@@ ted and exported contents which have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need no longer to find a particular photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use it for a very fast search and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; your image files need to be organized somehow on your computer . you need to decide if you want to have access to your photos , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the option metadata to be saved in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ pack ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s continue with key@@ word key@@ word , key@@ word , as you often are called by other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import kat@@ alog@@ y images from another source with embedded key@@ word , then &amp; digi@@ pack ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the correct place . the changing keywords are managed by &amp; digi@@ kam , updates while tracking the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is over . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ise your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you just want to let anyone know your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start seeing some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you this one of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Om@@ aha Beach quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming , having associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself .
&quot; you can set it for a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these inscri@@ ptions will be exported to your wishes in the inscription and / or the title of the web gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story for the publication no second time . &quot;
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it not earth a te@@ di@@ ous planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of spatial representation is already heading already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already countless and will be even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys through images with geographic information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information came about in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ pack ; as information should be stored :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the working title of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , it must be filled up as well . &quot;
&quot; if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the image to others . if the image is a stock photo , then the group / agency will provide the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this in the picture . for private persons , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ pack ; in the near future such a module is available for batch processing .
&quot; issues : plate failure , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ reservation , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread ab@@ err@@ ation &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you can find problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and considerably more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 pieces that claim a lifetime of 100 years . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and sound recording devices and store them in the right way . therefore , the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control environments . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc . &quot;
&quot; for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to cause miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . then read the data again in order to verify you . also , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store in a clean , dark dry and protected environment . &quot;
&quot; disc@@ us will keep your statistics for you . your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error @-@ mechanisms of hard drives : Dis@@ mis@@ judged &quot;
&quot; in brief : disks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in case of lower temper@@ art@@ ures , the fault rate increases dramatically . some of S@@ MAR@@ T are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot determine this error . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is just the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not account much , this can cause serious damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause loss of data loss , hardware alter@@ ation , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against po@@ inters is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember , however , that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and therefore protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since there is a surge voltage of any cable to your computer , you should make sure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also supply voltage sho@@ cks that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . this gives you the opportunity to save your data and run the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your machine is protected .
&quot; the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; you are compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your images in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with large companies included a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and B@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you open a photo one day and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer place than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at the moment , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle record errors at low level and scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . at Not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden dis@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurs , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical borders . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer distant from this border .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras follow the 10 Meg@@ apixel sensor . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum sensor size is 10 @-@ 12 megapixel . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by data loss every year . so , secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous like the re @-@ installation of your operating system , replacing plates or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses daily on an external SATA disk . if , then , one day , a flash has struck you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ iev@@ es are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , desktop reservation is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbor &apos;s house , into your office or something similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above , a common cause for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . this creates a complete snap@@ shot at two points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup is made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts simply copies the difference of files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . each further th@@ inning should happen manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; metadata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ locate images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visu@@ alization , ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able due to your nature , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
&quot; let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk : &quot;
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command whether your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; it is los@@ sl@@ ess , supports X@@ MP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ sl@@ ess compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DNG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open @-@ format format that was developed by Adobe Systems . DNG was developed based on the need for compatible camera formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata . a handful of cameras are already available for Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block@@ quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your shot , mostly in the blank format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can become problems when linking between the image file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you are using DNG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I belong to the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the cam@@ er@@ aman , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; you can use external programs for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing process . if you re @-@ edit the images again with digi@@ pack , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into Web@@ gal@@ eries only then code into MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to add your photos to &amp; digi@@ pack ; in the Ad@@ ding of a photo to an album you can add a description , as you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings to import pictures to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page properties tab and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog displays file properties and photo information , internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available . &quot;
&quot; tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif , branch notes , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ pack ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted , and we recommend checking if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected will download until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ pack until now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of the existing albums is shown , such as normal folders . the list of existing albums is shown , such as normal folders . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the destination album , press OK , and &amp; Mel@@ ody ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by using the Del@@ ete Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , you must select it first and then delete the delete selected . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to re @-@ establish photos you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully removed from the camera before you delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this above the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames when you load photos from different shooting galleries into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was made . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors the image and for file @-@ based sig@@ natures . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data about the author in the section standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , you will correct the corresponding entries from the Exif information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want another date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ o % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments , you should read the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ pack ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name to preview the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during the shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , &amp; digi@@ pack ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , it can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally off @-@ off , and in this case will save &amp; digi@@ pack ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the download button . then , select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de will appear in which you can select the files that you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ pack ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ds , which can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map a territory by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ pack ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do GPS data come into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ ones and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a map module or by transm@@ itting the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical allocation . &quot;
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and long@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script working with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ signed coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these , by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ pack ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also during a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; car title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the car field , it must be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . thus , the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only available in the digi@@ pack database ; these metadata also contains other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed without losing . &quot;
&quot; image descriptions as embedded inscri@@ ptions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images store : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the inscri@@ ptions embedded in the pictures . note : in pictures that are already inscri@@ bed , these are over@@ written by the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests on a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ pack ; supports a number of different image formats , and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ pack ; to specify , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast machines . if you have one then you can get better view results .
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the PNG compression option , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG requires a los@@ sl@@ ess algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can switch the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF photos . it has no effect on image quality , since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm is los@@ sl@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of los@@ sl@@ ed JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ sl@@ ess . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of digi@@ pack , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react when they are more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a mesh pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a solid color balance , based on a white card that was photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is the top lights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned due to the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the pointed light as a continuous white . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the pointed lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; nbsp ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to re@@ construct the option , you will get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ pack . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the particle data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w put three alternatives at your disposal : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ izer @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color @-@ sof@@ tening correction , as you are carried out during the rough conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space in the other are to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions if an image is opened in image processing / Color Management module with raw files start .
&quot; please fill in the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; default source ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color administration view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here you can only color your pictures not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correc@@ ts for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be rendered by a device . this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile with them is intended for . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension lets you recognize the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing ; many modules support , which are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of the available modules . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under the Settings menu . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adjust@@ s the time between the image transi@@ tions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . &quot;
&quot; camera characteristics are shown on the left hand side a list of all cameras currently supported . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . below you can find serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to display mode and turn it on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ pack ; for del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photos and del@@ eting an album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes due to the right side bar can be used sil@@ ently through &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ pack ; at boot , this acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; digi@@ pack ; . &quot;
&quot; the setting Bei@@ m Start to search for new photos , force &amp; digi@@ pack ; search for the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ pack ; if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ pack ; you see if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing , you will find more information about this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture , or through the context menu of the pre@@ viewing and selection of the selected viewing / editing . &quot;
&quot; the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image processing section . &quot;
&quot; displays a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file Save or the button saving from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save As . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore file or the button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing button in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last time . &quot;
&quot; virtually every image processing action can be und@@ one or restored , the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Recovery or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; using the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can zoom in the photo and zoom in in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the Check menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full@@ screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ kam ; change this . see this section for editing image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or entire sets . all image templates can be printed out of your choice . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and choose from the Album Expor@@ ting printer wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it will appear when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again to the edge .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the lab@@ s are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the rating section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is based in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a drop @-@ down box with previously mentioned keywords . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is a further simpli@@ fication when typ@@ ing key@@ word in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for fast access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding box fields in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection , if you wish to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section key@@ word filter . &quot;
&quot; the page bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - date , key@@ word and view@@ finder are used . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . ther@@ eup@@ on a dialog box that you ask if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is selected on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were moved with C@@ trl + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can specify an Advanced search through all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograp@@ hed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ controlled workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing work@@ flows . the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other photo editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should one use another color space and then have to think about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see will be presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor since s@@ RGB assumes that your monitor is calibr@@ ated to s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before you attempt a further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , compens@@ ate , autom@@ ate balance and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction attempt to automatically make the best out of your colors . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ ars the lumin@@ ous values over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing color sh@@ ading . this feature is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; same : this method adjust@@ s the brightness factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
contrast : this method improves contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ us@@ cation of all values in between . this is only visible with selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited , since over a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you can move too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ron@@ ym . you can start it using the color white balance of the image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will dynam@@ ically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ esp@@ ace again , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
preview the target photo has a red marker . the pixel of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; a hist@@ ogram is shown that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your results depends on shade , satur@@ ation , and g@@ amma . the shadow of alignment lets you improve the sh@@ ading details of your photos or di@@ mm@@ ing down . &quot;
&quot; to play an@@ stat with the controls mentioned above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it into a text file and load it later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the code depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely distributed JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this enco@@ ding also requires more disk space , computing time and is available only for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF , and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . colour mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed guide to use color profiles can consult the chapter color management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , allowing you to use it for several photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always require the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; it has four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when one replaced a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then revers@@ ed the development of the image . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the sol@@ ar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally generates a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ aper . &quot;
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an up@@ turned colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors and some photographers especially those who don &apos;t like the landscapes too much .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can rel@@ ieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
&quot; if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the results you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set up for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here . concrete the three slider below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the inside and they can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the controls and observe how the image changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated with the settings of the image , updated . on the left hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark notes , the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the three colour @-@ twe@@ et@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ just@@ ed for all shades , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the overview indicator control all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fi@@ y channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images captured using a digital camera , linear mode is the most useful . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve section to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output columns and that the corresponding pixels become dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photos is to see a red marker . if you shift this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is shown on the curve that represents the original value . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every turn that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ous curves . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image editing is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the color sh@@ ad@@ dings of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed compared to your own rider .
preview the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will keep the overall brightness even if you change the corresponding color components , since the channel mixer then is THE tool to create magnificent black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color will lead to a visible noise that comes from the space @-@ bro@@ w . far@@ brau@@ schen is made up of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their room pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the colour space first . &quot;
&quot; saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting , you can save it for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the overview indicator control all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is checked . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the modified picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scenes and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simul@@ ate moon@@ light scenes at the time of day . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rotary filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color setting correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
&quot; Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shadows . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ tic pad . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother , and with it similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sep@@ ia il@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; using the &amp; digi@@ pack ; apply tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art Portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this purpose . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or the three dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified one ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
add the tool@@ box ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the required frame type for your picture . thoroughly trans@@ forms the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surro@@ unds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture at any point . this can also be done in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
you can use a template to apply a template on a picture .
the menu image template apply in the image processing can be used to lay st@@ encils via an image .
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to have the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ pack ; mail list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be remembered for the next launch . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the templates has been set , a tree view appears which reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder updates the template of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this knob reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the picture lying under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; three different tools are available for sharp@@ ening , each of them has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but creates especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ed mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it shar@@ pen@@ ed not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digit@@ alization process must be combined with minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequent sharp@@ ening as normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal sharp@@ ening . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some sc@@ anners use a field filter already during reading the image . if you disable it , you will get the control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening tool . you can use the Cor@@ rig@@ ate Archi@@ ving menu . &quot;
&quot; you should be careful , however , as the results do not work very natural : sharp@@ ening increases sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharp@@ ening an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to make the image a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft@@ mark and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter fu@@ zzy is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or amount increase the effect . if you make the sharp mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will create close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore they should sharp@@ ening images best in their final resolution .
&quot; the sum represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a frac@@ ture from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a edge of the filter to be applied . in this way , areas with a soft switch between the tones are exemp@@ t from sharp@@ ening and hence beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focuses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter -@@ algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtration . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is using a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focuss@@ ing reaches most often better results than bl@@ ur@@ red .
&quot; the G@@ auss &apos;@@ sche F@@ itting has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ae that are far from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is actually influenced by the removed pixels in most cases . this causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures the default value 1 should give good results .
correlation : to increase the correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , you should increase this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . in most cases , you should increase this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the edge @-@ shaped sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correction on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , which leave later unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
generally bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by using bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
&quot; theore@@ tically , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Vienna filter , it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in handling small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this image has to be corrected with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of focus correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regulator Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the bl@@ ur of the compartment that was dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink allows a custom color for pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the Reiter Gl@@ ue and Advanced Settings . &quot;
&quot; detail holding p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image . a value of 0.9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharp@@ ening is required . &quot;
&quot; direction dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ dation or CCD noise will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is much noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it has to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally 1 or 2 is enough .
&quot; con@@ tra @-@ angles da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . ensure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is only low . however , it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it therefore . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and loading exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file , and later loaded again . &quot;
&quot; error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the break @-@ off button . &quot;
below you can see how image errors are corrected using Small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreg@@ round that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce hydraulic noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
&quot; a radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel is used and can disper@@ se the image . the range indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch to the front of the filter to determine brightness changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value enhances the filter &apos;s frequency response . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically m@@ apped more strongly . however , it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the phase of the phase . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges may appear smo@@ other if it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur to edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to make the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tw@@ ood and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove pal@@ ate &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequent digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tur@@ ization . the texture composition is performed with another tool , the image error correction , the algorithm for restoration has been developed by I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
below you can learn how to reduce a photo with equivalent noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ding on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read by a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that have been created by scanner lighting and phot@@ op@@ aper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially with high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the dark@@ picture button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to connect the dark image directly to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard notices the last dark image and will load it automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all previous areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : an average of the next pixel is measured . the resulting color is assigned to all defects in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ pack ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed ver@@ tices , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , in particular the medium and large photo format , can often not light the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ading ) it reduces the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with Center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ening effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a cent@@ er@@ filter with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and the color or gray scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to apply the effect of a center filter without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light strengthening at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates for an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the destination image with these options . the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the exposure image , let the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gr@@ ating in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; len@@ tic@@ ular distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distortion . coloured distortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ dient treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s to the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second grade . if you combine these two any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
&quot; in general , this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the fourth grade . this value works more strongly in the margins than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters section has the opposite sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value re@@ sc@@ aled the image size and thereby creates a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
&quot; light : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog will preview the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
&quot; the sp@@ her@@ ical or cushion correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . in case you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the false . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Rep@@ ose crop selection from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible via this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for pre@@ viewing . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview you can set two parameters set of film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option joining film gra@@ ding , if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control modi@@ fies the amount of film gran@@ ular@@ ity and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filters mix colour channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the pointed lights .
&quot; filter fil@@ ming is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ular@@ ity on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed movies , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix great silver @-@ grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ dient effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny sight specially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ dient effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better suited for large images . fl@@ atten the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing out 17 .
&quot; the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the paint came ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where colour is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ ost@@ ly landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
bl@@ ur bl@@ ur : wi@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a focal point . this simul@@ ates the infin@@ ity a zo@@ oming camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ ends the image by rotation of the pixels at a center point . this simul@@ ates the infin@@ ity of a rotating camera .
distances : bl@@ ends the picture in order to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be trac@@ ed back to the background .
&quot; bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ends the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographic camera . &quot;
&quot; sof@@ tening bl@@ ur : bl@@ ends the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
&quot; sh@@ ear@@ ing sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ends the image by acci@@ dental displacement of the pixels , thereby simul@@ ating the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera . &quot;
intelligent bl@@ ur : find the color p@@ add@@ ling in the picture and wi@@ pe them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it through filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images .
&quot; you can select an area free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps ; for example , use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start filtering the filter drops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it into the right orientation by mirrors or turning . the tools can be found in the menu &quot; &quot; Transform@@ able rotate &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Transform@@ able mirrors &quot; . &quot; &quot;
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information again , or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select the transformation size change in the menu and enter the destination values . the dialog is shown below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ pack ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is much noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it has to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading are used exactly . every single stamp for photo can be saved as text file and later loaded again .
&quot; infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it makes , but it can take a long time and drag a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently under@@ estimated operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you simply need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ pped by simply drag@@ ging it to the corners of the rect@@ angle . simply create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save under the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Acc@@ ording to aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool Acc@@ ording to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ aper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool Acc@@ ording to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data is reflected in the image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the co@@ ax help allow help to hide your images better . these aids are :
&quot; harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sels or the flower leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful .
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden middle provides smo@@ other relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; one more rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above . their ver@@ tices are the central points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can leave a static object dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the editing points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise . &quot;
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al options are mir@@ r@@ ored and ver@@ tically mir@@ r@@ ored to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it happens easily that you don &apos;t keep the camera ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ pack ; image editing and the tool free rotation . select the transforming Free Rotation and adjust the destination angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can reset the slider to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after turning a picture , you will find undes@@ ired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair this is to use the function trans@@ former trimm@@ ing out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is Autom@@ atically cut the image . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ ens the image a bit after rotation , but note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty fields created by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty fields created by the transformation into pixels . &quot;
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
corner right top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little bit dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean up this is to cut the image with trans@@ former trimm@@ ing out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to shift a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , moves the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module over trans@@ former she@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . if you press Pre@@ ferences , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single she@@ ar , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ ords generate twice as much understanding and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after she@@ ering , the image has unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is to cut the image with trans@@ former trimm@@ ing out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ pack ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ ili@@ zed . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; digi@@ pack . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; shows only files in formats that know . this is done by means of the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is displayed and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can change this list of file extensions . &quot;
&quot; virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam , supports both formats . &quot;
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient manner in this way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ sl@@ ess if it is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ pack ; support the loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ All support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of shell formats supported by &amp; digi@@ pack ; supported : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . but no film editing software , but does not have any built @-@ in options to display or edit films . &quot;

many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ pack ; your description will follow here .
&quot; edit all image editing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft@@ ness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot;
ver@@ tically divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper area shows the original and the lower the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and drop it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can zoom in or zo@@ oming it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to drag a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course prec@@ eded by your images ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot custom color and Zul@@ u used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of the installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is shown in the Pal@@ let view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the colour is described below the Pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is enabled by the cur@@ sor under the button color , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing was selected . this mode can be set by selecting the cros@@ field over@@ write below Bei@@ m Curs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created in this way as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional colour name followed by a line character , if another color is followed . if there are three figures in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find them in the color selection on the left .
&quot; graph@@ ene are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; included , are according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;

menu to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or graphs in &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
download large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than this k@@ not )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs . required in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ GUI ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list contains last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and low without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; key ) ; &quot;
the zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just been changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that it will also process later . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings co@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph file outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ GUI ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or in the command line , you will have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ viewer ; instance or to display the graph to inv@@ ent in a sub@@ window of the already existing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it afterwards with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; during the program start , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph is to be split onto several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut loading page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard disk and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program any time .
&quot; the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ viewer ; if a graph opens outside an ongoing session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window , or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time you are asked . &quot;
the site session management gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or choose to be asked during each start of the session .
&quot; the context menu , usually with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; appears , opens other possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of targeted graphs . the algorithm determines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ eh@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm regul@@ ates the no@@ des in circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is checked , the overview will be shown if this is necessary . otherwise , it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further help to this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source repository &apos;s base folder .
&amp; k@@ GUI ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for representation . it requires the following programs :
&quot; a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; co @-@ viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog box in which you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to start anew . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have a step revers@@ ing , this function is de@@ activated . &quot;
add the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; set the current symbol in gre@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors , which do not match with those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; not the symbol changes , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the dot on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current action . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
add the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbol gr@@ illes . &quot;
&quot; with buttons adding ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove will change the Tem@@ plates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; select Transpar@@ ent Pixel or Show Lin@@ e@@ ale and set Uni@@ coloured : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as clear display . you can also set the size : the Kar@@ os on Small , Medium , and Great as well as Color 1 : and Color 2 : select . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module includes tools available to read new images and save them .
&quot; this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
scanning images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the S@@ ane project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . this will have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; when you open the menu item images , a dialog , which lets you select between all available sources on your computer , select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default duc@@ er &apos;s default values in order to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure the window will be displayed completely because some settings may not be displayed .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the destination image appears . here , you can specify the compression and type of the image file . you also need to select the compression and type of the image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; you need to create or create the image . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the menu Impor@@ ting - &gt; Screen photo ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the different screen photographs :
select the complete desktop read to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if you have selected all your own program window , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read after a short delay , the currently visible workplace . if you have chosen the complete desktop read , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; once the screen@@ shot has been created , the options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send your photos to the people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world showing photos of your camera &apos;s online and show your photos safely and private to your friends and family around the world .
the module expor@@ ting to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; when you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so it is your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you click Yes button you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
&quot; if the module expor@@ ting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current per@@ missions that the module indicates . you will need to be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button Add images should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking on the O@@ k button starts the upload of the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
&quot; with the options open , friends and family li@@ ly you can adjust the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the change option to select the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , longitudinal and width rati@@ os are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
picture Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the dialog to see appears then . to enable a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same locations at the same time as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which shows coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no track data from a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching dates . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relations to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same location . since the dialog opens the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set by the displayed card . select the region in question and enlarge it . you can always select it manually , until you have reached an adequate level . the map can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to add a pile of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you will need to select these albums only . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab shows the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each picture creates a page creates a gallery in which each picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; sk@@ ill@@ show &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der album defines the settings , where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your related images . select a folder where you want to write . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . therefore , you can read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be automatically started to preview the gallery . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the C@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ sl@@ free module is a tool to change pictures without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing , since no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. at PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor has no documentation now . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then go to the Import function . this will open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image . the data will be copied after you click the OK button . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium . &quot;
&quot; you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start creating the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images you have selected are then listed under picture files in the portfolio , where you can also change the images or content of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it is integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start drinking a coffee quickly or in all the rest of the movie and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if an indication appears that codes or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings right below . &quot;
the printer wiz@@ ard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : make sense to improve you or print it directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM . &quot;
conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
&quot; first , select the RAW file to convert and start the module . the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the preview preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ sl@@ ess L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use the JPEG format , you should not select the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG format as a storage format , the metadata that are included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif data . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion button to start conversion . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the orientation orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing size in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; pre@@ press : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images will be displayed with the images you have chosen . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . the last selected image will be shown a preview of the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the list of images and place them in order to add the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the button Images , you will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can click the button OK to open the new message window of your email client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are already attached as attachment . &quot;
don &apos;t be sure to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments on the images will be put together into a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the File Images menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among los@@ sl@@ ess formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in image format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . your e @-@ mail program will automatically be started at the end . with the closing button , you can close this window automatically . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL Transi@@ tions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a graphics card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner will appear during the presentation .
the Schlei@@ fe option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a continuous loop .
the option pictures random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
&quot; in delay between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are equal to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . you should test this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly ects a different effect in each transition between the images .
&quot; during slideshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your images and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , then in individuals , places and in the group keywords entries are present . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have entered your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you click on people with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few images .
&quot; when you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same icon in front of its name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture below . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button that is located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can choose which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the image view window ( described in closer ) and select the entry category editor in the context menu . here , you can customize the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image is to be shown or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the entry search in the main window , a dialog is displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . this dialog can be viewed on the image once more . &quot;
&quot; the date can be either part of the total file , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , you will find images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like reading hand@@ books , but prefer to try some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the Quick Start , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start it for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . after that , some sample images will be loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date stat@@ s about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will be displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described , which you can create from the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before you create HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more closely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created that is to be viewed on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without any description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically explained . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have set . so , you can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time . if you want to see an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best choose a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to choose either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser is started after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them there . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in this folder , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may , of course , create your pictures with them . however , if you have spent a lot of time watching the pictures , recording places , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not happen again . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images will only be searched when you created your .@@ k@@ im file by means of HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for expor@@ ting images will be described , which you can view from the File Export menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; for the option &quot; &quot; Man@@ ually &quot; &quot; to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most of the images are compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu , select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category individuals of the impor@@ ting file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the impor@@ ting file should be imported and what categories these files are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of the file to import file using the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the image . &quot;
&quot; if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Fest@@ aying the information about your images , over ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , such as normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your images are saved and use it automatically at future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; using the menu entry &quot; &quot; Auto Photo@@ album &quot; &quot; menu entry ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will find the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left , you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which you can call by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each image . &quot;
&quot; you can see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
the list with the current category and in the right is a list of sub @-@ categories .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; share its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; because the modules of several applications are shared with each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little were tested . therefore , you should always test new modules using the demo database before you use them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules that you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so shows all the images that show you the picture preview currently . &quot;
&quot; next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules have also passed a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category individuals , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , whether you have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu bar and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to add any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all images were recorded in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them when you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is the reloc@@ ation of images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the names used are moved up to find the persons faster and assign them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected pictures and add these images with notes . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons that are located under the preview of the image on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window that the US appears as a group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub @-@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it there to categ@@ ori@@ ze it to a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking the bar , which form the top edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window from a box by drag@@ ging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are happy with the settings , click on the Options ... which allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also remove a box completely . if you want to display this window later , use the button options ... and then click Window to hide . this process is shown in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button , and try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , this is displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the removal key or select Edit selection in the Edit menu . now , the window will appear you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it offers a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images without saving you on your hard disk . of course , you have to save the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these pictures . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back again . &quot;
&quot; in the menu Images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you would like a little more privacy , you filter the images so that at the end , those you want to make for others , click on current view locks in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all images that your little sister can see , control and lock the menu item All except the current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply choose the menu entry images , which will fade out . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it , of course , that you want to look at it at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about an image _ and video viewer . this can be viewed from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in view . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all information you have on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and drop them elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see the matching entries to this page . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . &quot;
&quot; a very useful feature of the viewer by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can enter the picture in the image and zoom out . with the mouse button , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the plus button zo@@ oms in the center of the picture . shows how a Zoom rect@@ angle is highlighted and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ oms . with the equ@@ ali@@ zer sets the zoom , so that every pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key are .
&quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to mark only the picture and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad , while you watch one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with characteristics while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by clicking on the corresponding letters . in view , see a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the old is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
in order to switch the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should read and understand the documentation . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views are displayed yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected using the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed , so that you can select the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ e@@ tion , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take over these changes . if you entered invalid settings , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input error and then click App@@ ly , or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object by means of help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as a default setting , the entire texture will be rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Vis@@ i@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the Vis@@ i@@ bility level of the parent object , or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window array as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them as you like . you can also store multiple windows orders and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored on the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to assign multiple views to one another , you pull the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map table top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ or@@ age , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the little arrow to the left pointing arrow in the fas@@ cia strip . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for each type of page@@ . new views are floating , you can anchor it at any point . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with View window order ... save it . it displays a dialog where you can store the window array under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them ren@@ ame . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ ame The symbol Ren@@ ame in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view scene ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; a rendering mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on The render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or choose R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you detect the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size you can insert the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
in combination box quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; if an image is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this property are better . &quot;
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , it calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the neighboring pixels with one . the second method is adap@@ tive , recur@@ sive , because every pixel is always further divided and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ ur depth depends on the calculated values . &quot;
&quot; when you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , a grid of 4x4 will be charged additional points , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre @-@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that will be followed individually and are tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channel is to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit the object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command set by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if when impor@@ ting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; add the source code into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
&quot; copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor , you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , insert the path to your document and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in paths to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type distingu@@ ishing mark .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the bottom , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the filter smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold . you can find more detailed information on the parameters in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window instructions section , you can explain how to create and store windows orders . &quot;
the Standard Window System : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
&quot; the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement , you can create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal . &quot;
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with un@@ ts anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you will receive a card view together with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed all error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the description camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see for more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything at the camera &apos;s basic settings , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in view has control points with which you can change the camera &apos;s target point . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the button App@@ ly or press En@@ ter , change the wire model views and the object beam immediately according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( inser@@ ting End@@ liche Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button App@@ ly or En@@ ter . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also indicates the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the layer expands up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple . &quot;
&quot; you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the preview button see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you still need to insert settings for the pigment . always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , click App@@ ly on the App@@ ly button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the Color List you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to execute this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as simple as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the user button ) , so the ball would float above the ground , as you shifted the ground around one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already in the ground , give the sphere a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; first , select Sub@@ object and change the name for example in the sphere pigment . click on the Pig@@ ment button , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to set some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even when metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; hopefully , you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog can affect . thus , the scene is processed pixel for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any changes in the scene .
repeat the last un@@ finished command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit undo .
&quot; stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or over@@ write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to set default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can use this option Tool@@ rite for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre @-@ clean rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ r@@ action on the surface individually without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geometric shapes , which you can use as a building block : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using an image file as a color chart . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ d show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return button .
&quot; you can set whether each image is to be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box @-@ up &amp; ball show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ball show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if this is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ball show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ball show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . the next startup will open &amp; ball show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can set up &amp; ball @-@ show ; to set up only some of the file types , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default . &quot;
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is broken by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ball show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
magni@@ fies the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ d show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you may ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; and show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control of its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that can change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; in order to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ photo button in the menu . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you are supposed to display . exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&quot; &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images , which no longer makes scanning and storing images . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and save images that no longer works as images to scan and store images , and can store images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this site : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite , with the gu@@ inea @-@ d &#91; device name &#93; command in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel and exit .
the other settings include more det@@ ai@@ ded options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options .
&quot; in order to scan an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can zoom into the picture and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit in the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the name of the same name will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; channel ; image stores image . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite , it will automatically select with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to choose save without asking for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; Manual . the button Über starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; channel ;

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like any other programs short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . &quot;
&quot; you can set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work , thereby making your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally Amar@@ ok also has some own command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use ch@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;

&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should help each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow running external programs and commands . this is usually used for ex@@ ec ( ) . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called fairly easily . here an example in Python :
&quot; and Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure wil@@ t the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ Change signals that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions to retrieve more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; in order to add an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) to remove an item . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ex@@ its itself , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed for example , for example storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be realized with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right . &quot;
&quot; the main critic has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the t@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i Scrip@@ ts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you will also find a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
usually you have to enter the following in the Amar@@ ok base folder to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should have no trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; and Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated for comp@@ iling time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; when the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use voice @-@ bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; design : this feature is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; stack mood files at the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . when this setting is enabled , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings directory of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
&quot; save your playlist when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative Path for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the piece , the play@@ lists window opens / rol@@ li@@ ces to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
changes to context browsers automatically change the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set . by marking the proper fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray section will be activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do this , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
continue playing at the start causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the play continues automatically with the piece at the point where it was stopped at the last stop .
&quot; the On @-@ Screen Display window allows you to switch the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is shown and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes that the text is sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the opportunity to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot;
the display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available space holders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to decide on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection , and the play@@ lists automatically added will appear later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination panel driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected there is another set up in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using the calcul@@ ator : the host will enter , where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m direc@@ ts support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; enter your User@@ name and Password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send played pieces and so update the profile , this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
perform similar performers : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar performers to the played piece . note : you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs thus installed ( including the programs included therein , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions , such as the O@@ SD , assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ ad library . you can locate the file by logging in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
mostly this is because Tag@@ li@@ ad crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ ad developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when working met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then disable autom@@ . switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens when you crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then please check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are best clari@@ fied by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or by developers . use the forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one error , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the start window has been converted into the statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the review by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to rate pieces , you need to display the rating column in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column indicating . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your choice and then select From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist to the playlist and drop it there , just like you would like to do it with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the playlist will be saved . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; you may use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided in default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously deliver audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the cause of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another link ( for example , os@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is for most people the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System Control Center . enable sound servers with highest priority ( warning , see next item of FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause abnormal reproduction . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a bug , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( termin@@ ate Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . in addition the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; run before you go to bed , then you will have awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of the music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa your@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user thei@@ re username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button represents a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button after searching in the playlist the first search result is played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser you want to display . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD into the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , use files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead . &quot;

&quot; based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual evaluation has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can set the rating for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then you can select the rating of a piece as well , like all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and Edit : select rating or press F2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog . &quot;
&quot; developers do not want to show you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan , which is not assembled with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , but some users can easily find annoying . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .

audio @-@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; support .
&quot; if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; presum@@ ably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; comp@@ iles before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I receive the Error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without a P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I receive the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also needs to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module . &quot;
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output enter the device . typically is for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the x@@ ine configuration dialog enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib will take care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check on sound card m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this issue into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed main@@ tainer for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like to upgrade your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , then you will have set up this Quick Start Guide . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them by using the playlist to save them . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is contained in the folders of your collection and you have the option to import playlist , you will find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in the WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio CD protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have different ways to burn a CD .
&quot; and Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages are listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; and Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display that displays the currently running piece or current stream . just below is the range , the playing time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already ex@@ pi@@ red playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also activated . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set E@@ quali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . using playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q in the player window . once you mark the E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most widely developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation bar , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its look can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be more annoying in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window will be dropped off . the information presented there are now distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information stored in the statistical window can be viewed ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window shows information about the straight @-@ running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpreter and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you can find more information about the current piece . see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
&quot; the images can have any names , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preference . the context @-@ browser will also show cover images that were either downloaded with the Cover Administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , suggested pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the nominated pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current artist .
you can set which information in the music sub@@ window should be displayed . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the performer , lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be un@@ folded and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script runs , you can choose which to be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the changed version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the search button opens a search for google.com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing performer - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are left aside . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Performer / Album - First the pieces are sorted by performer and there will be another split after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different performers . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Jahr - Album - Sor@@ ted by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - alb@@ um@@ name is used . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by one another . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are first sorted according to genre and among them by interpreter .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing according to your taste . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . in the section to the playlist , see the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter , there is a drop @-@ down box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours to one year . furthermore , you can of course select your overall collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off . &quot;
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
download - This le@@ aks up the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces from the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
store as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the Media Player . see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details .
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - thus the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files into the bel@@ lows ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; select a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear among different performers . &quot;
&quot; the album will no longer be shown under different performers , but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes the handling of many play@@ lists quite simple . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in order to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpreter sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . if you are done , click App@@ ly . if the transfer is complete , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not correspond to your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you are using tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z , you can access music from there to the music@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachments of files can be difficult by simply dro@@ pping . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically be inserted at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries into the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed containing the letters . in order to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain whit@@ esp@@ ace , then include the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this search for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
&quot; you can specify the sequence of entries by clicking the C@@ trl key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left @-@ hand side , you will find the Add button , with which you can add the playlist to the right . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , enlarged Analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu , you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example play rolls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and set up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar , and disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on menu in the playlist . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry hides a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece to the queue , the playlist will appear in the playlist ; 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add the queue a piece , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details to set up this follow later ) . &quot;
&quot; fill in your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , adding more random pieces while playing . &quot;
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ osc@@ ale ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist is working .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes Play@@ list Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can add at least one piece of play from your collection . the featured pieces will be added at least one piece of your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated again . &quot;
&quot; the New Player button emul@@ ates the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the corresponding settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . after that , the dialog opens to edit the playlist &apos;s settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be heard twice in this playlist . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you click here more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog , you can choose from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each playlist will be added . &quot;
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and click Configuration .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts simply by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete from then on Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information to write custom scripts , please refer to writing scripts section . &quot;
&quot; the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in dialog is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply enable the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to follow the steps , you will need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will receive a worse quality when re @-@ coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until your computer has finished the burning process . &quot;

Trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recordings of the different albums can lead to the in@@ significant effect that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the file created previously will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save below is displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to save for each project file .
&quot; close the current project . if a project has been modified and still not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and alter@@ ation . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not stored , just as if you had called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called fil@@ let . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ennen , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? -@@ aid described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . it is useful for you to consider files for a multi @-@ session CD .
&quot; this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it just hides the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD which you can burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not supported , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the whole ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between typ@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; a previously created CD image burns . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the Burn button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , enco@@ ding settings and even ways to modify the size and cut off black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window will appear . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will appear in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ line is a narrow@@ er area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the button assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
open the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings ; general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on inst@@ aller . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications , also equipped with an &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled using a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and style of your task are decisive , which of the programs you provide . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features to create new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ M@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ M@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ M@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ M@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project using the project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void remo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT ad@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; it is easy to read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on hard disk ) and many enco@@ ders that are enco@@ ding these WAV files ( los@@ sl@@ ess compression ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ sl@@ ess and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or other formats like the los@@ sl@@ ess FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ ding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device circum@@ v@@ ents protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy protection . simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , afterwards the daily approach to reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk explains . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the UI , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet , or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you &apos;ll find more information about how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
&quot; the CD@@ DB sub@@ mits the CD data to the CD@@ DB file format corresponding to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the configuration directory in the configuration directory - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the standard . it must be noted that previously the enco@@ der was configured in the Settings dialog in the Setup dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ages ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; ex@@ iting ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main alignment dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . here , you need to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ sl@@ ess audio format is needed . beside FLA@@ C , there are also others such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important as both codes generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good visibility for most people and most music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ ding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; add titles to the key@@ word ( English : tag ) when enco@@ ded MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt needs to be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering into the host . it is to note that here is only talked about text : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( note from the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who has verified the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more about it in the source code ... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed first if this is not yet done .
&quot; to save the read @-@ out WAV files , the enco@@ der and so the desired file format can be selected . at first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ sl@@ ess compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab to set up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the lin@@ ux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der . more information about enco@@ ders are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg , console ) . &quot; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read out . we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords .
&quot; you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine because it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can naturally always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is composed and that you own write permission ( eg by trying to copy it into the directory ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used to comp@@ ress the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with each reading of a &amp; CD ; change when the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the device desig@@ nations for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card general settings . here , there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is shown and shown as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only In case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed if information on the creation of key@@ word ( tags ) are missing . &quot;
simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the machine must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk when you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , this is about 620 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how do the system know which data the CD should get ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls block the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want any &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply copy the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try it yourself . &quot;
CD ; throw out after reading the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must the path / folder be specified in which the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; all the way it is on the screen shot . the command is a little long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ utter@@ ed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files simultaneously : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you will never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be retri@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , search in the section questions and answers for help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will pop up a window , and you can select the database entry , which in your opinion best suits your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - enter the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for each comment ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the enco@@ der for more information .
&quot; for more information , go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or rap , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you get back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the CD editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window will not appear when you downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are highlighted in this way are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the Select All items at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what runs out .
&quot; click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for checking the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a code that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been co@@ ded successfully are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the job list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . do you have a check if you have read access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of high @-@ performance machines , the result is uncle@@ ar . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the enco@@ ding . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is . if you are reading this , you have probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package for their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs when running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
a program that calls for many different programs has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of different card boards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
&quot; Hello , still reading it ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of program start no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot keep this manual maintained . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; intended . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . and if you are reading this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real time recording from texts , he has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the process used .
&quot; if you &amp; k@@ de finish ; while playing a song , k@@ mid starts again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows drop . this works also with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the Drop off from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played after each other . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the slider . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playback speed . to reg@@ ain the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ plate LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics and others both . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used so that you don &apos;t have to manually set anything manually . however , you still have the ability to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the entries of text or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ize . these are played to the number after . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection below the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust each gun in the collection manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when applying the application , this collection will not be saved . remember when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . in turn , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening ( using file Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu selection sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be set . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to ski@@ p a song , select the Next song button , next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to turn back a song back , select the Previous piece , the post Previous piece from the menu item or press the Arrow key on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as they are saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet when originally playing a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards GM @-@ KO@@ MP@@ AT@@ IB@@ EL are ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from your hand ( with your favorite text editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all required implem@@ entations for playing a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . the general usage looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the recti@@ fier is ignored . it is assumed that the GM pattern is in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to stack on tone with number M . if your keyboard does not support a rif@@ le shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shooting . &quot;
&quot; so if you want to play a MIDI file a note with Patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term &quot; &quot; Drum @-@ Patch &quot; &quot; is meant to represent another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to depic@@ t sounds on the percussion channel . take a look at the key@@ maps provided .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply make it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this is converted using the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event , with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI Settings &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard , you can see which sounds are currently being played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a drop @-@ down list where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; this is why &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; in advance , enable setting automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ plate to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot;
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; open window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or start to play a file merely drag in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off Auto Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will be listed under Friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may have the file already . &quot;
I wrote &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anybody . I would like to point out that I &apos;m only about to be program@@ ing because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the mistake that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians in the web , which give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; can also be found on his homepage which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple UI for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as for playing DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE Website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ och@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that only appears when information is displayed . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this when &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / can be changed from the menu view and as next editing mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is shown . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you need to select the same playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation at startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during start @-@ up doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end of the animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start animation can be the ad of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ . &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ iles ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ; &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this ren@@ own in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; all needs to be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even embed the specific video clip for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file must be specified by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the Browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is in &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always taken a given back@@ end for a specific m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be played by TV Cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the device can be used to use the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ e- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port should be detected . the enco@@ ding needs to be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support for KM@@ Player only uses X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one working ) . for this reason , the video @-@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; in the course of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ nav@@ open@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
is there any hint how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested for performance every time ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be used on the package &amp; text ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the K@@ ile ; website should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling from &amp; K@@ ile , add or add extensions , this should be addressed on the K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its possibilities the manual of Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile can start working directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct pr@@ elo@@ ad : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . it is difficult to use , can also use a hold ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; here only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
&quot; document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ape &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ape &#93; , projector &#91; proj@@ ectors &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
coding : hereby the character enco@@ ding is set . it should use the character enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as default . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users do not need to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this topic will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; K@@ ile , it is quite prob@@ able that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you should notice it by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will be saved by the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment time and above . &quot;
&quot; when typ@@ ing a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; K@@ ile , automatically a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the associated line to the l@@ ul@@ sing of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) will be created ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; when viewing the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful if a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; K@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the link search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the DVI ; source code has been cli@@ cked , the appropriate location in the DVI ; viewer jumps . &quot;
&quot; master document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with others will be incorporated .@@ tex files are simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project preferences . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be up @-@ to @-@ date , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ scale selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields were designed for quick inser@@ tion of joint elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The for@@ ear@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Fur@@ ther tool@@ box is for adding items such as keywords , fox notes or references . the possibilities for possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a term for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( sel@@ ects a selection field possible ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ d is used for the definition of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the joint notes , etc . the following font sizes are available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , there are two options available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be pointed in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen or Kn@@ op@@ fs quick construction . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in the log . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed automatically . &quot;
&quot; environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the type@@ face 12 will be created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows the &quot; &quot; Giant &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Hu@@ ge &quot; &quot; in the area . &quot;
the changes are made only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ str@@ ates etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; \ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive , until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed in ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } . &quot;
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is represented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ trl E can be turned back to the editor ( for internal viewer ) . in an external viewer its window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screen TV@@ s . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar restri@@ cts the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in wa@@ vering other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre@@ diction search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this you just need to set up Modern under Settings ... Tools Building .
&quot; in order to carry out the pre@@ diction search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and close on pre@@ diction search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; spect@@ ator takes place then . &quot;
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; K@@ ile ; opened and pressed to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as a text editor ( setting ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if an error is available when using the &quot; &quot; Schnell@@ bau &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Schnell@@ bau der &amp; DVI &quot; &quot; ) , an error may be available . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file en@@ closes the source code source code . in the editor , you can use the same La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between errors . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once you click on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; if you select an empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard can be used for fast creation of a new document . further information on this can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; us@@ ages users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be opened or created a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can set up in Settings ... Settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps have to be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any and lat@@ ex ; files will be created in a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and can be carried out under the steps described above . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience its possibilities the hand@@ book to Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile can start working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate directly there directly with reading the chapter .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , and its syntax . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way clicking on \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with twi@@ sted left mouse button , the selected text will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with twi@@ sted Shift , portions of the source text can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and highlight these . for example , the lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are distinguished by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants may contain additional spr@@ ing@@ marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ Easy Edit Jum@@ ps , or the corresponding button lab@@ eller allows the jump to the next or last spr@@ ing@@ mark . thereby , this jump stamp is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; K@@ ile ; . although &amp; k@@ ate ; excellent features are added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text added ; special commands for their selection . under Edit select , the following commands are included : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
select the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also lat@@ ex ; commands with a back@@ rest ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) will be selected at the end .
&quot; to del@@ ve a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description to Edit select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to mount the environment . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted surrounding commands , you can quickly lose sight of the above @-@ mentioned environment . this command is closing the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure will not be lost . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to the Edit environment . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded cl@@ asp . &quot;
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the cur@@ ly clamp of a &amp; tex ; group # is spra@@ yed to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted group @-@ par@@ enth@@ eses I can quickly lose sight of the group . this command is closing the last group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple suits are used as guest houses . for the purpose @-@ bringing implementation is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple instructions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this automatic set of double quotes can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; it can also be used to specify specific settings ( e.g. , german or french ) , so that German or French characters may be used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when pressing Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , add &amp; K@@ ile ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a table environment , the current line is \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to assign the columns in tables , and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) each other . &amp; K@@ ile ; try to ex@@ h@@ ort this . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab , add to the column position of the current tab@@ ulator . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ates ; already offering a good source code completion , these are added in &amp; K@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three are built on demand and the other two are designed for automatic compensation . all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings ... &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment by command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the return button , the last character of the input is removed , and the complete list can be changed . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by typ@@ ing another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are made of course by selecting a command . alternatively , by selecting a command , a simple jump to these positions is possible and the desired parameters can be cli@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile , exec@@ uting settings can be made to these lists . you can select different bul@@ letin boards for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as honey@@ com@@ bs of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . on the other hand , a few letters with \ \ begin will be entered and the call for execution mode will result in a large list with surrounding commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used to provide a special mode for completing environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the actu@@ ator mode over the Men@@ Ã ¼ Do mode , the command to open the environment is automatically collected and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile recognizes that it is a list environment , it &apos;s even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile , exec@@ uting settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the expansion list for the complete command mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , for example , contains the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word is initiated in full execution mode or the key C@@ trl + Alt spac@@ ebar , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large wat@@ chers are not helpful for automatic compensation . however , it has been noted that many whales in a document are written more than once . this provides &amp; K@@ ile ; the completion for all already written wa@@ iters . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the Settings ... K@@ ile can be disabled . here , the threshold value can also be specified for the ad placement . &quot;
the complete files can be installed in sub @-@ folders ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / the Persian home folder .
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and taken into account . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as familiar as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is changed , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted using ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s create comp@@ iling , comp@@ iling and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by the standard ; 4 ; 4 ; file can be viewed using alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick construction command , a viewer is normally called after the comp@@ iling . if there is not a built @-@ in viewer , a new window will be opened each time . &quot;
a new project is about the men@@ Ã ¼ project Neues Project .... Here are the following information for the project :
&quot; when exec@@ uting the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function from &amp; K@@ ile ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be modified in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a lot of different aids to support the users . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tual ; are supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the included packages and another lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; K@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all documents and for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; K@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the operator of the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor available on all systems with installed &amp; c ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; K@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project which makes &amp; K@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; installed on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
&quot; many thanks to those who are striving for the continuation of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; current information about the contribut@@ ors there is in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help Ã ¤ ber &amp; K@@ ile . &quot;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface you can create random sig@@ natures or daily sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides the sig@@ natures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , any signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . through many sig@@ natures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily sig@@ natures , the same signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for each day , use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures , create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . thus , you get a blank ; empty signature ; in the section Sig@@ natures ; click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and paste it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click the flo@@ ppy icon . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sig@@ natures as you want . then , you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sig@@ natures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove in the File Del@@ ete or click on the symbol with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to set a short command , select an action from the list . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the right and enter the new cur@@ sed by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 is required . to attach sig@@ natures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature code from the output of a command . &quot;

&quot; when clicking a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter is placed in the main window to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools are used as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a sub@@ strate . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation , knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we still lift it one piece , we give it a graphical user interface ! no longer need to rely on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application is waiting for a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the Fol@@ ded Working Fol@@ der , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and enter the folder in the folder of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time you started .
&quot; as I said , everyone who worked on the &amp; lt ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical user interface . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then the current file is simply attached . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Check selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection is required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has an &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have been named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even a little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the gun in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; more about it can be found below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each and the GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search for the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email messages are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification .
&quot; one member may have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears bold in which they are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are performed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be marking the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that is added to the project , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see where such leaders are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
insert notes is simple . it can either be selected the note -@@ entry from the editor context menu or typ@@ ed the ann@@ otation key@@ word in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation is a role in the project . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web@@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are covered , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated after each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / lower case of tags : large / lower case of automatically added tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and end tag automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replace of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into corresponding enco@@ ding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . using the Standard Rest@@ ore button the default preferences can be recovered .
default character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or in other way than with file opening of open files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting will be engraved by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly , so that in case of a power failure or crash when the next startup of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a board runner ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the default when the user interface is returned by changing M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ched command line parameter .
the warning messages section provides the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hook @-@ up of no longer .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the structure tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree while editing and how deep when changing the structural tree is to be opened automatically . empty knots are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are such that no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means that it can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ setup abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plugins are K@@ Part applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; the following must be specified when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard there as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; enter : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path to the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; to load the component in the &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin den@@ ies loading . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely newly developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been adjusted , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts . &quot;
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
&quot; a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plugin to listen to de@@ bug claims . this action is fired by default when a project is opened which needs a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it doesn &apos;t have to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the sounds according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; displays the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to continuously send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; exec@@ utes the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without providing information to monitored variables and current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution starts when a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or includes .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script , although it is possible to er@@ ase in functions and includes . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to ski@@ p the instruction and go to the next , as if there is not the current one . &quot;
opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set to a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a K@@ Part of x@@ sl@@ db@@ g which they can find at http : / / x@@ sl@@ db@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to suit your needs and how to help you get better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; your simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folder contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag folders contain handy , symbolic suff@@ i@@ xes of picture buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Properties dialog , den &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without the risk of a typ@@ ist . &quot;
tag @-@ Fol@@ der are nothing but a folder . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag @-@ Fol@@ der carry the name of the description language and version . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better view and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains , as a single element type , nothing else . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used is called &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has an ordinary attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; this element can only be used once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
prints the source code used for filling in the tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; plain &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ dy ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg breaking , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; Over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for it , at@@ tain@@ able via DT@@ D or DT@@ D settings . to edit a &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as a nickname .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . clicking on New action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; using this action assigned button short@@ cut . by clicking the Custom button , button short@@ cut can be assigned , with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut is removable . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . &quot;
the first must be the name of the script and the interpreter . example : sh / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we sub@@ stituted with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above listed methods , a script can take input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the default input . in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable normally only makes sense with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output . it can be specified what should happen to the output written to the standard output , by setting the value the selection box output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the day to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use its use , enable dialog &quot; Edit day &quot; if available so that entering the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; Menu ; , Graphics Other Programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; and ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , is called , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered to be loose , fixed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; starting ; -@@ tag will be inserted in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , as there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar set dialogue about settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element which should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick access to the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by placing all the symbols in order to ensure that everything works .
&quot; backup into the correct folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be im@@ par@@ ted to the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please fit your &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create an &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might be in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first part we &apos;ll let you handle the second one here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Path , relative to this file , for the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these docum@@ entations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ ht@@ m@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in PHP ; documentation such a thing : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Tagged Start@@ ed = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html &quot;
notice the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources will be replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used for designing the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your do@@ cr@@ c file easily and convert to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are certain that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an email menu entry like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions will be checked and only available if our team needs them as accurate and useless for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ pg keys ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; upload can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems it is warning and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Conver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folders .
Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ Line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . to understand this and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze them with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; use , available . tool bars on actions are all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then can be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; samples to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which allows the shared use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building man@@ ners , the card holders with information and the tool@@ bar . please propose in , and for more detailed information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the map@@ le runner with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , like closing the current , other or all board riders , re@@ charging , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the Tags under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string under the mouse cur@@ sor refers to a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert them into their document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . if they want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the display with card holders are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click . actions such as Add , Rem@@ ove , Up@@ load or Del@@ ete the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of breakdown in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available for a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , the internal structure of the active document is displayed . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element it opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces change . the entry system that is aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of Web @-@ technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and edited project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two card@@ boards at the bottom end of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this map shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this map shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed will give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . display them on a symbol and they will be displayed with the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H is in front of her bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while striving to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a close idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us would be an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this , be the suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim has to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follow , in good application of free software , the idea of Why do you develop , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars automation is possible almost every task . by program Kom@@ mander , you can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; without having to remember any scrip@@ ting language syntax . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development , and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta . the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more detailed documentation , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick @-@ access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code pieces and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; html ; -@@ friction , so that they are displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as a format@@ ting reference . &quot;
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ sp@@ elling that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switch block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go straight to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages out !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
on @-@ off of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ column to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; search through the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy graphic files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
download the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details . &quot;
&quot; load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars , and are available only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project . &quot;
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or Project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be saved by settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are saved using tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you &apos;ll be asked when you exit whether you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
&quot; enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that has made you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities out of the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be removed from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the loading fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded into the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the inser@@ tion by tool bar is denied if this day is contra@@ dict the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the above listed menu items . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in disabled . &quot;
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available survey schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by means of external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries it can sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . with selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog include any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser . &quot;
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which you can add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed free , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be changed later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can see the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ .com ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . with server @-@ like scrip@@ ts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated . if a project is started anew , not anch@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection for good th@@ inners . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the window profile or Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which will be re @-@ read for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed will be supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the options button . in this , troubleshooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the profiles , upload profiles can be uploaded ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile for each profile , by displaying a unique tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration dialog , you can disable event actions and add or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . &quot;
&quot; to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , however , the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu accessible with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the core memory and forget it for programmers . this possibility is useful , if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password will be stored on the disk so that it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in a project , that is , by simply num@@ bing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar in the Project or Project tool@@ bar . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working .
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best designed using tool@@ bars . use and addition distinguish themselves . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bars and symbols can be configured either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , can be ren@@ aming tool bars , ren@@ aming tool bars or tool@@ bars , which can be shown in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and the action lab@@ elled , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions . set .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you can imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to Anim@@ ated ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a template saving as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this happens , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As a template saving selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file to a single layer folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in project files and select Site template , enter and backup a name for the template , but of course it can be stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ set head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except the master folders in the template directory . if a root folder is set to this , it would not be explicitly enabled in this path . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text component . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
&quot; allows prec@@ arious or recre@@ ated text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , enabling a whole presentation to be equipped with the matching he@@ aders / foot@@ ers for a whole presentation by copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; sourc@@ ec@@ ode @-@ editor which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second partition divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back if necessary to the source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ PL file of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . to edit , it is still necessary to change the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes both in the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously runs . pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is active , this mode is active , pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and the source code editor can be set adjustable through Settings Qu@@ anta .... Acc@@ ording to V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small chip for fast computers and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , tools document properties to be selected . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual enco@@ ding . this allows you to modify the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the contents -@@ column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to create the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button , selecting the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; using the cur@@ sor is possible as in a text processing , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves independently . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using back @-@ key or remote key . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it is to be observed that the inser@@ tion of tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other anchor day . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars , such as the wiz@@ ard wiz@@ ard or the lists assistant , are de@@ activated . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars will have to be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool to examine style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could be differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , many other useful functions have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; even 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check codes , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal and the other is different in one line , then the color shows which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der Fol@@ der Sp@@ read Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Target Fol@@ der
&quot; open dialog enables manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop down list . &quot;
&quot; the folder folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to immediately define an output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two corresponding files , they in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load them and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you cannot remove anything from &amp; # diff@@ 3 ; just drop the drop of text into a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the Info Line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed through the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , you see the color which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is shown on re@@ frac@@ tory lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription : , the file name and &#91; Shift &#93; when you edit the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging already text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparative windows are used , each difference at the same time is also a conflict which has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also emphasize a jump in the position in the windows where the group &apos;s first row is otherwise not visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and on the left a black bar appears . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in any mark you might copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; Con@@ centr@@ ation Con@@ trac@@ ts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options or ignore Ign@@ ati@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page from , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the inser@@ tion button you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Image A@@ way / C@@ trl @-@ Image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Image A@@ way / C@@ trl @-@ Image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker into the clip@@ board , press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . if this is enabled , the option will automatically copy to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option because you might acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors do not use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line end of the source files not included , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically when saving and restored to the next startup . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences in recur@@ sive script are displayed . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ anned . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically create an un@@ regulated colour . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press enter or return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car @-@ drive sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line drive &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line drive &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the auto @-@ return sign will be made visible , however , like a white sign . during the merge , this option must be disabled . in default this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic transmission mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will appear before the next un@@ resolved conflict will proceed . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore Ign@@ ati@@ os C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are covered in the chapter for scanning folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see for details , see documentation on directory comparison and mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ orig@@ an . if there is already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig@@ an , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not apply to the currently running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; over the selection fields for enco@@ ding , a short reference appears , which is the local enco@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different enco@@ ding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the enco@@ ding of output commands . &quot;
&quot; ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore Ign@@ ati@@ os C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded overview column . however , you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you &apos;d rather want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply click the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and use the file name of the last source file as default names for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; # diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor which matches exactly your needs . you can use this function for example to cut annoying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first handed over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only with line comparison . you can write your own pre@@ processor which matches exactly your needs . each line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert line dig@@ its for line letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary expression that fits on each string and therefore covers all characters in one line . the \ \ U converts the text found in upper@@ case letters .
&quot; CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command is needed for line ab@@ norm@@ s.@@ You can change the list as required . &quot;
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you might even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ norm@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ very sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and any hit will be replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
&quot; instead of used , you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details differently . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for display and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the line @-@ down algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line comparison pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders . &quot;
... make a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting
... can simul@@ ate the mer@@ ging and display the simulated changes without really performing it ;
&quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merge individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will find a small message window on current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed that were compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when the folder is finished , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side ... &quot;
each file and folder that was found while scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is normally folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / or clicking on the object , or by pressing the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later , when it is old , red becomes . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. A a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge can not be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merge can not be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that the two folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B by A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and the option new file instead of merge ( unsure ) is enabled , then an error message appears : files are different , but the same date appears , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during mer@@ ging a file is processed after the other . you state @-@ column shows skill when the merge is successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurs . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Complete analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you haven &apos;t specified a destination folder , C will be used as a target in the three @-@ folder merge mode , B is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : choose directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if due to conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . they can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with options through , simul@@ ating and inter@@ rup@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; choose Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen , without really making changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window opens ( see the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are ready with a file , you can start / continue the directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to resolve the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to try another action for the entry or to resolve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually merged , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not be merged again . even if this merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged again . only if you change the merge action , these entries are merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit the given pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . a number of patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig@@ ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than one sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig@@ ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be configured specifically with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point is selected . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree or not . this option is enabled by default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is disabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a continuous loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes down . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ sample ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that both folders are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the copy of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is assumed that the other file was not changed . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another folder , the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ original If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only mer@@ ging entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder mer@@ ging view is visible while mer@@ ging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the option folder &amp; text window to switch to main window in the window menu and switch between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be set up and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this for reading files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder . then , a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permission or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change date from the original will devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . first , K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start the Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3D from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; suppose that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch starts to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders will not be supported in part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diffusion 2 are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GPL softwares for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who went this way or wanted to go .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably doesn &apos;t have the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more detailed information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this line is often the case . &quot;
this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
&quot; you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or higher . &quot;
information on how to use CR@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the &amp; # diff@@ 3 base folder ; distribution : &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure check out more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marker .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries will show that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the target folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be switched off in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or move them . this works in both desktop and multiple . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other applications .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other work areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager set up and exit . if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , there will also be the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are shown in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is shown together with name , the names will be provided with ordin@@ al numbers , eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the &quot; &quot; k@@ p@@ ager &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces will be shown to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; appear in a 2x@@ n grid , as well as from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs out of the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch settings ... allow dialog settings to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have any writing for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ not . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; if you like &amp; k@@ not ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen shows the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter on the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ not ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the window display mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
if you additionally press &amp; Shift ; press the button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop window is fixed and only the lower right corner is moved . &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy it into a file to insert it into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will appear . the selected area will appear in a window .
&quot; &amp; gt ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button again loading in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , en@@ larger and smaller &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; you can use an area of the screen , so you would use a magni@@ fier to view the printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual handic@@ apped . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor pers@@ ist for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and those of any mouse click causes pain . &quot;
&quot; it is intended to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and allow each mouse @-@ click pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even more clear : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoiding pain that will arise when clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as in all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement .
&quot; move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling in pressed mouse button . this smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this time of reference must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent Tr@@ acking is enabled , the shooting range is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after clicking the mouse button wa@@ its before it takes place the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; this function will be stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound appears , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , is called &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the button on the application , the settings will be reset to the last pressing of the application . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later slide the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should consciously make the right click without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not show a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse is bu@@ zz@@ ing , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily scr@@ ape down with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if an im@@ position is just started . if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can end by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . by doing so , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and then sets the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . however , use mouse clicks on a neutral area of desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bars and menus , and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with intelligent routing , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy text , paste it into the clip@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , press the Shift key at the end of the text area and press the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . thus , each time &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is played ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the sliding shift begins . later , you can also use the smart move without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . however , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button shortly after the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor stops . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome , and those of the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time to start a pulling process before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( enter either this &amp; URL ; in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or restart k@@ help@@ center help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets the dum@@ b users speak their computers for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course pro@@ positions that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text passages . from the text passages , you can often choose used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you define the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ tran@@ script . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the language selected to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be recorded in words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
&quot; if you have done k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the memory . you can select from it phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu item settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ tran@@ script and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the flash@@ card language output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down field below the input field , specify the character enco@@ ding to be passed on to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box , if the text is unchanged as default input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications will be a standardized interface for voice output and that is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text@@ book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant words , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the storage box . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector of the editing window for text passages , you can choose whether the text passages should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; the book is saved with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ tran@@ script page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for wor@@ ding . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ tran@@ scription . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language required for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply as@@ cer@@ tained by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . as &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you generate a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for processing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the short@@ cut short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the delay memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is ordered by default over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip at the bottom of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , an exp@@ and@@ able bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is ordered by default over the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably have not entered the command for voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the flash@@ card voice output . ( see settings dialog for speech synthes@@ izer for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s @-@ system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently it only supports the English pr@@ on@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to further distribute it without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ etts folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be switched on as standard input .
&quot; the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , all &amp; k@@ de ; applications provide a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator takes place only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot talk to print text through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored which allows the user to spend time and time again . &quot;
&quot; note that &amp; k@@ mouth , not a speech synthes@@ izer . on the computer , a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of modules of existing service , which allows each application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers are ready , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities . &quot;
&quot; reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot;
&quot; the speech output is done via the speech speech program , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) over the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Help program .

&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . subscribe to the list of https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de accessibility . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install speech program speech and set it correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card will be displayed in General . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up several variations for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
several speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer drivers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the map@@ le runner spokes@@ person in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the flash@@ card speaker is shown . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already furnished speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to move the speaker to the list below . the order of the spokes@@ persons in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girls voice . &quot;
&quot; to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the card general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is ti@@ cked to allow the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card order to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can run the &amp; k@@ de language dispens@@ ing system ; click on the General Card in General to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card ticket orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and run the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the read is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series you can start , cancel , stop and record text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be shown if K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map hand@@ over General and check out Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then check the text that is to be read , and choose Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre@@ he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also pre @-@ read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then check the text that is to be read , and choose Tools text in the main menu . then the speech output should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ i@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , noti@@ fying you about events . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you will be notified when your Nick@@ name appears in an IR@@ C channel . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ i@@ fy , appears a menu entry notification in the menu settings of this program . the settings for K@@ not@@ i@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for string release provide a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or faul@@ ty messages can be corrected . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; they are useful for improving pr@@ on@@ unciation , to replace wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the Screen Reader is pre @-@ read , the reserved jobs will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warning has the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the warning output .
News have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website you can talk with &amp; k@@ mouth ; al@@ erts are also messages .
&quot; the rest is simple text orders . every order , which you initiate orders from the card card , is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts which have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be further types of filters .
strings replaced parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions .
&amp; XML ; re@@ formers use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included are some X@@ S@@ LT files for the translation of &amp; XHTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaking selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a spokes@@ person for example . if you have for example set a female voice on the flash@@ card speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . si@@ z@@ e. read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to change the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ i@@ fication on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below . processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of standard normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns for the establishment of string translation filters . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as desired , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet by . the list is processed in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load or delete a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list .
&quot; here is a language written , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ trl key when you click the mouse . &quot;
&quot; here a value is entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID running programs are provided with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter copy . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to compile these expressions . &quot;
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the speaking selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the speaker board , or to a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , define that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , it looks for a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected using the spokes@@ man features that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card card . with the speaking selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s a value , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to receive help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here , specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected that meets the required requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your subscri@@ ber settings or to delete all settings .
the speaking selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; see the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

&quot; text of the text to read and select a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so SA@@ BLE works at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read websites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation signs seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so whole sentences can be ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ing @-@ w@@ avy is spent . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character enco@@ ding option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replacement filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download it from it . you will also find the source code from k@@ de@@ accessibility at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project site http : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
&quot; KT@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ th to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; for information that is not yet contained in this manual . &quot;
&quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts , you can connect to the development team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bug@@ ging , or downloaded the tar@@ ball every night downloaded , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , check first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way , that the setup of speech discs is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is split into individual sets . the user can reset , repeat or cancel by@@ laws or paragrap@@ hs . &quot;
&quot; if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the features of the preferred speaker for output . if you have set up a spokes@@ man whose language is English and whose gender is female , this is used , otherwise it is automatically the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a spokes@@ person , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add Spe@@ aker on the speaker tab , and in order to insert a spokes@@ person into the list or click Edit , the Card Player Setup will be shown below . for example , below is the setup of the module for Festival Interactive . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only need to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text that is passed to festival . in case of Vo@@ id @-@ 1 , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you adjust the volume , talk speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display this gray , the voice you selected will not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster ( with bigger memory ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a spokes@@ person ( or do not forget to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t run yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the Audio card . see also . &quot;
&quot; text orders are listed and managed here . editions of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information about &amp; kt@@ ts news types ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not be loaded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % is about half and 200@@ 0.1 % about double normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all the PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this card , you can set special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders and stops these orders . once the screen reader has read , the reserved orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
warning have the next priority priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages .
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders . for news , warnings and the issues of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; Not@@ i@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card noti@@ fications will appear . &quot;

&quot; speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . this can start &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with pre @-@ reading , as only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . this allows you to also jump or pause orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the set of pro@@ posi@@ tional filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of set filters is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will get out of it . &quot;
&quot; on the simpl@@ est way , you can learn the setup of the subscri@@ ber selection by simply trying out . switch on the list of subscri@@ ber orders , select which spokes@@ person &amp; kt@@ ts ; select the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the subscri@@ ber has been set up . of course , you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with pre @-@ reading can start , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can order or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal movement recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut down , only be removed . do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; Sent@@ in@@ el recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for punc@@ tu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ulator mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the punc@@ tu@@ ation limits ( tab@@ ular symbols are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard punc@@ tu@@ ation filter keeps the character set . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ night ) , warnings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the standard punc@@ tu@@ ation filter from default , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the card @-@ card speaker selection , you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the card card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card speaker ) . in other words : no subscri@@ ber properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate spokes@@ man , who has all the characteristics of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the spokes@@ person &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the spokes@@ man who most likely matches the original features . &quot;
select the method to enter desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature doesn &apos;t play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple mark@@ ers here .
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as primary property . you will rarely use this property . the only case you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is shipped in another language than the one placed in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all the properties in the area spokes@@ man , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker to use and then use the speaker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the entry is 0 required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get trac@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not resolved , you may need a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the console , a message appears , which states : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA can occur which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have invited an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not display this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / voices , add the new voice . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s like Festival Interactive can offer a setting for speed themselves on the card card for speaking devices . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) If you are bold , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very brave , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML trans@@ former filter , and set up the Spe@@ aking Speed . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not able to read pages with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that the festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file has to convert from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate string filter filter and now I can go to &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer proceeding or go back . on the top of the board , orders are displayed , the order will consist only of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter any punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for punc@@ tu@@ ation detection . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA &apos;s conflicts in the audio output . if your system is also included , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start reading a text . you can also find possible solutions for this problem on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 a@@ Co@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
Debian users can so@@ x install the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is available on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included .
have you downloaded and downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 will be the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
&quot; the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free , according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example &quot;

CD k@@ de@@ accessibility echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; In@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use it , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . &quot;
&quot; you have to install at least one language . help to find help in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the festival source code . the German voices are subject to restrictions when passing on . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to type MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 bit ) enco@@ ding like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore look for festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then , Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from the phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process , additional wr@@ apper code is added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ tuning files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices . required either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA , then download MS German Festival from &quot;
instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the inser@@ tion of the bug fixes is not required ; you only need to translate festival ) . then add the following lines to the festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices will not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this method uses special code to release the language via Festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; grab and install first festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; the Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice synthes@@ izer which currently supports only a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is normally included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . search Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer that works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the MB@@ RO@@ LA and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ hor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; on the card setup , select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o right . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ os is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the speaker tab click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and ep@@ os T@@ TS language Synthes@@ izer . if the ep@@ os programs do not stand in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the tab . enter in a console ; ep@@ os -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java , neither pitch , volume nor talk speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command , which writes the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which enables the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enables the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ . the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center are displayed ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured ready @-@ to @-@ use , thus enabling &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ . the device is shown at all and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases there will be drivers for network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option of network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this one tries to detect the platform used on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and release status . by marking the setting non @-@ re @-@ questions , the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are shown gray , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system administration mode , you can enter the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed .
the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... set up in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Automatic , the TCP / IP settings are collected from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information on each system startup , so no further adjustments are required . &quot;
&quot; with the option Manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or turned off depending on your needs . turn on a switched off network device by selecting the list and clicking the interface .
network devices can be activated or turned off depending on the need . switching off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking of interface ....
&quot; defines the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a host with DNS support replaces a full domain name through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks for IP addresses , DNS trig@@ gers this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be added to the top priority by selecting an entry and up or down in the list with the buttons on or down . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit menu will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the list of name @-@ known calcul@@ ators describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP Sub@@ system . it is used first and foremost when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list of known hosts includes some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , press de button Ad@@ ding several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a named host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog known calcul@@ ator will be shown .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings module are not immediately activated in the system . to enable the changes , it must be set in a console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm pack@@ ets ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console ; using rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ . the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given . in the second section , all configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is to be found . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point , which is a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area dedicated to this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , hence their arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , you will find the configuration files placed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content than set there in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file will be re@@ ass@@ or@@ ted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&quot; it appears the default node ; -@@ print dialog . if you choose to fold out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
print the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ on@@ tab to change the time schedules of the user . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX , to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; the first was to create a surface for tar . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of tar tar for quick , selective pack . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife ordered : how much longer does it take when you sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ ls the tape back and reads the pr@@ elo@@ ad information of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape does not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; if this is not found , you &apos;ll be asked if the index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changing the tape drive to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be disc@@ ar@@ ded without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band types must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting of &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not require format@@ ting before you use it . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , however , DAT drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the tape name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape away . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select View Sam@@ ples ...
&quot; once the backup has been secured , the dialog box will open . in this dialog , you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including data rate and time remaining . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test ....
&quot; once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder is recovered .
select the files you want from any of the archives with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work@@ folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the dialog appears again . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file on the basis of the band content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this volume . you can recre@@ ate the index on two types of the tape :
&quot; by doing this , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings will be created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all the folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same fil@@ esystem are the same as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be included separately from the backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently from the other . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
&quot; this setting is active , convey@@ ed &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is inserted the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , when releasing the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; change the hardware file size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ atted since the time when the tape was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who cannot know where you can get information about your system , or where the system provides the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system depos@@ ited the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , attempts to provide some advanced features to be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions , including : &quot;
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtering and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . if this is not shown , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files usually do not have permission to read in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion or by entered strings . the list of log @-@ lines is now automatically changed , so the list box next to the filter contains the item All . then a log file will only be shown if one of the columns contains the string of the filter . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will only be compared with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the process , and enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , so you will show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines sent and / or created by this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to detect the important minutes lines . protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as minutes lines of the level indicator . &quot;
&quot; if you want to display a particular process ( for example , in the system protocol or the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can find the process identification ( PID ) in the process . this can be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ Rail . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can select the option to pop up new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new add @-@ in protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple log files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you can find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming a standard for controlling the program start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( among other things because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without installing a new installation and reform@@ at@@ .@@ This is why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d . D@@ ort , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such items such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such items such as set@@ serial , which only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
r@@ c.@@ local should be / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one .
the standard Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and will probably find that the default level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change something , then you can fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a C , the script is called up with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another time device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n , or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only happen if you extract an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to re @-@ establish entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection top or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting code or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by re @-@ pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for proprietary development programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present that are needed by the respective system service ( and even if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated without notice if their configuration files are not available or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this guide can be attached to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double @-@ click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cards will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have configured space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , there will be a card card on which you can make individual settings . further flash@@ cards will appear , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card card password management appears , if Shadow @-@ Pass@@ words or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; this card will only appear if for at least a included fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , where the space restrictions in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be individually set for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the File System field with space restriction
&quot; the card board informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . the editing or del@@ e@@ tion of the selected user or group works similar . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , add the boot password , remove and change the time until boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
