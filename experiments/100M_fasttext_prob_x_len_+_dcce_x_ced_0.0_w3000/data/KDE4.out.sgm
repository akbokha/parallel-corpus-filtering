<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views so as to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView is to graphically represent nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportionately to its size."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, & FSView can be easily recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treble display represents a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colouring and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view colour mode, can be either depth for easy detection of the shading depth or the illustration of another file properties such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough room for representation or whether the area of subordinate rectangle is to be used (and thus, you can set the relative position of lettering in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for Treemaps performance algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. with the Tremping in & FSView, this target is not always kept. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the area of an entry into the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is up to the label and to prevent space losses through frame, so that rectangles are formed that are as square as possible. the best methods of this are lines, columns, or recursive division."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view of the area. instead, a room pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="65">"in the second field, you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">"later, you can add as many folders as you would like to add."</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a collection of images on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder containing images as a base folder."</seg>
<seg id="68">"you can not exclude sub-folders, unless it is iste in hidden folders. you can do this by inserting one point in front of the subfolder name."</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo out of the album and put it on the folder icon. you can find more details in the albums section."</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera appears as a disk drive. the camera can also be connected via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that support a steadily increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol that was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are in general large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection has meanwhile become obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be read reliably by some libgphoto2 camera operators in order to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not see thumbnails or production could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digipack; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (Manual) is one approach to develop a common module structure for & digipack;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to make the modules available to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier to complete, but by writing a small module to add a function than the changes to & digikam; even perform."</seg>

<seg id="82">"drag and drop images everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the tree, above the horizontal divider line or another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords, date list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"a file selection allows you to remove the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name will only work if this ind symbol is also displayed. which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the AlbenSettings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlistequot; put an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digipack are stored in a single album tree, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date on which the album was created first, the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album importing images directly to an album. you can also add a screenshot to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from an album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the destination album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to click on the album with the right mouse button and edit the album properties in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album- collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. collection of your photos is used when you choose to add or delete collections from the toolbar collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"the buttons eldest, average, New Year: these set the date on that of the oldest, the most recent image or that of the average section of the album. for this purpose, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first opened an album in & digipack, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot;. this is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and choose the album menu & quot; As an album preview; in addition you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be covered.</seg>
<seg id="95">The collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window displays the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"when you open an album for the first time, you need to wait for a short while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this in which you use the menu Tools to recreate all the thumbnails."</seg>
<seg id="98">"information about each image will be shown below the associated preview. what information this is, you can set up about settings digitized; set up. select the albums page here and customize the preview image to your wishes."</seg>

<seg id="109">"photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogise your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again."</seg>
<seg id="110">"if a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword are displayed."</seg>
<seg id="111">"tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by doing this, you can logically organize your keywords. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword liline, so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for."</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-controlled workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of image processing workflows. the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other photo editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone, why should one use another color space and then have to think about colour management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see will be presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor since sRGB assumes that your monitor is calibrated to sRGB. if you work as a color space of sRGB then you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before you attempt a further manual editing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, compensate, automate balance and contrast expand from the menu Correct Automatic correction attempt to automatically make the best out of your colors. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scars the luminous values over the whole picture so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing color shading. this feature is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"same: this method adjusts the brightness factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroyed it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic balance: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jiuscation of all values in between. this is only visible with selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited, since over a colour space with 8-bit per color is worked. if you can move too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochronym. you can start it using the color white balance of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitespace again, then it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">Preview the target photo has a red marker. the pixel of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"a histogram is shown that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your results depends on shade, saturation, and gamma. the shadow of alignment lets you improve the shading details of your photos or dimming down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play anstat with the controls mentioned above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it into a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button returns all filter values to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the code depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely distributed JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is available only for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. colour mapping can be done through the subwindow for brightness. a detailed guide to use color profiles can consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, allowing you to use it for several photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always require the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"it has four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when one replaced a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then reversed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally generates a negative image that is not to be produced on photopaper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and it works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an upturned colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colors and some photographers especially those who don't like the landscapes too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the results you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is set up for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here. concrete the three slider below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into the inside and they can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the controls and observe how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated with the settings of the image, updated. on the left hand side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box, it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, logarithmic classification is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark notes, the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammaids."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three colour-tweeters can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. in addition, the Gimp level format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shades, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overview indicator control all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below you can see an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2)."</seg>

<seg id="479">"& digipack; three different tools are available for sharpening, each of them has advantages in other areas."</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpened mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it sharpened not a bit, it works rather psychologically uell. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process must be combined with minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequent sharpening as normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a field filter already during reading the image. if you disable it, you will get the control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the Corrigate Archiving menu."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should be careful, however, as the results do not work very natural: sharpening increases sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you can achieve further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to make the image a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften the softmark and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter fuzzy is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or amount increase the effect. if you make the sharp mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats will create close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore they should sharpening images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the sum represents the percentage between the original and the wired image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fracture from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for a edge of the filter to be applied. in this way, areas with a soft switch between the tones are exempt from sharpening and hence beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). fuzzy masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digipack; tool refocused refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter -algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blur mask. refocussing reaches most often better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the Gauss'sche Fitting has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixelae that are far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of Gauß's folding is actually influenced by the removed pixels in most cases. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures the default value 1 should give good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: to increase the correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03."</seg>
<seg id="502">"in most cases, you should increase this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. in most cases, you should increase this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the edge-shaped sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the trimming, color and intensity correction on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, which leave later unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, blurred masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of the blur. for the Vienna filter, it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in handling small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has to be corrected with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of focus correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glätte sets the blur of the compartment that was darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows a custom color for pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the Reiter Glue and Advanced Settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail holding p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharpening is required."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film gradation or CCD noise will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it has to be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">"contra-angles da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. ensure that small angles generate a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as greatest and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integrated stride width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation: the more quality you get by selecting this option is only low. however, it doubles the runtime. we recommend it therefore."</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons save as and loading exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file, and later loaded again."</seg>
<seg id="528">"error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the break-off button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected using Small artifacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">Die & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce hydraulic noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases only the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">"a radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel is used and can disperse the image. the range indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch to the front of the filter to determine brightness changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value enhances the filter's frequency response. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerances of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which are typically mapped more strongly. however, it also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjustment of the phase of the phase. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges may appear smoother if it is too high, noise and phase jitter can occur to edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved into the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to make the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to soften softwood and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digikam; Photo Restauration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove palate's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequent digitalized images."</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square corners (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic corners (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="568">"many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 with the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with Center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter with the large exposures of today's filmenand the color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to apply the effect of a center filter without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three controllers, you can control the vignette correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light strengthening at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the vignette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the destination image with these options. the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings."</seg>

<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grade corrects the removed corners to that of the second grade. if you combine these two any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">"in general, this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, barrel-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the thickness of the fourth grade. this value works more strongly in the margins than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters section has the opposite sign of the parameter."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value rescaled the image size and thereby creates a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>

<seg id="585">"the spherical or cushion correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. in case you re-cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the false."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the trimming tool in the menu Repose crop selection from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motifs, such as photos from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective."</seg>

<seg id="592">"below the preview you can set two parameters set of film grading and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option joining film grading, if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control modifies the amount of film granularity and dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!"</seg>
<seg id="593">"since the filters mix colour channels for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos, as the colour information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the pointed lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"filter filming is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granularity on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed movies, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix great silver-grains of the photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film gradient effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photography, grainy sight specially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="603">"the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to start with it."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coherence filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>

<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the drop size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can select an area free of raindrops; for example, use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start filtering the filter drops, the area will remain free of rain drops."</seg>

<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information again, or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select the transformation size change in the menu and enter the destination values. the dialog is shown below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality, then try the tool to blow up."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digipack; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>

<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it has to be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and loading are used exactly. every single stamp for photo can be saved as text file and later loaded again.</seg>

<seg id="640">"editing a photo is not only a frequently underestimated operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"if you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be clipped by simply dragging it to the corners of the rectangle. simply create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The trimming button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save under the File menu to save the newly-cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool According to aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool According to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photopaper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">"at the bottom of the dialog, you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relation and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool According to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the trimming tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data is reflected in the image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the coax help allow help to hide your images better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussels or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides smoother relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third-third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"one more rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not a triangular triangles. diagonal to place these lines can leave a static object dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the editing points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options are mirrored and vertically mirrored to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it happens easily that you don't keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the digipack; image editing and the tool free rotation. select the transforming Free Rotation and adjust the destination angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the button Preferences you can reset the slider to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after turning a picture, you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair this is to use the function transformer trimming out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is Automatically cut the image. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the anti-aliasing option smoothens the image a bit after rotation, but note the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:"</seg>

<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little bit dirty. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean up this is to cut the image with transformer trimming out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the tool is used to shift a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal shear, for example, moves the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module over transformer shear."</seg>
<seg id="679">"scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles. if you press Preferences, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shear, the picture is wiped a bit. for a single shear, this effect is mostly negligible, but two chords generate twice as much understanding and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after sheering, the image has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is to cut the image with transformer trimming out of the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"and digipack; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compilized. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of formats with & digipack."</seg>
<seg id="684">"because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them."</seg>

<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use the JPEG format, you should not select the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG format as a storage format, the metadata that are included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif data."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion button to start conversion. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>

<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; add titles to the keyword (English: tag) when encoded MP3s with lame, the switch -tt needs to be added by lame and the title parameter by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of entering into the host. it is to note that here is only talked about text: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal but I (note from the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; any information that is publicly available on the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; actively select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (counterfeit) address than the one used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who has verified the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more about it in the source code... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the read-out WAV files, the encoder and so the desired file format can be selected. at first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined encoder. more information about encoders are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg, console)." lame 'must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder. "</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;)."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first & CD; read out. we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"you must have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine because it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can naturally always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is composed and that you own write permission (eg by trying to copy it into the directory).</seg>
<seg id="1547">"the first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator;, something that is probably done only once and"</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used to compress the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy we share the program to use the freedb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with each reading of a & CD; change when the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the device designations for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>

<seg id="1557">"the second drop-down selector is easier, a & CD; entry found, starts immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk when you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and file name will be changed with Konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb is not used. however, this is about 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card."</seg>

<seg id="1664">"so if you want to play a MIDI file a note with Patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to depict sounds on the percussion channel. take a look at the keymaps provided.</seg>

<seg id="2038">"if there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group."</seg>

<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"to create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & Menu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution)."</seg>

<seg id="2056">"backup into the correct folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be imparted to the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please fit your & descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) if a file is opened from the appropriate type."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create an & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you might be in the & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. first part we'll let you handle the second one here."</seg>

<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and consistently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used for designing the context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; -script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3, could be differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, many other useful functions have been added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"even 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and rejects the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check codes, you will like this feature."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visibly. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal and the other is different in one line, then the color shows which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to immediately define an output file. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two corresponding files, they in & kdiff3; load them and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you cannot remove anything from & # diff3; just drop the drop of text into a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the Info Line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.

<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2840">"currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is therefore currently focusing on the widespread IPv4."</seg>
<seg id="2841">"one of the most important information is the knowledge which IP address of a network interface is to be found. in foreign networks, on & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point, which is a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used."</seg>
<seg id="2842">"when setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area dedicated to this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, hence their arbitrary use is possible."</seg>
<seg id="2843">"of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateways."</seg>
<seg id="2844">"for smaller networks, addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines."</seg>
<seg id="2845">"in addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet."</seg>
<seg id="2846">"some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own computer)."</seg>
<seg id="2847">"the address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle."</seg>

<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, attempts to provide some advanced features to be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in the current version 0.4.1 features & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions, including:"</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtering and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open. if this is not shown, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files usually do not have permission to read in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion or by entered strings. the list of log-lines is now automatically changed, so the list box next to the filter contains the item All. then a log file will only be shown if one of the columns contains the string of the filter."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will only be compared with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the process, and enter the name of a process in the filterbar, so you will show & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines sent and / or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"this option is enabled in the default setting, and helps you to detect the important minutes lines. protocol lines of the level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as minutes lines of the level indicator."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to display a particular process (for example, in the system protocol or the Cron protocol), you can find the process identification (PID) in the process. this can be useful for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use FilterRail."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can select the option to pop up new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new add-in protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple log files in separate sub windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you can find more information about the sources of & ksystemlog.</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and as named) as & ksysv; this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly becoming a standard for controlling the program start-up of the system in the & Linux world, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (among other things because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without installing a new installation and reformat.This is why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort, you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such items such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such items such as setserial, which only once started. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and will probably find that the default level 3 is. if you want to change this, you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change something, then you can fix it by restarting the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a C, the script is called up with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another time device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only happen if you extract an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to re-establish entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting code or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by re-pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; otherwise they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>

<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are launched in these distributions, simplifies configuration for proprietary development programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present that are needed by the respective system service (and even if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminated without notice if their configuration files are not available or incorrectly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this guide can be attached to this manual."</seg>
