&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I have also grown up with American films , have d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run their sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound impact on me that I was a journalist chi@@ ef@@ ly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were willing to take his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; I was it , as if this is the absolute truth , I forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only intensi@@ fied my admir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ minded attitude . &quot;
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says precisely what he thinks of how a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americans and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can pres@@ election , was the highest number one ever achieved by the Party nomin@@ ee nomin@@ ee . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters in tune with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s world outlook did not coinci@@ de with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles with the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Del@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot during my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the voters to be rac@@ ists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white vote for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country they have disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. d . Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; word@@ play from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : &quot; hell with diversity , religious freedom , and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd broke . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America . &quot;
and it breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

&quot; what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ? &quot;
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome it with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you are always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , tim@@ pan@@ i and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 km south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ aly@@ a - a village that is located virtually at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recycled instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ aly@@ a , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all produced from the gar@@ bage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez rec@@ alls , a local econom@@ ist and musician of the children of Cat@@ aly@@ a , at the early days : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rub@@ b@@ ish . the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children . &quot;
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
&quot; today , there is an entire band playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic bage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - as people in Cat@@ aly@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational play of waste @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can combat illegal fishing successfully
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly prepared and little inclined to welcome a legislative criminal of this kind at its coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles swi@@ f@@ tly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused all , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team who discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was unable to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries to stop 2012 from the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are the six countries which had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic obstacles , and also through the sn@@ ail speed with information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , with tr@@ ack@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , by means of satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas - such , which indicate that a ship will beam its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al gi@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay for pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is then considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , deputy director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consultant firm committed to fighting illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year because of illegal fishing , which penet@@ rate into East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these illegal fishing fishermen .
&quot; among other things , actions include sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , identification of fan@@ ta@@ sies , fish shel@@ ters and fishing in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t have to run my port &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had spread counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us to the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of these ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find crimin@@ ally active ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Ocean Protection Organization : a platform that offers satellite data and that the position of each trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who &apos;s doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew char@@ itable trust@@ s has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals , but also deter them . &quot;
ships that had previously f@@ ished without license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences know now that they are observed .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i now list a 33 % rise in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ co 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also note these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries joined together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With certainty , the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ co 1 , a ship that was on the way under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship had also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the behaviour of measures against Gre@@ co 1 , they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a particular , collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea .

they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the response of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum in Venezuela , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country continuously deterior@@ ates , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the Fol@@ lowing Day , as well as a march to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores @-@ Palast , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was scheduled to continue on 3 November . &quot;
&quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is so far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores @-@ Palast .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the fairy tales that are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most frequently divided pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the guards : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures gathered about con@@ front@@ ations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
&quot; hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers don &apos;t have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which forms the scale of suppression a day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the province of Cordoba against his father in the course of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept family secrets .
&quot; at that time , I believed that it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who said before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made yourself friends with one of the ERP systems . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that they will not take you one day and I will have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; for that reason , he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become a secret agent . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
&quot; my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 . &quot;
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great lum@@ ps of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with an out@@ post . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
&quot; later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was just tied there . &quot;
&quot; it rarely fes@@ tiv@@ ates a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and pursued a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch inside was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ?
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were hoo@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down@@ wards - all were tied at hands and feet .
&quot; in the vicinity of the entrance , people were sitting still on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you think so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the civil ist Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina were accused of death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ zi@@ l , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way where the kidn@@ app@@ ings came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took approximately this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War@@ ran@@ ty &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war yield &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later in the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military Bad@@ ge , which one pic@@ ks against an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , record player , clothing , painting , money ... it is not a war yield , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you who stal@@ ked cars on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else !
that is how my father was .
I have no single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a rolled @-@ up pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothes to his house . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense was accused of being a con@@ voy of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel sorry . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have children only , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with her mother , who had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
&quot; I reck@@ on , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not have families whom were handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere , no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I simply said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought of displaying my father was created during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked me , what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have compelled me as a child to participate .
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well , then tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I ref@@ unded the first ad . &quot;
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending at the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 off@@ ences , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Trial ended on the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian members . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for it lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located so that there could be a memorial , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , in the last month witnessed a very un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word , the &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; , &quot; means &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; wron@@ g@@ ly - but also with vi@@ cious am@@ bush than@@ king &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from the 1st to 20th of September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was noticed by Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n daily newspaper wrote :
&quot; how could it become such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blog@@ ger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was deno@@ unced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , who are involved in accidents across the country , are certainly cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a proportion of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors rose 1,@@ 80@@ 3 from a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased over the same period . &quot;
&quot; the correspon@@ d@@ ingly un@@ named repor@@ ter brought comments to the light published on Yahoo in the article published on Yahoo , which show which pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese are apparently against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; is that ( &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; So er@@ ron@@ eous , the translation is actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error .
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre error in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and active language skills to transmit it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that transl@@ ators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a French native speaker should translate for example from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r User Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , which could translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that even do not have foreign employees can make translations themselves internally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is estimated as the best , is made for transl@@ ators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r User Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences , which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often decorate shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r User Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery , or at least harmless . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Kyoto uses a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship in the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ c@@ aster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ it@@ ters also took photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organised by op@@ position@@ ists who opposed the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was connected , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; special offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and dis@@ closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it is still cheaper than two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade to buy . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ I in@@ filtr@@ ations later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website at which the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds in@@ correctly or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third se@@ duc@@ ed channel , was arrested on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests to Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more and more difficult to access multimedia reports on current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ cket for a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers the testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ tics who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report from Kur@@ tural which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before gradu@@ ating from the University , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she , who has become of something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as a cri@@ cket for the family . in Paraguay , one calls more than 46.@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their min@@ der son or their min@@ der@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , an education and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children will have to pay inn@@ umer@@ able days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift up . &quot;
the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she said with Cri@@ tic &apos;s - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and deno@@ unced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude , which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ tics , is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , whose daughter lies in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of it &quot; &quot; is handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assi@@ mil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in sec@@ rec@@ y in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , has got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy beats . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra proposed a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ cket .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl , who was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be ground@@ breaking - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ cket
&quot; the Cri@@ tic tas are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik in which her father worked for bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
&quot; their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market , to make money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as a cri@@ cket to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time so that she was still time for learning . &quot;
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , puri@@ fied the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning . &quot;
&quot; the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time it had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to be hungry , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the host as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings the Hou@@ d@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand beside him and read editorial articles from opposition papers like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; while he was intelligent , he did not stop with her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened to while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family often because they thought I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there . so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak to their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the formation they had made , they declared . &quot;
&quot; she was , however , fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; a thing about which almost never was spoken are bul@@ lying and the chic@@ anes who are exposed to Cri@@ tics when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ cket . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;

the Society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which one can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and orph@@ ans in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrator of the group is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a counc@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the town of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ f@@ ty @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , who would like to work . &quot; &quot;
then the ph@@ eas@@ iness of the display turned out once more :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; Pix@@ ab@@ ay &apos;s image , modified by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regul@@ ating the use and usage of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when adopted by the Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt have to register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up which is entrusted to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a bu@@ ckle of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , consisting of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ids and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are not able to register the registration . it is uncle@@ ar how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telec@@ om ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of it , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I strongly believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they pret@@ end that just as they can forc@@ efully control both physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a trial . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Secretary of Parliament Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal situation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq &apos;s war

&quot; this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that w@@ anders through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; and the health and memory of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild game is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza wants to passion@@ ately reveal a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies on wildlife animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
&quot; since 2013 , she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region . &quot;
&quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and filmm@@ aker , produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , who was in the northeast of Japan , documented the progress made over the past six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a major pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were inevitably ev@@ acu@@ ated because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappeared entire coastal cities from the map .
&quot; yet the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress was achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
&quot; the report provides detailed information on M@@ erg@@ ers and Ac@@ quis@@ itions , Equity / Deb@@ t Off@@ er@@ ings , Private Equity , Venture Financing and Partnership transactions recorded by the company over a five year period . &quot;
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these homes , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma represents 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , Ev@@ acu@@ ated von Beh@@ el &apos;s under@@ tak@@ ings ( the &quot; &quot; bed@@ time &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; L@@ ech@@ o@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) will settle into final spare @-@ houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 more than 36@@ 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such lod@@ gings . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools who were affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors again until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have been largely affected . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to be able to find a complete picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the Ev@@ acu@@ ees . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her emp@@ athy has changed against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper says : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster @-@ causing , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside of the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , have been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside of their native pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees , who are still in temporary shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often sees that one more links than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was hit by police at country @-@ wide demonstrations

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 this week was delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday a police officer killed him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a head against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against as@@ par@@ agus .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
on the pictures it is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a whi@@ p . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police reported in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation into the incident . &quot;
the pictures show police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer sm@@ ug@@ gled out of a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive station , his face would be seen for six months on television and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ ters will ha@@ sten shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , internet users have now donated 10.000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

the drawing has been divided several times in social networks .

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the active Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been murdered by his father , because he was accused of the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police sei@@ zur@@ es
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber missi@@ les and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the deputy Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to disp@@ ense against demonstr@@ ators via speaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media sli@@ pped road protests by pulling the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ shield . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to illustrate their titles illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people , who serve to defend a special thing . &quot;
you must also recognize this if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Dest@@ ru@@ ction of Un@@ ch@@ art@@ ed Vill@@ ages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known , irrespective of that there is no notable sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after the rise , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete sm@@ ells remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some ex@@ changing the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories which still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already imp@@ acted the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market price , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but bad crops are not a new thing anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway sti@@ ff@@ ness of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated , and they were hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Food and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day will certainly enter into history , &quot; &quot; that was the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , got their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all of the respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them has been informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first anniversary , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially included documents , which would only be distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the nursing factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still commissioned in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped .
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work producer has been extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for employment and services that generated the plants in the congregations where they were . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , who then saw the President in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run smoothly . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better , when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to disman@@ tle it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and sustain their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
&quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this through hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop managers are bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by educ@@ ators David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop focuses on the fact that the young participants deal in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ perception &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved here got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody ever wanted to be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
&quot; this is the day , in which you will take our cry . &quot;
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and continue our youth as well .
so they can do what they have determined to the Creator .
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

&quot; in Japan , plastic courts can be seen in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( s ) , &quot; &quot; Plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; are issued by any dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo @-@ G@@ a Tokyo district , there are many of these small companies that make the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them . a new trend , however , turns them into striking mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic boxes decorated cell phones as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Store department store .
&quot; many of these artificial food items were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y coll@@ ecti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin free@@ zers mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new Boom of Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming more and more complex .
in this case a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple holding your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing departure into the com@@ edy .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own artwork . in this case ik@@ ura or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes may also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic tri@@ bun@@ als can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of fighting against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ icking . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ erable and killed regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reports on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ning or the churches who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ing a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime cannot only be feared for our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive entire communities to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost their father only one day , lost their four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing for the task that we have asked ourselves to seek , and search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you stand the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a mort@@ ality certificate . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ès a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and the state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the page pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( german : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is as if they mo@@ ck those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something has happened to them . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , when stories become mere figures in statistics . &quot;
&quot; the Tat@@ el@@ essness of men is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; listed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to admit that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main town district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this , it describes how armed criminals get money from their business until they had destroyed not only the business , but also their family torn apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can completely change your life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain beyond that never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are distant from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I wondered if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The forgotten kids of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how about growing in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy , for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks away from his home that saw bloody cor@@ p@@ ses of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence led to the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the citizens &apos; council for public security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the soul of the country .
only a few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ès a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages linked to it include images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lift a rum@@ or or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something first appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ led to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this wrong coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank wagon crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , it fell victim to that of the tank wagon . &quot;
&quot; the representative described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema near , which was full of people watching the FIFA World Cup . &quot;
houses burned and destroyed cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of char@@ red bodies , which are str@@ ing@@ ed on the ground while people watch them . &quot;
but here history does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been updated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an settlements of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count bodies , &quot; &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were shocked , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated visually . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also uncle@@ ar , but the Bag@@ a military base was a permanent conflict between military Nigeria and the B@@ oko Har@@ am attempt to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo showed again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this frau@@ dul@@ ent use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments , such as this example , fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations described those who could flee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this image origin@@ ates from an Saudi Arabian news site , which wron@@ g@@ ly claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein said , monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to depic@@ t this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also wron@@ g@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated with the picture of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach of false data
traces of this false coupling reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mask of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have limited examples of the ab@@ usive use and associated it with the respective countries , on the basis of which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also linked together ) , several examples of ab@@ usive use may arise . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be fully spread ( on the card in orange ) :

country examples of wrong cop@@ pic@@ es of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or false reports .
&quot; the countries in grey are examples , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also fal@@ si@@ fication examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( judged by Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blog@@ ger from Quebec City men@@ tions not only the false announcement , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án quem@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the paper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; we@@ ather@@ ing after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this one , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have clearly not seen pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ sters who contra@@ dict this . &quot;

&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;

&quot; even inside Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was divided as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , a twe@@ et , the sympathy of the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blog@@ ger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persec@@ uted to del@@ usion , since the photos were ab@@ usive . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government published a right to judge what it was &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this recti@@ fication , which was exclusively published in English , also contains references to fake images of rum@@ ors that run H@@ ate Speech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and mig@@ rate ( which is often common by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the picture of DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was admitted in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and the image continues to contain it at the time of this release .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it asser@@ ts that there is a &quot; &quot; similar &quot; &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later came into circulation with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Um@@ lauf , the El Pa@@ is Zeitung tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ eted ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative figure of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the 2010 original accident , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions on the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ seh@@ ood suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does it dimin@@ ish the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of for@@ ci@@ ble images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern is that for@@ ci@@ ble images of readers and viewers des@@ ensi@@ tise and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how for@@ ci@@ ble media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about for@@ ci@@ ble portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , Fak@@ t is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be detached from the context or completely mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; however , any examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Blog reveals uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used according to CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ transl@@ atable ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot;
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known today ( like the famous Portu@@ ges@@ e ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or phrase does not suff@@ ice , why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Imag@@ ine your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years .
words spoken in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
k@@ w@@ adi - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after you have war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they dissi@@ p@@ ate other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ transl@@ atable ones , are invited to upload their favorite no@@ uns here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ds of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earth disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following a statement from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and sl@@ amm@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after additional rainf@@ alls are already on their way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are ready to transport emergency supplies to the inhabitants of their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also become more willing to help .
fac@@ ebook sites like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims , &quot;
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the &quot; &quot; Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u &quot; , &quot; Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then transferred to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge . &quot;
&quot; they also conducted a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding water and land@@ slide . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need for security and help to aid aid measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; as in January , I attended the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and a dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her four years old daughter , she trust@@ s her children ; she is my rock in the Brand@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in the first minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we are chann@@ eling rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they dis@@ grace me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we do not all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective performance , that as soon as Muslims like I do not fit there will be dis@@ connected . &quot;
to be missed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dism@@ issed the story behind these images . &quot;
but these images still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ ad@@ dle them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narr@@ atives over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women had led to their countries during the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , who guide movements for change . &quot;
it is about the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it delet@@ es the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ inflammatory attacks and chic@@ an@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the nature in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1.7 billion are
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the highest &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ Russian Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scrap@@ ers ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan was re @-@ thinking the world lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ rational Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now ir@@ resist@@ ing Mus@@ lim@@ a and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ bag that all Muslims wear with themselves - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I am jo@@ king , we do not carry all hand@@ bags with us . &quot;
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widely spread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islamic refin@@ ery with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the nature in which we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility lies in more than just a stranger who tears the head@@ scarf . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the ritual ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and her the Arabic verses for protection , which seal the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

use approved .
&quot; affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother mat@@ ernal side with her sisters , as they gain a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi Holy ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost reversible . &quot;
being Muslim means speaking the prayers they had told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; being Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Me , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that was col@@ oni@@ alized for centuries - by an &quot; empire &quot; which was founded by a company named Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tian Ost@@ ini@@ dien Company , it has a profound meaning to call God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my acc@@ ent grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; while he writes books about the modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt over his family in India , family , which he was not allowed to close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at play . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means to know that over the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first aviation bom@@ ber of history was disc@@ ar@@ ded over a Muslim country in front of a century .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ ish sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim strain of 1.7 billion belong deeply into our unforgettable family trees ; our in@@ born history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , except Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate under veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , called Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave . &quot;
it means to know that a hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties acci@@ dentally , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the dimin@@ ishing second @-@ ness &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from precisely the countries that bombar@@ ded it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we carry , and the bombs that we disc@@ ard towards Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scientifically intri@@ cate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to carry
&quot; we are too deep to expose the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous forms of expression we have in our news editorial departments . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history in many cases . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square via black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is , but today I have made me a must @-@ have Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections our humanity is about , a story may be noisy , where someone is made one &quot; &quot; another &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations took place within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms that we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why would I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago , scientist of Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ even questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously to rein@@ force the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we had no president , while he was already broken down by countries and &quot; &quot; made &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ r@@ ative Art intends to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin live in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has been running events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project apply :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; while &quot; listening often is often linked , &quot; these events are instead &quot; listening to &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story in their own language first and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and depic@@ tion lead to the fact that the audience respon@@ ds to it . &quot;
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the traditions typical for her country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide smile , he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
they were with me !

&quot; with the aim of a re@@ test of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , on 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march was launched at the Capit@@ ol Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ anes . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front for the Neur@@ on of Deb@@ t ) and the Com@@ en@@ ical Church Assembly in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working condition corresponding remun@@ eration , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we will be pres@@ sured and supp@@ ressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt , which is not thei@@ rs . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the state @-@ owned territory of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed without the participation and convic@@ tions of citizens to be dism@@ issed by the people .
the demonstration took the name of &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for freedom and remind of the contributions that he has provided for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publishing company produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , published books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how to build motion for free knowledge , and what the real costs are connected to . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side @-@ side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create something meaningful from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information whatsoever about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what did we give up at times of extreme convic@@ tions in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; his place of residence and condition remains unknown , however . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes were fores@@ ee@@ able than the work he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of many civi@@ liz@@ ations and mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this journey into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet finish this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was already in custody .
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; in addition , G@@ haz@@ i is the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a sab@@ bath she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 to her husband when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for a year .
&quot; she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English . &quot;
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens during each visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers is no matter for me , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
&quot; and I shall enter into every detail of your voice , and your words . &quot;
&quot; which I carry with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes bid f@@ arewell
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my sol@@ itude , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I am persu@@ ading myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el :
&quot; a year goes , my soul &quot;
during the month
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
the story of Bas@@ escu &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the 2011 protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention until 2016 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release back to previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger towards a corruption , where a member of the government returned to the State apparatus after half of his sentence to the state apparatus at which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants for the un@@ tre@@ ading of 54 million marine persons ( around 800 000 euros ) . &quot;
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique whose advice was presented by Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement issued by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who made the motion , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to refer back to his old posts as the company did not take any disciplinary proceedings after his arrest . &quot;
&quot; however , many people don &apos;t mean the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to set up the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note of is that even the company should have in@@ stituted a disciplinary approach against the counter @-@ acting .
&quot; however , the company apparently did not make any reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic social media , also decl@@ ines this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; re@@ war@@ dly &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza is a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had been lowered . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
resist !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not possess any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him . I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing to return to the state and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in jail . &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only to remember the Mozambique Channel for ever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ cutting and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations , when he was vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was able to sell even the Fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also dis@@ appro@@ ving : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and was released . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting legs .
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ por@@ ted &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; ( in Burma ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically invo@@ ke hate speech . &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use .
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , stool is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ lower ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ca@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question @-@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before spreading all posts that are under suspic@@ ion to spread racism . &quot;
Facebook delet@@ es the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , spreading the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new policy on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the li@@ king , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards did not meet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned the words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a great deal of revenue , that would be great . &quot;
Chrom@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ri@@ dic@@ ule among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t reveal any hate speech , but were still removed : &quot;
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; only to test if Facebook removes the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure , the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked more on context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end to the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the child @-@ marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the parliament voted unanim@@ ously to adopt a law to prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the sp@@ ouses , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Human Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , every human being under 18 years of age . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago were 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 from 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were anxious to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to tell the critics of the baby before they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubt arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against child marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stain@@ ed - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law .
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle has posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; after it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws for pa@@ edi@@ atric use had finally been changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which conce@@ aled the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the baby &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is almost worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , it took me long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , &quot; Excellent News ! &quot;

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and it seems to release his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it is quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to tackle the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; rather Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of the problem , would simply talk about the fact that the state , our daughters against them are ab@@ used , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the inf@@ ant is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they submit . &quot;

&quot; since more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day after day becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information as well as reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains blocked , there are now multiple mirrors ( pages reflecting the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content , however , can be retri@@ eved despite legal prohibition . &quot;
&quot; in a blog@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the locking by Wikipedia ) , we used everything to lay snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents on a de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
IP@@ FS also provided that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mir@@ ror@@ side from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla at Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; you access another URL , which is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; in essence , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia site , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
&quot; a su@@ cking r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him , never satisfied . &quot;
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to engra@@ ve the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nepal stri@@ ves to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ an wildlife . &quot;
&quot; he described on Facebook , how this first @-@ class location helps in his work : &quot;
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to cr@@ ush images ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as sc@@ ary as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , for he rose from face to face from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of Bu@@ z@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; in order to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photos of Ot@@ tern in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist information . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ mp@@ asa and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest di@@ ligence to prono@@ unce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pr@@ on@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure , and fear of the consequences should they keep the norm in keeping this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after having contacted a married k@@ ins@@ man with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also by name is also common among men . however , they have far less allow@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , came with a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place just for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s he@@ aters , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and manages these clubs . &quot;
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion , acted by women who do not call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; to prono@@ unce the name of their hus@@ bands too loud , is a custom that they are all guilty and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try out at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was in the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never speak the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise , she only gig@@ gled in front of him ; another decided to release the entire frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received numerous reports .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women into his head , his wife could not stop saying his name . &quot;
another club member decided to do it dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scar@@ ed and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ ouses : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zinc @-@ red dot if he did it too . &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion with each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never spoken so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say things loud , no matter how small they appear to be . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; most of them is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ty Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ versy and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code , morality combined with sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion lap so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped telling the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and are not other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as fishing for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - lying at the end of a difficult navig@@ ating river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and reports to other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les arrived in Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail@@ er Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;

&quot; in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community in the market , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of temporary people for the organ trade , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently given that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man can reveal gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on gl@@ are @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the target of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to the UN in 2016 , in the South African country , carried out a mission to investigate this practice . &quot;
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who plan to travel into the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who are travelling to Mozambique , are target ritual attacks , the mos@@ que police warned about the latest assass@@ inations of three men faced by men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police were already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the men of glass .
&quot; the persecution and murder of glaz@@ ed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has commissioned the police of the Republic of Mozambique in view ( PR@@ M ) , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a faith existed , according to which the victims were in power , the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ ger poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Mozambique is facing : &quot;
&quot; I like to use E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH embarrass@@ ed A country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , a nation where people would not hurt or even take their lives in order to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purpose or &quot; black magic &quot; will be hun@@ ted , which aim to achieve a snor@@ ing wealth . &quot;

&quot; free b@@ asset : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident L@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made just recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized in the hospital for liver cancer .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Li@@ us case an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this affair with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Li@@ u &apos;s case . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot;
Norway ( EN )
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about her release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government concluded that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed until December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume salmon farms to China as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ us as she said in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; U.S. ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad shared that &quot; &quot; Americans &quot; &quot; want him to have the opportunity for the treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US Embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere with isolated and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife . &quot;

&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive &quot; all the medical assistance needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the top priority . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reuters that China had big concerns , whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u might over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada ( EN )
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says :
&quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old the freedom of expression . &quot;
France ( EN )
&quot; in a statement on June 29 , France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family are to have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news agency France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information about whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan manufacturer : Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the continental affairs in Taiwan called for China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in a statement on June 28 , indicating that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u Well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and had been severely punished for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , marked the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries . &quot;
he supported that Singapore should be considered as a city .
no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had an escape from the responsibilities , a duty violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , it appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam have been given responses to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system . &quot;
&quot; for such questions , he tar@@ ried with non @-@ answers of rational nature . &quot;
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ ck to clarify his opinion as it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to what country is our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point as long as it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; as An@@ on published his comment on the blog , he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities could win a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously does not have it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ ho , who is the leader of an adol@@ escent generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review sets out the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam have &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , but do they only defend their city ? &quot;
who has to pay our Prime Minister In@@ voices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore pri@@ des itself and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this phrase seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice channel &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your place of residence or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I asked most about in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I replied . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication then follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly with anger if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other them . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans can attach a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves to their luggage in order to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marriage has been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot;
Canada is alleged to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were to switch myself with Johnny from Dallas , for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; nice &quot; means , basically , to be fun - just like the nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can meet . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not deserve attention .
&quot; that can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what external standing as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ aphr@@ ases Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular pop band released in Thailand released a music video released by the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite their promises to restore the civil government , the country continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend makes him .
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video still refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , the video was uploaded to Facebook 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 likes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these recordings of the video which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may relate to the dra@@ in@@ ic section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making authority over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; change in settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and uncle@@ ar rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit in the army was established , the online content super@@ vis@@ es and persons accused of being accused of having condemned the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand sets a stri@@ k@@ ward against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Viol@@ ation ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened by long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the band &apos;s te@@ aser showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ute from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East @-@ East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ish war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ sch@@ asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together at Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russia and Ab@@ k@@ h@@ ens live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cl@@ erg@@ y@@ men . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are tr@@ apped and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ow@@ kas , which still host one or two families , can be seen at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately retreat . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dj@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Asia Minor to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
aunt G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A tells her that she and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit . &quot;
&quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A to her . &quot; they said , we could grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ational partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s allowance for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
&quot; but over time , she lost her anxiety . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; as our conversation is near@@ ing the end , a little boy adm@@ its to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him afterwards .
&quot; he plays with the ball , who then rolls down the hill . &quot;
a group of children now tracks the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the abandoned buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , who care about in@@ genu@@ ity in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it otherwise .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez deri@@ ves a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ X and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in a ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; it is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
&quot; there is no sign for the hotel , but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also have slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
she does not want to reject anybody .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medicines they can &apos;t pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey exhausted feet . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a mou@@ st@@ ache ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to arrive to Boston in order to find her husband and the three children there .
&quot; you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together , and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are going to greet them or to report about the course of their trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he started helping them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valencia declares that he knows what the guests go through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived there for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his work site . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open doors to their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single traveler , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family is still living there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , travelers consult their phones quietly . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she bl@@ oss@@ oms in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair pla@@ ques that she made a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she briefly presents her to me .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , who are of the age of Twitter , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , mobile users received a phone notification in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi &apos;s Ti@@ an@@ shan district , in which she announced the District Government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they , shortly after having installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the app would detect and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting about digital cens@@ orship in China is mostly focused on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet , based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point , where polic@@ emen were random@@ ly checking out whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use appliances intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity due to the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; images from &quot; &quot; China &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Certi@@ fied Atmosph@@ ere &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description out of which the software can lift up the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receive un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the statements of the City party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the party connected to the party including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi by order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death - Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you are looking at yourself and realise that you are all alone in a place where everything important has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one who makes all glory to their name .
one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into essence from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts dis@@ solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the earth is on the axis of evil . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by even destroying the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the districts sought , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ res@@ sive , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t have any high demands on a city that was stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state @-@ security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to work together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a glorious picture that filled my expectations full and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; Be ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he set up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have shot it all the way up to the office of security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me also hear you cry &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes focused on me .
and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was due to my fol@@ ly , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my thing when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret the word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was suspended for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ eive all details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have given me a larger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and can immediately put me without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I went back to an old @-@ tried communication method : with the fist to beat against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ bree@@ der was a &quot; &quot; self @-@ chief &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , no striking facial features can be seen in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds similar to mine ? &quot;
all the answers den@@ ote his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s that lab@@ ored in the garden of my head .
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear them cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always around this time the scre@@ am , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which showed us the horror in person : the throat ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion on the 13th Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus the secret was aired : to protect the state security from us and to prevent the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close look of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is no country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet in Abu I@@ mad , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least it seems to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions he escap@@ es : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start to close this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and hits after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , though I did not have done anything to earn that penalty . &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cri@@ es didn &apos;t have enough for him enough , why they exchanged the tube by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us , from their point of view , a great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within one hour three of them changed from them while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling , and didn &apos;t find any fav@@ ors at all , which is why he took an electri@@ cally charged staff next to an electri@@ cally charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to supply my entire district . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours left , which seemed like a minute . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ fu@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; I am answering with the voice of an exhausted person : &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside , sometimes he sl@@ anders to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking , and can feel his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ like against U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Refu@@ ge of the second generation , &quot; he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into the water of Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the blows of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the cal@@ ves of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when one th@@ rows a glimpse into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to end in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert table . &quot;
the MP and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the established legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to commit themselves to intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simple rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear emerging reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b drew back traditional gender men to be dead by depic@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who had married sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently shel@@ tered unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , the number of &quot; &quot; Hon@@ our kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still worse that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence , in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law for inter@@ ruption from 1954 , women , who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence , can be held in jail for an in@@ definite period of time , and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s music is very popular and is known to not shy away from themes that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , he adm@@ its that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ usions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was inti@@ mid@@ ated by politics , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are political in the core , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; what one wants &quot; - whether faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of homosexu@@ als and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality have been cens@@ ored in 2014 by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Japanese online programme , Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments were torn from the context , distor@@ ted and in his opinion were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without any cuts , but only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not about Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ des , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory with his homo@@ erotic poem . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ ts , who later worked on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service established several former members of the teaching alliance , with the reason they had vo@@ iced their criticism in social media comment@@ aries on the issues deeply rooted in the land . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ b concert is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is what H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is being approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial kind @-@ led democr@@ acies . at least it hopes . &quot;
&quot; until it is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also contribute to resistance . &quot;
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting that A@@ man listened to as student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one suppos@@ es that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fort@@ resses , the drums and the dancing are mar@@ ched over more than one thousand years and come from a time in which armies mar@@ ched from the west of Japan to the native inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is hard to imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two fort@@ resses are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ tall car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rare , outer appearances and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the one of the Fris@@ eurs . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug traff@@ icking are everyday . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go to the experienced hands of Fris@@ iers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud of , because of love for the children we have built up this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ers &quot; , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve released . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel pushed out to accommodate aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this question , the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , inspired her to contribute to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ ación ( L@@ etters to Recon@@ ciliation ) which encourages young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their share : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ err@@ illa war ( German : Revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; for many years , gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ers , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans joined together and would have to help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 L@@ etters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who will then be personally handed over . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s day , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I would never have thought that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done before , in order to accept the commands of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness , and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior brought me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters were living ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL Gran@@ at@@ Designer , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; I still spoke to him , saying , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life has someone written something so beautiful , so I answer it . suddenly , I suddenly got tears on the che@@ eks . &quot;
I h@@ ug@@ ged him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , he was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the famine . &quot; &quot; I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society there that is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; as a pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects the entire Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; listening to these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people , whom I often had seen as a monster , and even hated people with beautiful feelings , which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men , including those who were killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a h@@ ug . &quot;
many former war@@ riors have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ armament of peace there would be peace .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take up arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our path , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; gay and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are subject to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the coverage of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which is like a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ worth over the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , has not only emerged overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published that dealt with the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of que@@ ers in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , and cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who captured suspic@@ ious que@@ ere men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equality of their wives , the hunt was opened to Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear for her life , she ultimately moved to the United States . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can remove this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you sc@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and eventually wo@@ ke up at the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had got everything along and started crying . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung . &quot;
OC Media : in which sick leaves you were laid - in which the men or women of the women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they put absurd demands : some said me , I must prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that all was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have bas@@ kets size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a sn@@ are around her neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved her .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with sh@@ aded window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my Human Rights Friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought it , without registering , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe me , you &apos;re in safety just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo theme . &quot;
&quot; some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements , I still carry in me . &quot;
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person that she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for that I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock out a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there still gay men tr@@ apped in these secrets ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there would be not very many . &quot;
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives , to present themselves to Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but were specifically di@@ pped in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they just took it along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports about it . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already took place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite big , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately pushed us back into the stone age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes jeans and short Tops . &quot;
the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria has never scrat@@ ched me only one hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole town knew about it , they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language , there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t say about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period have ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : what action are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , gather@@ ings , I accompanied her to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I have no p@@ enny for it .
I discovered these people myself when I cut down the type of refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
&quot; so nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam before the mouth , that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ an have , the cab@@ ard@@ ines who , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to me to hear anything . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transi@@ tioning to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not harm myself for my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself now .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups , who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly manage to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ un hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the internal @-@ combustion engines were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything any more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that there were some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fa@@ ther@@ men who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families , and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took over power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian fields , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries . &quot;
the rate of unemployment among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi teenagers has now risen to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ kill@@ ers among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process .
&quot; as officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab labor powers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and to be hired as even Arabic names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional view &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even lay well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist women . &quot;
&quot; for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer twice and triple among them . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet : when I speak to skin color , on racism , on black women women , on black women women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , many white femin@@ ists decide to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya to sing my Lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we face black women in two ways . &quot;
or above that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women to have the same rights for all men and all men of any skin color ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect myself as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in their thinking , which relate both to the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner spoke in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a ent@@ angl@@ ed and margin@@ alised being in an historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women to suggest the importance of the over@@ lap of skin color and gender , because some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to bor@@ row from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of campaig@@ ning for a white femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we conquer ourselves ) speaks of us that we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter @-@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women from other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm . &quot;
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm owing to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life neither passed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here . &quot;
&quot; again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who uses and works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the adverti@@ sed advertisement of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was also useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman went back to her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women make ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , are at all reporting to the prosecution authorities . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ t@@ 1 Stri@@ ps and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system , which contains nothing sub@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to find out how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are various reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an independent criminal off@@ ense , prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; until August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

&quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system , which takes nothing &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then still gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she carried the psych@@ ic force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious : &quot;
I never thought I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women happen to be sub@@ missive , because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had enjoyed this so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave it earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse , at least , had some complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psych@@ ic abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country where it was mainly about money , power and influence of her ex partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which became known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # prin@@ cely ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Lon@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to explain the fem@@ icide to an independent crime and to pun@@ ish harder as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus the law was changed in a number of points in order to win the MEPs for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is generally banned , which is currently banned in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years of imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill fores@@ aw the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must bear in themselves , if they simply restore advertisement and get a safe place to impose on the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot;
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the perpetr@@ ator &apos;s off@@ ence . &quot;
we must reimbur@@ se so long until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re @-@ attack His sacrifice .
&quot; however , the sub@@ mitting of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman filed a year after a newspaper ban
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; to read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the sult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court but returned later . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having dism@@ issed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the har@@ sh@@ al efforts of security forces , especially domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public freedom , including press freedom , restrict freedom of human rights , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , inti@@ mid@@ ating and incar@@ cer@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its establishment in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces captured I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , after having appeared in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having pressur@@ ised judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise an opinion in an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Editorial Board , was charged from the ISS by the Special Session and was arrested by the security forces upon arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS accepted the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the Court in Mas@@ k@@ at the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted , among other things , for distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of a violation of a ban on publication and sl@@ ander@@ ing . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after making use of &quot; an information network for dissemin@@ ating material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit was set in the amount of 5000 Euro ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to res@@ ign , the newspaper looks still exposed to attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister turned again against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press in recent times .
&quot; other injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ain@@ ment of the journalist , Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work and can exercise without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including legal chic@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather and protect themselves peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , shown with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research carried out on @-@ site : many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare system which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps build its own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; it grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he investig@@ ates himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ish national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
&quot; I am also star@@ ing a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
Q : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being a maker . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
where does finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries . &quot;
Q : how is the research infrastructure ?
which barriers are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards developed in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa versus western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
the system that magazines make articles only available against payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine describing solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has grown up in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ness , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity , and the question of how many Sal@@ at@@ ees he can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as grain and cart@@ on varieties . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate expon@@ ent of a m@@ illen@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still re@@ tains salad , but it needs longer since his work becomes more difficult and more difficult . &quot;
it &apos;s as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der lying around which I have to d@@ ouse .
&quot; so we have to make it right now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in front of court , nobody can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and makes no effort to use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it has also joined a movement that is growing bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( open source breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for open source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free open source software which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders can commit themselves to free use of seed @-@ bred seeds . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only permit others who buy seeds , to breed it , and not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the Emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , it therefore plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , the rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to exploit the latter , or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not concerned with gene@@ tically modified plants .

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus increasingly available , constantly shr@@ inking . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , employed in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; there are still not such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that large cultivated plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Ques@@ tion of Vis@@ i@@ bility
&quot; plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specifically desired tra@@ its - from such by which their taste or colour improves up to such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and maintain threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts the view that intellectual property uses other breeders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees the other : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly promotions no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight already . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary stimul@@ i are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ ed with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are necessary her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , will breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exact opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move in international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents possess , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes that breeders through the avo@@ idance of plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; it looks as if I with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my ri@@ vals are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , making it easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide response &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe . &quot;
&quot; in India , the centre for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligations for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( the rules for breeding differ from country to country , which cannot be taken over by the O@@ SS@@ I obligation to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official starting signal should be planned next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report published by aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from Lu@@ by by O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly focused on where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to make people clear that even more is behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest Zen@@ orship targets in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it sharp@@ ly critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains , despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who should defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to un@@ cover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network of Qatar for alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of webpage locks to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in the Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spreading of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s cens@@ orship , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blog@@ ger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is native , on the other hand is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video , as police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to block blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , then it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has succeeded in providing me with the feeling of a si@@ ege . an arrest , an attempt to murder , un@@ load at the National Security Council , blocked blogs and any other web site for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I took it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courage@@ ous go the way through to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities closed on 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; it also documented the block@@ age of vendors , which enabled Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) . &quot;
she reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the block@@ age of websites that offer V@@ PN@@ s began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content on the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decision decisions are made behind closed doors , causing the Egyptian population to have no legal basis through which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?

&quot; newspapers throughout Brazil report in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second @-@ largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es smoking pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , naval and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached its highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazil Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . , but what happens in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to cry out : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the paper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; har@@ ms more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of the public service . &quot;
reminder : the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the mor@@ als per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; these security measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the police units deployed by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police order and permanently station@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of chic@@ anes and repres@@ sions against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . to this end , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ break@@ able point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; mis@@ led spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war round or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week ago , the police took up the hill with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad &apos;s regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative by the PA@@ X Peace Organization and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where chemical weapons attack on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations committed by the massacre of the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have been under si@@ ege under si@@ ege under si@@ ege , which led the inhabitants to be reli@@ ed on locally produced or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become in@@ accessible to large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food strength makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P &apos;s French news agency : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to know this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more . &quot;
&quot; in order to raise funds for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge about planting mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la zu Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € but will continue to collect donations to cand@@ o until Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started producing mushrooms from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they were suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; after that , they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people of mushroom farming for various reasons : &quot; &quot; frac@@ ture of the si@@ ege . &quot;

&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege is visible . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rag@@ ing in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia Region of Spain where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions spread out in the northern and central regions of the country , and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande made a similar tragedy , where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured were injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors forest areas by satellite imag@@ ery , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the Rem@@ ark@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al by the government of the farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday , they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the forest reform , which the government introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law that permitted the construction activity , if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; leads Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light fire@@ able wood , are spread more and more like in a vi@@ cious circle . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence Ministry of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the own civil protection information with the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina , in order to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers didn &apos;t stand on the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , lived in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say so then , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was to break . &quot;
his unc@@ le would fetch him and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Hez@@ bollah dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ break@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af was again in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot;
once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar which were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his livel@@ ihood .
&quot; at that time , like today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af spent his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago , A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to need@@ y two times a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that , due to relatively high levels of awareness , Italy is a second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can take months for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also called A@@ shar@@ af .
but his ir@@ repres@@ sible li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after having made several years of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af was putting his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snap@@ shot .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venice luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years a number of Afghan @-@ owned companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants emerged . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his Oriental restaurant where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant peace &amp; amp in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na pizz@@ eria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans to open a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghan people on this path .
&quot; citizen report : Egypt &apos;s accus@@ ations allow the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , has been in jail for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the clearing of the bearing Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the release of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ies Ne@@ tizen report is an international snap@@ shot of challenges , victories and emerging trends in global internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament scrut@@ in@@ izes a draft law , which envis@@ ages that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
&quot; those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months in prison , or the execution of a sentence . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament submitted a law proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; Egyptian law is already pun@@ is@@ hable by the President as well as state institutions . however , under the law proposal , such a fact would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took a photograph of Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators fighting against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 prot@@ esters arrested at the same incident , four years in jail to a date of trial . &quot;
&quot; recently , his hearing was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May because the prison administration failed , according to human rights groups , to bring the def@@ endant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty because of a , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do @-@ charges of inter alia ar@@ mis@@ tice , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ pers@@ eded murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted of the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists inter@@ rog@@ ated documents
&quot; Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly li@@ stens to a negotiated action plan . said plan stems from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill of law , which would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused Official am@@ nesty , provided they all withdraw all un@@ lawful money . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ ath , sheds light on how the preventive plans for the support of the legislation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused the nom@@ ination of his sources according to article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Code , which gave journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
the rules also indicate that the registration will be required with the full real name .
&quot; analysts suggest that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks , and so far it is uncle@@ ar how the authorities will apply these rules . &quot;
&quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ am@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; Organis@@ er of Information Dis@@ sem@@ ination . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is carrying out a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to blame for the removal of content and force them on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ gor@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court decre@@ ed the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication reported that the site was blocked because it led to &quot; an information source working together with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop to sni@@ ff around
&quot; according to documents sent during this week , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring powers that Internet service providers would force to monitor communications in real time and to de@@ cryp@@ t the data encryption programs . &quot;
&quot; the government has cons@@ ented to telecommunic@@ ation companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has om@@ itted other technology companies and the civil population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , consultations will continue until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
