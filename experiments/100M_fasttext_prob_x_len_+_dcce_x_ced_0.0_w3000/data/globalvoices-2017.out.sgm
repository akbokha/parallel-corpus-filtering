<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I have also grown up with American films, have danced to American music, read American authors and run their sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound impact on me that I was a journalist chiefly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate, who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were willing to take his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free according to Method Man," "I was it, as if this is the absolute truth, I forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country I have ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he deals with his narrow-minded attitude."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops the mountain, as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says precisely what he thinks of how a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmericans and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won with the Republican preselection, was the highest number one ever achieved by the Party nominee nominee."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters in tune with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps's world outlook did not coincide with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles with the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Deley, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot during my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump broke his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the voters to be racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white vote for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country they have disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm. d. Ü): as much as" "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities" "; wordplay from white in allusion to the whites and Whiplash, which means as much as the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America's promise and says:" hell with diversity, religious freedom, and the whole concept of pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd broke."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan ended with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome it with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi writes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you are always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, woodhorn, timpani, timpani and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 km south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Catalya - a village that is located virtually at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with recycled instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Catalya, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all produced from the garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez recalls, a local economist and musician of the children of Catalya, at the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rubbish. the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire band playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic bage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>

<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational play of waste-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can combat illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practised solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly prepared and little inclined to welcome a legislative criminal of this kind at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles swiftly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused all," "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was unable to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of looting the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries to stop 2012 from the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are the six countries which had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are equal and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it is about illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, head of the Pew charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystem can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic obstacles, and also through the snail speed with information between individual countries, the actions happen today in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licences, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, by means of satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas - such, which indicate that a ship will beam its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a penal gister."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay for punishments, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there is then considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, deputy director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consultant firm committed to fighting illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of illegal fishing, which penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these illegal fishing fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other things, actions include sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, identification of fantasies, fish shelters and fishing in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-seamless organized control system," "says Long." "earlier a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "you don't have to run my port". ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" "Come to me". "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us to the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of these ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminally active ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Ocean Protection Organization: a platform that offers satellite data and that the position of each traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who's doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "Pew charitable trusts has a similar project in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are indications that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had previously fished without license and hardly had to reckon with consequences know now that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now list a 33% rise in fisheries sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greco 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also note these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries joined together in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "With certainty, the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures can also be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October, Greco 1, a ship that was on the way under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and used towing nets that are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship had also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the behaviour of measures against Greco 1, they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a particular, collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lumps of silver."</seg>

<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and were hooked."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" "Chubi" "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian, who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face downwards - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"in the vicinity of the entrance, people were sitting still on the mattresses."</seg>

<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you get me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me about it.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero put together a man and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement from above came that they should be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>

<seg id="276">I simply don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I answered: and you who stalked cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with rage, struck me and cried:"</seg>

<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he nevertheless brought clothes to his house."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense was accused of being a convoy of this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay down to me what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="293">One develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, so you have executed people during the dictatorship. but why do the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl with her mother, who had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I reckon, it was simply decided to kill these people. but why did their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families whom were handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abominable act that one can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I simply said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought of displaying my father was created during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations because of all the atrocities I had to experience.</seg>

<seg id="351">"the mistake was noticed by Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>

<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was first removed. the term" "drivers" "(German:" "terrible drivers" ") was later replaced by the appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct term" "elder drivers" "(German:" "older drivers" ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already included in the text they received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt insulted by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers, who are involved in accidents across the country, are certainly cause for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a proportion of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors rose 1,803 from a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has increased over the same period."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text and active language skills to transmit it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"in this way, a French native speaker should translate for example from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, which could translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that even do not have foreign employees can make translations themselves internally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is estimated as the best, is made for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and puzzling sentences, which arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique can't replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often decorate shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery, or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, Kyoto uses a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="420">"she, who has become of something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began to work as a cricket for the family. in Paraguay, one calls more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their minder son or their minderage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, an education and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children will have to pay innumerable days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift up."</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she said with Critic's - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude, which is inoculated by the Critics, is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," says Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, whose daughter lies in the belief that she will complete her training, improve her position in society and" "make something out of it" "is handed over to another family."</seg>

<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the so far unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secrecy in paraguayan households, has got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of heavy beats. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was in the household of the former military hospital Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived in her house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira proposed a stick to Marín until she suffered deadly injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cricket.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted practice of Criadazgo responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>

<seg id="449">"without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a cricket to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time so that she was still time for learning."</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, purified the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time for learning."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner it was done with learning, the more free time it had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>

<seg id="500">"Pixabay's image, modified by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating the use and usage of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when adopted by the Parliament, users and users of social media in Egypt have to register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up which is entrusted to give citizens a permit to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a buckle of money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, consisting of six paragraids and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are not able to register the registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password from the telecom ministry to get through the firewall that blocked Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of it, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not yet known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technologist (in German" senior research technologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they pretend that just as they can forcefully control both physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement be successful or not, the draft" is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in the Parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration on the image surface is present, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of leopards that wanders through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and memory of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild game is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza wants to passionately reveal a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, who was in the northeast of Japan, documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a major prefectures in Japan's northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring Prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were inevitably evacuated because the tsunami had disappeared entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"yet the prefecture of Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress was achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">"the report provides detailed information on Mergers and Acquisitions, Equity / Debt Offerings, Private Equity, Venture Financing and Partnership transactions recorded by the company over a five year period."</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare-houses (saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned spare-houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of these homes, whereas Fukushima represents 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, Evacuated von Behel's undertakings (the" "bedtime" "of the" "Lechoetsu juutaku" ") will settle into final spare-houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 more than 36000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such lodgings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 per cent of the Fukushima Evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful."</seg>
<seg id="558">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools who were affected by misfortune have opened their doors again until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, have been largely affected."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of the agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fukushima are located in the" nuclear barrier zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far off."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to be able to find a complete picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the Evacuees. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her empathy has changed against the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper says:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>

<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the situation of the Evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disaster-causing, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 Evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside of the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, have been resettled into permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside of their native prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the Evacuees, who are still in temporary shelters, are older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the rise, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete smells remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>

<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>

<seg id="641">The old railway stiffness of the church saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and they were hardly competitive for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">"they left only the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Food Organization."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this through hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop managers are bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop focuses on the fact that the young participants deal in talks like" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-perception "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved here got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the strophe is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever wanted to be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the miserable and killed regularly appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reports on drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourning or the churches who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Apring a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" to live with drug trafficking ")."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime cannot only be feared for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive entire communities to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how afraid life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for his son every weekend."</seg>

<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never returned." Emma Veleta: "it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>

<seg id="771">"you stand the insurance of my father, but she does not pay them out because they require a mortality certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where shall we get it?" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Après a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid of. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and the state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the page pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (german: drug dealers) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is as if they mock those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something has happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">"I see our weakness, when stories become mere figures in statistics."</seg>
<seg id="788">"the Tatelessness of men is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "listed". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to admit that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months of blackmail in the main town district: how a family was plundered with threats. "in this, it describes how armed criminals get money from their business until they had destroyed not only the business, but also their family torn apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain beyond that never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers also."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the more we are distant from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, for you don't know when they kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I wondered if weeping would dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article "The forgotten kids of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How about growing in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potatoes, tortillas and make" chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"but they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy, for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier, when he was just a few blocks away from his home that saw bloody corpses of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence led to the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the citizens' council for public security and government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor counted 3103 killings. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories still live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Après a Vivir Con El Narco, "animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank wagon crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>

<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been updated several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>

<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unclear, but the Baga military base was a permanent conflict between military Nigeria and the Boko Haram attempt to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture from the DR Congo showed again, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:"</seg>

<seg id="917">"United States, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="918">"the picture was weathered as evidence of the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retweeted). but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context."</seg>
<seg id="919">"instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative figure of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to larger discussions on the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are dozens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood of mis- and falsehood suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and does it diminish the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of forcible images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that refusing images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, concern is that forcible images of readers and viewers desensitise and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how forcible media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about forcible portrayals in the news media, Fakt is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be detached from the context or completely misused."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, any examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="950">"most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of" Untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, telling stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin live in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has been running events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listening often is often linked, "these events are instead" listening to "to appreciate, to feel, to feel."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers present their story in their own language first and translate or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and depiction lead to the fact that the audience responds to it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the traditions typical for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the beak of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is that to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a wide smile, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all those inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers."</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico claims to be re-established by the United States</seg>
<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a retest of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, on 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march was launched at the Capitol Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juanes."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente ciudadano por la Auditoría de la deuda" (Civil Front for the Neuron of Debt) and the Comenical Church Assembly in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working condition corresponding remuneration, which acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressured and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt, which is not theirs."</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not find themselves with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not into the state-owned territory of the United States - suffers from a serious financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-governmental non-profit organization with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed on the outside will be jeopardised without the participation and convictions of citizens to be dismissed by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how to build motion for free knowledge, and what the real costs are connected to."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side-side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create something meaningful from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information whatsoever about his current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up at times of extreme convictions in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military facility."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and took note of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"his place of residence and condition remains unknown, however."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge to the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes were foreseeable than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of many civilizations and merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture, which not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This journey into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet finish this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"in addition, Ghazi is the author of waiting (waiting), a sabbath she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 to her husband when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English."</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger towards a corruption, where a member of the government returned to the State apparatus after half of his sentence to the state apparatus at which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for the untreading of 54 million marine persons (around 800 000 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique whose advice was presented by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on 19 April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement issued by the Attorney General of the Republic, who made the motion, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to refer back to his old posts as the company did not take any disciplinary proceedings after his arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people don't mean the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to set up the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note of is that even the company should have instituted a disciplinary approach against the counter-acting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently did not make any reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosaic social media, also declines this behaviour and considers the case as" rewardly ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza is a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had been lowered."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resist!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not possess any morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he insulted him. I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza is missing to return to the state and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself on the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a hand it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splitting legs.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "Kalar" "(in Burma) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" Kalar "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, stool is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(splitting blower),' Kalar OAT '(camel) or' kalarcaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" Healing "(ku) + the question-word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before spreading all posts that are under suspicion to spread racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" "Kalar pae". ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone, spreading the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new policy on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the liking, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook Community standards did not meet." ""</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned the words like" "chair" "or" "peas curry". ""</seg>

<seg id="1345">"before this change of the spouses, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, as that, age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Human Rights Convention, the minors as, every human being under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago were 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 from 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, which were anxious to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to tell the critics of the baby before they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubt arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against child marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the Senators of the country posted a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle has posted on Instagram:"</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the child's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and no one against it."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after it was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for paediatric use had finally been changed.</seg>

<seg id="1393">"since more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful information as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technology-savvy Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (Nr. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship by Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains blocked, there are now multiple mirrors (pages reflecting the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"the content, however, can be retrieved despite legal prohibition."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we heard the news (about the locking by Wikipedia), we used everything to lay snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents on a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also provided that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrorside from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla at Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>

<seg id="1411">"in essence, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia site, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him, never satisfied."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to engrave the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepal strives to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepalan wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">"he described on Facebook, how this first-class location helps in his work:"</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage."</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was and I immediately started to crush images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as scary as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he rose from face to face from face to face:"</seg>

<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of Buzhek appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"in order to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photos of Ottern in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist information."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalympasa and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid the greatest diligence to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure, and fear of the consequences should they keep the norm in keeping this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted from the Indian State of Odisha by a false court and violated by her family and the village community after having contacted a married kinsman with name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also by name is also common among men. however, they have far less allowances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, came with a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community Video Volunteers and advocates for the mining of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices such as children's heaters, to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected individuals, and manages these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion, acted by women who do not call their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands too loud, is a custom that they are all guilty and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try out at home as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this confidence in the luggage, Rohini launched its first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas in the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise, she only giggled in front of him; another decided to release the entire frustrated frustration against him and his family by cursing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received numerous reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women into his head, his wife could not stop saying his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said:" "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinnoberred dot on the forehead, which indicates the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinc-red dot if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make an excursion with each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never spoken so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say things loud, no matter how small they appear to be."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most of them is okay, but some wanted to wear a salty Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code, morality combined with saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion lap so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped telling the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and are not other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as fishing for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothing - lying at the end of a difficult navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and reports to other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" News from those who experience it themselves, "and provide a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized in the hospital for liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" "Subversion" "after having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto demanding the democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Lius case an" "internal affair" "and told a spokesman, he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this affair with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>

<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Liu's case."</seg>

<seg id="1639">Norway (EN)</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs Børge Brende refused to answer questions about her release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian Government concluded that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed until December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon farms to China as exports have been largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>

<seg id="1654">"the request of the US Embassy attracted a furious response from China to itself, with the utterance of the State Department that" no country has the right to interfere with isolated and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs. ""</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">"the question may seem silly, as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had an escape from the responsibilities, a duty violation."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, it appeared invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam have been given responses to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"for such questions, he tarried with non-answers of rational nature."</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmuck to clarify his opinion as it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country but a city, so to what country is our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point as long as it was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"as Anon published his comment on the blog, he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore is more a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities could win a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore is not a country," he obviously does not have it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuho, who is the leader of an adolescent generation, making such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another matter."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review sets out the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam have" "believed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore make their military service, but do they only defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay our Prime Minister Invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>

<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, especially "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>

<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued over the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez derives a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, on the border from Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRIX and appears here with kind permission."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in a teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars per night, guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"there is no sign for the hotel, but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some also have slept outside on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medicines they can't pay, they massaging them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey exhausted feet."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a moustache) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to arrive to Boston in order to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells us that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together, and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they are going to greet them or to report about the course of their trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started helping them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencia declares that he knows what the guests go through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work site."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open doors to their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single traveler, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family is still living there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, travelers consult their phones quietly."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she blossoms in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair plaques that she made a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she briefly presents her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats them every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users, who are of the age of Twitter,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, mobile users received a phone notification in the Tianshan district of Urumqi's Tianshan district, in which she announced the District Government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message it is said that the app" "prevent access to terrorist information". ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they, shortly after having installed the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police said that the app would detect and follow the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting about digital censorship in China is mostly focused on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet abstentions."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet, based on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint, where policemen were randomly checking out whether they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use appliances intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity due to the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" "China" "(" "Certified Atmosphere" ") also published a Jingwang product description out of which the software can lift up the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receive unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the statements of the City party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and the party connected to the party including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a current report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi by order to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside, sometimes he slanders to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and back to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced himself to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felicyees (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questioned her old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking, and can feel his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special dislike against U.S. foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as" Palestinian Refuge of the second generation, "he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," "says Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he poured into the water of Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the blows of lukewarm coffee and the calves of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first line of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when one throws a glimpse into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"for this reason, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to end in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert table."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokesman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which questioned the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to commit themselves to intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simple rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear emerging reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib drew back traditional gender men to be dead by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who had married sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently sheltered unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, the number of" "Honour killings" "has increased in Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still worse that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence, in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for interruption from 1954, women, who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence, can be held in jail for an indefinite period of time, and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family that the woman will not happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music is very popular and is known to not shy away from themes that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, he admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was intimidated by politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are political in the core, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words," what one wants "- whether faith or non-faith, heterogen- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of homosexuals and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been censored in 2014 by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Japanese online programme, Roya, to later notice that his comments were torn from the context, distorted and in his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without any cuts, but only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals is not about Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nudes, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory with his homoerotic poem."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuts, who later worked on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service established several former members of the teaching alliance, with the reason they had voiced their criticism in social media commentaries on the issues deeply rooted in the land."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaib concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is what Hdaib sees - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing" it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is being approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial kind-led democracies. at least it hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is done, Hdaib will continue and therefore also contribute to resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting that Aman listened to as student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one supposes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the fortresses, the drums and the dancing are marched over more than one thousand years and come from a time in which armies marched from the west of Japan to the native inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is hard to imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gayoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gayoen for a long time: two fortresses are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-metre-tall car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rare, outer appearances and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the one of the Friseurs."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens go to the experienced hands of Frisiers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions exist on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud of, because of love for the children we have built up this educational community."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the article" "Love messages to guerrillers", "which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve released."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel pushed out to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question, the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, inspired her to contribute to the campaign Cartas por la reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation) which encourages young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their share: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla war (German: Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Colombians there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"for many years, guerrillers, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians joined together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 Letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who will then be personally handed over."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's day, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never have thought that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done before, in order to accept the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness, and everything in between, "said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior brought me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters were living) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL GranatDesigner, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I still spoke to him, saying," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life has someone written something so beautiful, so I answer it. suddenly, I suddenly got tears on the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of the war, he was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the famine." "I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"as a prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, its ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects the entire Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"listening to these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people, whom I often had seen as a monster, and even hated people with beautiful feelings, which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men, including those who were killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that after the disarmament of peace there would be peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to take up arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our path, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horror, activists have witnessed the coverage of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">"but the threat, which is like a Damoklesworth over the local LGBTQ community, has not only emerged overnight."</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya took over the international headlines several months ago, after reports were published that dealt with the deportation, torture and killing of queers in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"the first report was published by journalist Elena Milashina in Novaya Gazeta, and cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who captured suspicious queere men and put them in secret prisons in argun."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after having experienced a group of Chechens from the gender equality of their wives, the hunt was opened to Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear for her life, she ultimately moved to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there is no more men in Chechnya, who can remove this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round by WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a men's voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" how long do you want to dishonour the family, you scandfleck? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had got everything along and started crying."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which sick leaves you were laid - in which the men or women of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it to do with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they put absurd demands: some said me, I must prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that all was just bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskets size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the entire Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a snare around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved her.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with shaded window panes and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights Friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it, without registering, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe me, you're in safety just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"some traditional Caucasian elements, I still carry in me."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person that she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For that I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock out a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so that I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so called" honour "has experienced blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men trapped in these secrets?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there would be not very many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives, to present themselves to Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but were specifically dipped in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took it along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports about it. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people, who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already took place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite big, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civilisation", "but ultimately pushed us back into the stone age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were hatched; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubes jeans and short Tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the Sharia has never scratched me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole town knew about it, they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechnya language, there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't say about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period have?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"those who had laughed and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, gatherings, I accompanied her to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I cut down the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam before the mouth, that there are no bobbins with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestan have, the cabardines who, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they are - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to me to hear anything."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transitioning to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not harm myself for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups, who want to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly manage to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talegun hospital in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the internal-combustion engines were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that there were some others - Hamid Manifestat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathermen who felt helpless and unable to feed their families, and to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime refuses the Ahwazi Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of dams, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian fields, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The rate of unemployment among the Arab ahawzi teenagers has now risen to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of self-killers among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process.</seg>
<seg id="2424">"as officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab labor powers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace, let the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional view"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even lay well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist women."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women encounter a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer twice and triple among them."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet: when I speak to skin color, on racism, on black women women, on black women women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, many white feminists decide to keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their voices and "Kumbaya to sing my Lord" to achieve equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it, in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence that we face black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">Women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women to have the same rights for all men and all men of any skin color; on the other hand, I can't connect myself as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in their thinking, which relate both to the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner spoke in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a entangled and marginalised being in an historical sense."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women to suggest the importance of the overlap of skin color and gender, because some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to borrow from white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of the Womanismus, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of campaigning for a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and go into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming ourselves (about: Africa-Womanismus: how we conquer ourselves) speaks of us that we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and inter-sectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women from other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm owing to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life neither passed nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">The mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that has reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be re-published here."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again, Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special request by the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," Musa says. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who uses and works to protect the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film in Erbil, Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on persecuted, unnoticed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, whose help suppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article is part of the series # PorserMujer (# reflicheinefraubin) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her partner, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another wife Balbuena showed for mistreatment, the advertised advertisement of Ada Báez was also useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman went back to her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women make ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, are at all reporting to the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"inhalt1 Strips and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreatments and a legal system, which contains nothing subnimmt3 Paraguays Law: good approach, poor implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to find out how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research facility in Paraguay." there are various reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, there were 9600 ads on domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for mental abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman who is refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," she said at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide in Paraguay is not an independent criminal offense, prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"until August 2016, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">"invisible mistreatments and a legal system, which takes nothing"</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then still gave up. this should be regretted for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she carried the psychic force on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women happen to be submissive, because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had enjoyed this so long by Carlos and didn't leave it earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse, at least, had some complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country where it was mainly about money, power and influence of her ex partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguays Law: good approach, lack of implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the announcement of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the paraguayan parliament, which became known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# princely)."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, shown with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media. it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research carried out on-site: many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare system which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists, helps build its own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Center for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he investigates himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sambish health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambish national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with lab tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"I am also staring a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">Q: what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being a maker."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">Where does finance and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">Q: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which barriers are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards developed in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa versus western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles only available against payment (the so-called Paywall) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine describing solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has grown up in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredness, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity, and the question of how many Salatees he can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as grain and carton varieties."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate exponent of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still retains salad, but it needs longer since his work becomes more difficult and more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if in a river there is a boulder lying around which I have to douse.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to make it right now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in front of court, nobody can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and makes no effort to use any material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement that is growing bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding (open source breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Römersalat variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for open source seed) is inspired by the movement for free open source software which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of seed-bred seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only permit others who buy seeds, to breed it, and not immediately send out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the Emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, it therefore plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, the rights of farmers, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter, or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, he says and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples include the merger of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to making their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patenting seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus increasingly available, constantly shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, employed in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are still not such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that large cultivated plants like wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such by which their taste or colour improves up to such, because they thrive in certain environments and maintain threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property uses other breeders, since" patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes them by making more material and know-how available to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly promotions no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary stimuli are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interfered with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breeds a variety, also breeds its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are necessary herbicides, will breed in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exact opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move in international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto) patents possess, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton believes that breeders through the avoidance of plant patents would be more innovative:" it looks as if I with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalog, since I know that my rivals are selling my varieties in a few years," he says. "with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years, making it easy for my opinion." worldwide response "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly across the globe."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the centre for sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol is working on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligations for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(the rules for breeding differ from country to country, which cannot be taken over by the OSSI obligation to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for" Open Source "seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official starting signal should be planned next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report published by aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also stresses the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from Luby by OSSI hopes that more people will soon recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly focused on where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so," says Luby. "we now try to make people clear that even more is behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language issue of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Qatar for alleged" support for terrorism.

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video, as police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>

<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content on the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the decision decisions are made behind closed doors, causing the Egyptian population to have no legal basis through which they can proceed to court against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached its highest level in Rio for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazil Non-Governmental Organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crime, etc., but what happens in Rio will be published in the" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to cry out: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for several years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of chicanes and repressions against poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>

<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for the people."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia Region of Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spread out in the northern and central regions of the country, and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, Pedrógão Grande made a similar tragedy, where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured were injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas by satellite imagery, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>

<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the forest reform, which the government introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a slackening of the law that permitted the construction activity, if the applicant had funds for self-defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built," leads João Sorval in the same article of the paper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of light fireable wood, are spread more and more like in a vicious circle."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"in addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence Ministry of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when people sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used the own civil protection information with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina, in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the servers didn't stand on the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2875">"at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, lived in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf was again in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a few years, he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">Once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar which were heavier than he himself to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf spent his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous passage on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time ago, Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy two times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that, due to relatively high levels of awareness, Italy is a second chance for expired asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers from a general lack of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can take months for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also called Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>

<seg id="2933">"in order to be able to use social networks, users must register within six months of successful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months in prison, or the execution of a sentence."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the law, which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"in May, another member of Parliament submitted a law proposal to be introduced in the tougher penalties for the insult of the president or a high officials."</seg>
<seg id="2937">"Egyptian law is already punishable by the President as well as state institutions. however, under the law proposal, such a fact would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy."</seg>
<seg id="2938">"should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned."</seg>
<seg id="2939">"in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2940">"a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took a photograph of Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against demonstrators fighting against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohamed Morsi."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protesters arrested at the same incident, four years in jail to a date of trial."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"recently, his hearing was postponed to the 20th May because the prison administration failed, according to human rights groups, to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"Shawkan threatens the death penalty because of a, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-charges of inter alia armistice, illegal assembly, murder and superseded murder."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"in another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza was acquitted of the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi sitting blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years."</seg>

<seg id="2947">"Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Ben Gharbia was mainly listens to a negotiated action plan. said plan stems from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill of law, which would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused Official amnesty, provided they all withdraw all unlawful money."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"the document published on April 21, on the website of Nawaath, sheds light on how the preventive plans for the support of the legislation look like."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"Ben Gharbia refused the nomination of his sources according to article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which gave journalists the right to protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness."</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">"according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2954">The rules also indicate that the registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"analysts suggest that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks, and so far it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules."</seg>
<seg id="2956">"Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively, in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence."</seg>

<seg id="2961">"this designation is part of a law dating from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government is carrying out a list of online services that will organize the" publication of the information. "the law also allows the government to blame for the removal of content and force them on request to suspend user data."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"these websites are currently websites such as Vkontakte and Odnogorniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services."</seg>

<seg id="2966">"it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is thus, among others, China, one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible."</seg>
