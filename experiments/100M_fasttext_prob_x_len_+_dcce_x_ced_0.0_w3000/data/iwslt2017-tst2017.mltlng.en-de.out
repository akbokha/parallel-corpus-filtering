that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that N@@ SA had listened to illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if this sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not liked the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has decided against crack and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this move , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Am@@ end@@ ment of the Constitution , the media has the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something exceptional happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can still hide less .
&quot; instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , got his phone numbers secretly , &quot;
&quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit , and even travel information with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers and fis@@ sur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more condem@@ ns than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of a whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers who went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on them all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can do so from the moment in which they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that has not yet been written , when tears have written its book , and it is much safer than regular email or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source distribution system for whist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any standard contact form . &quot;
they are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot obtain more information , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to make sure that not only technology separ@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental colleague , who suggests the alarm for the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data le@@ ak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; huge sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and attor@@ neys go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , over a narrow friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agency killer or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads . &quot;
and that affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret control o@@ ases are used by some few , to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are less reports on this issue in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there were so far no prominent Americans who came in these revel@@ ations this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans , who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , you need less information in some US states to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children off .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Bar Companies in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all up to one lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as single cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we have to change the rules . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder .
&quot; this may sound very glo@@ om@@ ily , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot of things to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen preced@@ ents for more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme was political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters at a national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see such Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who become angry when they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies . &quot;
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he said he would go to the Corps of Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to end up in the boot of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh dear ! &quot;
a stranger sl@@ um@@ ps in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , embarrass@@ ed at ti@@ thes to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood , actually friends who just waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we take a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ agu@@ ed , my ro@@ ommate is pulled out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe creativity can create it , to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ ommate , Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and breakfast each morning . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure , our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I stopped . &quot;
had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
&quot; so we presented to the investors : &quot; &quot; we want to create a site where people share public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can invite other people to stay overnight . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you don &apos;t mind the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your phone .
give your un@@ locked cell phone to your left sitting ro@@ omm@@ ates .
&quot; this silent pl@@ ough of panic , which you feel right now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time . &quot;
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
most guests feel like they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; only once , who is actually Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he can@@ di@@ fies for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name , if he had told how he came from , how his dog or his children were called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 reviews , all of them say , &quot; &quot; He can hold really well un@@ locked phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you had to hand off your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to dism@@ iss negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
&quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation sticks out simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le art works in your apartment ! &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put aside these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly : a need , which was previously un@@ covered . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who un@@ allowed parties to celebrate parties or rav@@ aged flats .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at front of the front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million booked nights had ever been a problem . &quot;
for people trust one another at law .
&quot; when trust works , something wonderful can occur . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to be heart inf@@ low due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past . &quot;
they can stay longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is going on . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is a commercial trade .
&quot; but now it is simply to call the &quot; &quot; Rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel today , this is comparable to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; however , what if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you are visiting , a group would be eager to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood where you have never heard of it ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from scratch to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces owned by the government , &quot;
students who were looking for a place to stay
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were pulled out . incub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why has it just worked ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeply rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
every time I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for the future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply delay in the check @-@ up at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
&quot; probably , people don &apos;t talk about their U@@ ber drivers . &quot;
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual muscle .
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , I was able to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted passi@@ vely the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ asted the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , fully understands you , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people ran out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock soon turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do this ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists , ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; came down ... &quot; &quot; ... ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; &quot; bombs Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how to w@@ ander -- as we rode sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday that week , the day when Muslims gathered for prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again the warnings heard , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslims , drag@@ ged and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain themselves .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it just raises the question : are we vi@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumour in the body of the US but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olymp@@ us . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques of America safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking spaces free , but not stop the terror . &quot;
regular visit to a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant people in other beliefs and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of the radic@@ alisation process one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to the world of creation , when one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; sacred book . &quot;
&quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom they spoke , brought them to silence , and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had made sense of their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and His church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept in mind to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you submit news reports in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood strikes against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public , to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; in the allocation of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Yus@@ or were a young , married couple who lived at Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has I become such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , had assass@@ inated them , just like the sister of Yus@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . &quot;
he spent eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we talked about it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that we can control ourselves by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I have collap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had the courage and sympathy of panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or you will join those who think : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thank you !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a ment@@ or with drau@@ ght are working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I am totally normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is shortly before becoming a milli@@ on@@ aire business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air par@@ c@@ els rush into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting each other , flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ resistant structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be coll@@ ectively aware of where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors , in order to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e. g . &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other starter drives , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind @-@ bu@@ ds .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often present basic abstract questions which can become the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago trained pilot operated flight devices could fly away , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear wheel . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ istic remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ der , no other actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the interior life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move across in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in secl@@ usion , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; in this way , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is shot or even rotating . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things can be illustrated in models , the rest is learned directly from flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see it .
&quot; if planes should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
this is clock@@ wise .
and the other against the clock@@ wise direction .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however something goes wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; the particularly safe machine , on Broadway , would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; about 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were cir@@ cling around each other in a very distant galax@@ y , so they transformed the mass of three suns in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; first of all , we arrange the events in a timely manner . &quot;
&quot; a total of 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life on Earth was created . &quot;
&quot; since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is up to us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courage@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which could be caused by col@@ li@@ zing black holes . &quot;
most of them kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to clarify some small , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after commissioning the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zing black holes penet@@ rated through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; in essence , it was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cri@@ mp@@ ing in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched into one direction and gest@@ ures into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative , lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often give a really al@@ ber@@ ty dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and di@@ gest@@ ed at the arrival of the waves . the elong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured precisely to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about grav@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the waves as follows : &quot; technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because in this way you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the lights coming around you . &quot;
&quot; in killing , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you very much : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just say Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob dis@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; dum@@ b Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot easily create images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we turn wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; sh : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just run : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies turn very quickly , you hear the same p@@ ie with an additional sound change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement of movement , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what he has to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold s@@ uns@@ creen that rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , rot@@ ates a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
this is the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe from them .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes happen at the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own night lights . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watched them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year , I would say &quot; yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly that , I was afraid , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the Sm@@ all@@ est , calls all &quot; &quot; cookies &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; cookies , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on I swear to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sag@@ a for playing with my kids saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things are aw@@ aking up to life .

I am a titanium .
porn @-@ Movie with Sex@@ y@@ Sam@@ ira
I scre@@ am TV . I produce television .
&quot; I do watch TV , in a large scale . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , which burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who &apos;s doing this yet ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;

I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work so that you can understand that I don &apos;t just walk around on the computer and it &apos;s true , when I say , I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I get into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it &apos;s when I set up troops , when I painted on a screen . &quot;
&quot; so when you make a high sound , run a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
&quot; a sum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I explain to them the sum@@ ming , that I am persu@@ aded by writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does them . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- as I began to work and to work and to work and to work , to create , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ ming , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the sum@@ ming is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you can &apos;t strive other than size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more crowded boundaries , the more work there are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love working , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming . &quot;
I like this sum@@ ming . I love the sum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I only this sum ?
and then the sum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out . &quot;
the sum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single employer .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; Cookies , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ ming ceased . &quot;
the tot@@ als of the engine st@@ rolled .
I didn &apos;t really love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ ming did not come back .
my sum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sl@@ um@@ ber doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
&quot; I was a show @-@ titanium , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ ming and sum@@ ming I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; how@@ l yourself , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you are doing it , you love what you are doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one to the sum if you already knew the bu@@ zz when the sum@@ ming stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late and she says : &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; Cookies . &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I hate it when I am Titan , and I &apos;m smoking , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; so she says : &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; we play and their sisters meet , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can do nothing but watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ is@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it dies , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that is not right away , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ ming slowly comes back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let us remain in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working environment , the title transmitter , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the aid of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how dys@@ functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real tot@@ als depend on love .
&quot; the sum is the current , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignored by the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ ming is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no other choice , unless I want to hear the sums . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not enough to me as to how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person does better than to be at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , me . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we are moving around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst with soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always tend to my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever listened to the games ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes away .
&quot; my little ones don &apos;t want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and talks my teen @-@ daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
everyone can take 15 minutes at the piece even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes at the piece !
&quot; no mobile , no clothes , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children ready to bed . &quot;
but 15 minutes are possible !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for his peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I quit when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes at the piece why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums then seem to return if I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for this . &quot;
it &apos;s snow@@ ing to me that I am a titanium . I have never seen a Titan who plays the journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ ming , the more this unusual , engaging , naked and new life feeling in me is wide . less titanium -- more me ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;m thinking you &apos;re living . &quot;
&quot; that belongs to the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a crash . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
&quot; they have certainly heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one impl@@ ements a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the ne@@ ural circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain oscill@@ ates the brain and the skull pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen cereb@@ ral mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to prosp@@ er . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François made it . &quot;
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the study of biology , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingual area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ registered it at the extraction point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist Transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ inv@@ ent these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ re @-@ inv@@ ests the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we re @-@ registered the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were taken out again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we added an injury to and re @-@ reported exactly the same cells and now the cells survived -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re @-@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkey with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills area in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; ther@@ eup@@ on the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it happened in people , they spontan@@ eously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left side you see the monkeys that spontan@@ eously re@@ juven@@ ate .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we re @-@ inv@@ oked the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in the human being .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can take this . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to select the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
you have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable mer@@ it .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved dou@@ bt@@ less that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; indeed , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally declar@@ ing that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs , which were realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit &quot; &quot; parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt hill that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt , &quot;
but only a few see his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy austerity and corporations that are too timi@@ d to invest it there where it would be productive and produce income with which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro zone , in all the well @-@ being of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rails , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.4 tril@@ lion sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchanges infl@@ ate and the real estate prices up@@ lift . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops , which are not equ@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand that would support the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally brought about the circumstances that lead him to k@@ ills him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
&quot; Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society , in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government . &quot;
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive part of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voice weigh@@ ting in questions of the public body . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible , as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our today &apos;s democr@@ acies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two , and the economy gradually under@@ went politics and created them . &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics is mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is in such a way as a flock of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably under@@ min@@ ed the animals from which they nour@@ ished , that they end up star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has tou@@ red politics so far that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the general economic demand falls and the corporate executives are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin @-@ peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robot .
&quot; the problem here is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin @-@ peaks is higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , just as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance @-@ hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve the human being , or to indul@@ ge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what should it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all short , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which one ear@@ ns money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all the income derived from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour have been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no differentiation between those who belong to the company but do not work in it , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong . no exchange rate between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin @-@ tops . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and any government pays the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is invested in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is simultaneously liber@@ ally in which it pre@@ fers privileged individuals , and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the rub@@ b@@ ish of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we not do so , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is absolutely relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you are not confused you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in certain respects , if I may say this as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells enormous according to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the ongoing den@@ ial that a massive blood@@ shed by the euro@@ zone proce@@ eded , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , still chose den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to preserve an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change its constitution . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions going through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they conducted a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , stood up : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tide of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; because if it does not survive , the liber@@ ated centri@@ sts will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post@@ modern 1930 what it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you that you were with TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most , although he probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy has hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard cont@@ ested industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are right on this corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website , which displays the rating from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review . &quot;
&quot; will your show be rated at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; they are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to submit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts of the average exc@@ itation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not enth@@ use . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon &apos;s doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and pic@@ ks up eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where everyone can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things in vain , do you get too , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for a super show and he also uses data for it , but it makes it a little different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , i.e. the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the pieces together they went a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data accomplished companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is a bit start@@ ling because we live in a time when we are going to take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the United States and asks for discharge , it is prob@@ able that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not . &quot;
&quot; just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most reversible companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news broadcast . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year by year until suddenly it was no longer working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even the data of the most reversible companies , such as Amazon and Google , sometimes mis@@ understand . &quot;
&quot; despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been capable of . but the decision , how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compet@@ ed for TV ideas than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; this is what the data say to us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will test it later with a test demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ spect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you of course know when you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
