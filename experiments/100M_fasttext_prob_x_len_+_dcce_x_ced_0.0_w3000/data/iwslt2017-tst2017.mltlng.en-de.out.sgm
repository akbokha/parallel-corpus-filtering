<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that NSA had listened to illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if this sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not liked the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has decided against crack and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this move, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistle-blowers and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Amendment of the Constitution, the media has the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something exceptional happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can still hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and risking to make statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, got his phone numbers secretly,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit, and even travel information with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and fissures."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has more condemns than all US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of a whistle-blowers who went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on them all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can do so from the moment in which they contact, rather than in hindsight, in witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that has not yet been written, when tears have written its book, and it is much safer than regular email or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source distribution system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and today was developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just like with any standard contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">They are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain more information, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to make sure that not only technology separators such as Edward Snowden have a chance to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers and report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental colleague, who suggests the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leak of history was published.] [the Panama Papers "reveal that rich and powerful] have hidden [huge sums of money in tax havens] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and attorneys go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of $2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, over a narrow friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agency killer or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret control oases are used by some few, to hide and obscure their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are less reports on this issue in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were so far no prominent Americans who came in these revelations this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now it is not that there are no rich Americans, who hide their fortunes in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens function, Moselle Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, you need less information in some US states to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children off.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 Bar Companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all up to one lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we have to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very gloomily, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite a lot of things to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen precedents for more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme was political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers at a national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see such Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who become angry when they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the transparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he said he would go to the Corps of Peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to end up in the boot of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," uh, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," Oh dear! "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger slumps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, embarrassed at tithes to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood, actually friends who just waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we take a time leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plagued, my roommate is pulled out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe creativity can create it, to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate, Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and breakfast each morning. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure, our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stopped."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented to the investors:" "we want to create a site where people share public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can invite other people to stay overnight."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you don't mind the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked cell phone to your left sitting roommates.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent plough of panic, which you feel right now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel like they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only once, who is actually Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he candifies for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name, if he had told how he came from, how his dog or his children were called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 reviews, all of them say," "He can hold really well unlocked phones!" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to hand off your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to dismiss negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's call -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation sticks out similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" "Hi!", "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"as for example," I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Tolle art works in your apartment!"</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put aside these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly: a need, which was previously uncovered."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who unallowed parties to celebrate parties or ravaged flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at front of the front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million booked nights had ever been a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust one another at law.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, something wonderful can occur."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to be heart inflow due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is going on."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a commercial trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is simply to call the" "Rental industry", "the thing is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, this is comparable to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"however, what if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you are visiting, a group would be eager to fill a thoroughly and show you a neighborhood where you have never heard of it;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces owned by the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children were pulled out. incubator programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has it just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about it when a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"we know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for the future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay in the check-up at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: Americans mean, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">"probably, people don't talk about their Uber drivers."</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual muscle.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old, I was able to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wasted the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you, fully understands you, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people ran out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock soon turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists,..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "" "came down..." "... jihad...,..." "bombs Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how to wander -- as we rode silently -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be alert, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Don't be sampled. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday that week, the day when Muslims gathered for prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings heard," "Don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslims, dragged and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the US but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, helpers and Olympus."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques of America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there might be a few parking spaces free, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque leads to a more tolerant people in other beliefs and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of the radicalisation process one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves to the world of creation, when one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "sacred book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom they spoke, brought them to silence, and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had made sense of their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and His church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept in mind to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you submit news reports in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood strikes against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public, to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the allocation of collective innocence, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when has I become such an accomplished young man from my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, had assassinated them, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He spent eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be fatal not only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we talked about it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that we can control ourselves by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at that moment, I have collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and sympathy of panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I ask myself, what do you say to those who might claim that you are a TEDTalk, a mentor with draught are working in a noble think tank, so an exception and not the rule."</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">"Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive. I am totally normal."</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is shortly before becoming a millionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air parcels rush into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting each other, flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors, in order to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starter drives, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind-buds.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often present basic abstract questions which can become the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago trained pilot operated flight devices could fly away, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a rear wheel."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplistic remote controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-ruder, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, in the interior life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move across in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in seclusion, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"in this way, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is shot or even rotating."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things can be illustrated in models, the rest is learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if planes should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however something goes wrong -- a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-copter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"the particularly safe machine, on Broadway, would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"about 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes were circling around each other in a very distant galaxy, so they transformed the mass of three suns in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"this short moment, they lit more brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"first of all, we arrange the events in a timely manner."</seg>
<seg id="476">"a total of 1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life on Earth was created."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is up to us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which could be caused by collizing black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is now called Advanced Ligo."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, Ligo was started for a final test run to clarify some small, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, just a few days after commissioning the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collizing black holes penetrated through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in essence, it was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crimping in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched into one direction and gestures into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often give a really alberty dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and digested at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured precisely to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the waves as follows:" technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because in this way you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the lights coming around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in killing, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just say Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob disrupts her." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dumb Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot easily create images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we turn wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, can tell us about the collision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"sh: two black, non-rotating holes, just run: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"the two bodies turn very quickly, you hear the same pie with an additional sound change. this sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement of movement, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo: [Surrender sound] Somebody who knows what he has to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sunscreen that rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, rotates a hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes happen at the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is covered by its own night lights."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back at the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first run things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watched them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year, I would say" yes! "I was afraid of which I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly that, I was afraid, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes," "has changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected. it started with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the Smallest, calls all" "cookies" "for inexplicable reasons."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"cookies, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on I swear to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" saga for playing with my kids saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things are awaking up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Porn-Movie with SexySamira</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Porn-Movie with SexySamira</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do watch TV, in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days of four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that are simultaneously in production, times four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, which burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who's doing this yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Porn-Movie with SexySamira</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work so that you can understand that I don't just walk around on the computer and it's true, when I say, I understand that it's not about dreaming about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I get into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it's when I set up troops, when I painted on a screen."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so when you make a high sound, run a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a summing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I explain to them the summing, that I am persuaded by writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that does them."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- as I began to work and to work and to work and to work, to create, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this summing, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The summing is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The summing is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you can't strive other than size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the summing."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a titanium, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more crowded boundaries, the more work there are, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love working, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the summing, the summing, the summing."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this summing. I love the summing.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the summing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The summing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mother is a single employer.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum won't be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," "Cookies, I want to go to Shonda-Land." ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the summing ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The totals of the engine strolled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't really love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The summing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My summing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no regret, nothing delegate, a titanium slumber doesn't give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-titanium,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the summing and summing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" howl yourself, stupid author-Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you are doing it, you love what you are doing to be a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one to the sum if you already knew the buzz when the summing stops, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late and she says:" "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" Cookies. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I am Titan, and I'm smoking, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"so she says:" "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters meet, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of summing, I can do nothing but watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it dies, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not right away, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The summing slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sum, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the title transmitter, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the aid of broadcasts and TV hours and how dysfunctional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real totals depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sum is the current, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">Real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignored by the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real summing is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no other choice, unless I want to hear the sums."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not enough to me as to how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what a person does better than to be at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, me."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we are moving around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst with soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always tend to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever listened to the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me naive, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes away.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones don't want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talks my teen-daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more does not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes at the piece even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no clothes, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children ready to bed."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz, to have a place for his peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I quit when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes at the piece why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums then seem to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the humming, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so grateful for this."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing to me that I am a titanium. I have never seen a Titan who plays the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the summing."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this summing, the more this unusual, engaging, naked and new life feeling in me is wide. less titanium -- more me!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I'm a writer. I think things out, I'm thinking you're living."</seg>
<seg id="789">"that belongs to the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a crash."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they have certainly heard of one of the most well-known, the" deep brain stimulation. "in doing so, one implements a electrode deep in the brain to influence the neural circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain oscillates the brain and the skull pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen cerebral mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to prosper."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François made it."</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the study of biology, that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-lingual area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-registered it at the extraction point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-invent these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-re-invests the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we re-registered the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were taken out again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we added an injury to and re-reported exactly the same cells and now the cells survived -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkey with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor skills area in the motoric cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it happened in people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkeys that spontaneously rejuvenate.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we re-invoked the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in the human being.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can take this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to select the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable merit.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved doubtless that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy disappears with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally declaring that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programs, which were realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are blamed, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit" "paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt hill that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few see his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy austerity and corporations that are too timid to invest it there where it would be productive and produce income with which it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the euro zone, in all the well-being of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rails, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the $5,1 trillion, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchanges inflate and the real estate prices uplift."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin-tops, which are not equated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low aggregate demand that would support the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally brought about the circumstances that lead him to kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">"Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society, in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government."</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive part of the Athenian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voice weighting in questions of the public body."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very bright, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible, as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our today's democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two, and the economy gradually underwent politics and created them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics is migrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is in such a way as a flock of predators that sustainably undermined the animals from which they nourished, that they end up starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has toured politics so far that it harms itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the inequality rises, the general economic demand falls and the corporate executives are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin-peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy back together, and it would be better if the" Demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem here is, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twin-peaks is higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance-hyperautocracy that makes the film" matrix "appear as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" matrix, "or something similar to the society in" Star Trek, "in which machines serve the human being, or to indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long discussions the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what should it look like to have this "Star Trek" utopia instead of the "matrix" like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, in all short, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market in which one earns money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one company to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all the income derived from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage labour have been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no differentiation between those who belong to the company but do not work in it, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong. no exchange rate between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no towering twin-tops."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly introduce that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and any government pays the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is invested in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially against the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is simultaneously liberally in which it prefers privileged individuals, and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the rubbish of history, and Keynesian, globally keynesianically."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we not do so, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as a" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is absolutely relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not confused you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays, -- the sphere of economy -- is a totally democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in certain respects, if I may say this as provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells enormous according to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to the complacency, and the ongoing denial that a massive bloodshed by the eurozone proceeded, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, still chose denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to preserve an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authoritarianism in life, it may be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future, if we do not change its constitution."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions going through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they conducted a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"it is worse than during the" "Great Depression". ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, stood up:" that was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tide of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"because if it does not survive, the liberated centrists will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a postmodern 1930 what it appears to me, it will also be unbearable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you that you were with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard most, although he probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy has hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes herself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard contested industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website, which displays the rating from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be rated at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"they are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to submit" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts of the average excitation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not enthuse."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it's the first time Amazon's doing something so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and picks up eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where everyone can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things in vain, do you get too, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US senators. ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for a super show and he also uses data for it, but it makes it a little different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, i.e. the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the pieces together they went a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data accomplished companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, this is a bit startling because we live in a time when we are going to take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the United States and asks for discharge, it is probable that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most reversible companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news broadcast. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year around year by year until suddenly it was no longer working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">"even the data of the most reversible companies, such as Amazon and Google, sometimes misunderstand."</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been capable of. but the decision, how to take all these parts, put together again and make a show like" House of Cards, "which was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas than they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "this is what the data say to us."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly probable" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will test it later with a test demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know when you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
