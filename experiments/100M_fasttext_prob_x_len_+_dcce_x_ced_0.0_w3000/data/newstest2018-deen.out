Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt , where young people should meet today . &quot;
a cryp@@ t which is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
Klein@@ g@@ är@@ tner manage the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official card Mün@@ chen encourages exciting stories to day .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; everyone knows that , because the car @-@ nav@@ i instead of a b@@ ypass road showed a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria in the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
&quot; the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet , which one does not recognize as such . &quot;
&quot; in the large picture card , more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original composition &quot; , &quot; were incorporated into cities and communities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing management between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville came off from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 56 , the original composition sheet for Munich origin@@ ates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like any other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek . &quot;
the comparison early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , so 1877 , as part of the Munich city district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming appears a small @-@ propor@@ tioned card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered bottles from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; , &quot; from which the corn@@ erst@@ one was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots today show no more farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , actually was a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the current district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; am Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once closed people with ins@@ anity . &quot;
&quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients first there was space , later on 500 places were extended . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum in Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people now meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich . &quot;
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it to a youth shelter with educational establishments .
&quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architectural ren@@ unciation of the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ al Institute , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main place &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies ris@@ ked a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a v@@ ault chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ enhof where this day was the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn trunk road . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
citizen Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to Promot@@ e Far@@ oe has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in the whole state and be noted here , &quot; it says in the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are hal@@ ted or killed because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s office , which is shown that black drivers in the state will be held 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be ready , whether they bring potential money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which rank the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company due to housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued a travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view on other racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
be@@ dez@@ v@@ ous project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U parliam@@ ent@@ arians Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac got a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ Location Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members at the right @-@ grab@@ bing of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first gave insights into his operation , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 deci@@ du@@ ous cows and also many young k@@ itt@@ ens and accommod@@ ated in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste is exclusively regional .
&quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV Chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ projekt as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably operate on such a steep terrain .
&quot; the green space care for a lot of work , much has to be mach@@ ined with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he did not perform a bio@@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the significance of the fence project and is glad about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers must be supported . &quot;
we hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and wor@@ rying about how they continue their business , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often in criticism because of their encour@@ agement .
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area is 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of € 71 500 , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter contributed to the community of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; stated Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives . &quot;
also for Peter white stood firm : &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Directory ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art support of f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest .
the presence of a conveyor belt designated by the L@@ PR is required .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area must not be tow@@ ed ( slope incl@@ ine over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , who want to build a fence around 16 kilometres , are currently running for the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ projekt 2018 . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ t@@ orium is equivalent to 35 hectares , which costs more than € 112 million . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate these as well as any other , therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the president for dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of land@@ owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have sm@@ iled him if he had done it .
&quot; but he picked up their meaning , and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta described , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , to which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the vibr@@ ating words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only inv@@ ade any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your afflic@@ ted masses , who are longing to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable gar@@ bage of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; smiling waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death - knew very well that they had accomplished a highly @-@ political act .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classical depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus changes this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change this for a long time from the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not invited , but rather an early neo@@ conservative , which brings the American flame into the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not be enligh@@ tened by the way to the United States .
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ usive but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the ships of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch is not to ligh@@ ten the path , but to ign@@ ite the hatred which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ dges Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the United Kingdom &apos;s team
&quot; the power director of the United Kingdom &apos;s Athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black says , that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alli@@ sts , who will compete in their fifth world champ@@ ionships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 cat@@ ar@@ acts are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the high @-@ speed runner Mu@@ ir is on this road and has five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another gr@@ otto that one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; being special about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me , it makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to go to Po@@ dium . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block@@ age of critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the local voters .
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from the domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sli@@ pped in criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led to slaughter like sheep . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people , who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , therefore , compl@@ ained him at the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the Gover@@ nor Staff dism@@ issed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type such as H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary H@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rig@@ orous adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his elec@@ tors and to play his ha@@ iry head for chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ ess spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people , which vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t value this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are ignored by some rather than so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the staff of the governor called &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or delete a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same , that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical material items and to arrest and silence prot@@ esters . &quot;
but exactly this is happening digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect as the internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied in between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters sm@@ ashed on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , critic@@ ised by the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his post , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not put them to silence .
freedom of speech and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for home comfort during the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field left up to the final round before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as tournament sp@@ ies on behalf of the club founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he has won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not have to defend the Extrem@@ ad@@ ura Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot;
to come back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on homeland . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how it went so far .
&quot; the Trio in the field is the former champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
fewer pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer deaths due to passive smoking
&quot; in the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists at the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths per year are attribut@@ able to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 cases of lung cancer deaths per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hide in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is often hin@@ dered by construction work , represents a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of motor@@ ists in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; &quot; explains Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red bul@@ b is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as clothes with cloudy water from the nearby mar@@ sh . &quot;
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , she was not assigned any fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which applied for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the Province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is deser@@ ted . the journey involves a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrug@@ ated roofs , which have been converted into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indonesian people made their journey here , for journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans became a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; previously , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort is worth $ 3.1 billion gold and copper . &quot;
Pap@@ ua also has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military and units almost 20 million US dollars from 1998 to 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ads and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to reports of activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands were rap@@ ed and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970s , according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal lands have been cited as genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; says it in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ anese War@@ ning cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting to stop here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who went to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the indigenous Pap@@ ua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Pap@@ ua during his 2014 campaign . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the natives feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers was imp@@ ending their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le but@@ t , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby governmental commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting questionn@@ aires and carried the Wa@@ ita dance -@@ in a circle and mim@@ ic a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters started throwing stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TIME document that was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly poured into my left wrist , &quot; he said , TIME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and looked at his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only carries a name like many Indonesian , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the Che@@ fin@@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station only because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ is@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings took place only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks later , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Minister of security , Wir@@ anto , said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism to con@@ serve historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto was a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta , and said he has no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; accused of crimes against humanity committed by the UN for crimes against humanity , claimed that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Pap@@ ua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ing dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that Pan@@ i@@ ai people are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police f@@ lowed on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others died , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location office .
the police said that vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly here , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have two days hidden in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the police brig@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a bar@@ rage of the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by cont@@ acting spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and were arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty increases dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to process four or five fields of sweet potato .
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
&quot; Pap@@ ua rarely has capital or the necessary skills , in order to maintain its own businesses competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media are ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were depor@@ ted from Pap@@ ua due to lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permission to film was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign , the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ even eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ using and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific countries called T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ers . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM supported .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ victims led a last symbolic act of dis@@ belief : the victims of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire occurred in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which in just two years swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scr@@ aper , which is acci@@ dentally called the tor@@ ch tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; said an inhabit@@ ant who attacked his name as George , Reuters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions concerning the safety of materials used in the field of high @-@ rise buildings across the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from facing , outer covering for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of an industry in which around 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal to play Davis Cup singles was only supported by two profit sets for this sport , not spar@@ sely supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; these are often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics will be preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was simply missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; after many contradictions , the proposal had already come before the proposal to leave the final on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 is only compar@@ atively small details : in the next round , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the cost of the organis@@ er , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;

&quot; the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gled goods by airport security , and how many had inten@@ tionally done it . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear sm@@ ug@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through safety , those who fly most often . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the greatest amount of items conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;

El@@ on Mus@@ k does not matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far lined that a part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la Chief El@@ on Mus@@ k announced another , less brilliant figure when announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly assessment : the cancell@@ ations made in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k has often been recru@@ iting with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k adm@@ its : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US Dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations require a telephone conference with analysts at a telephone conference . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; 2018 - all models will be put together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; should expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , never in practice tested production roads without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from being able to run away in pairs . &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt returns to reducing emissions because of the rel@@ uc@@ tance of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
&quot; one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more respon@@ sive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
&quot; he did not mention the complaint , which had been raised against his previous job in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al . &quot;
it is a period that went down on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone .
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly tried to block or delay regul@@ ating the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administration exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA often has not adher@@ ed to the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then to be accused of being accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s opinion that P@@ ru@@ itt at some point will use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full @-@ powers &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive review of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not set to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their congregations , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smoke can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributes to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists appl@@ au@@ ded P@@ ru@@ itts &apos;s surprising course changes .
&quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government , to address environmental poll@@ uters and their particular interests . &quot;
tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche , on the occasion of the anniversary of the church church , on Sunday , July 16 , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. a seren@@ ade is invited . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ ingen a concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique rural treasure . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische prono@@ unc@@ ements : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document of the document , on the Tum@@ our mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a glorious courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ al law belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glorious settlement nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 are under@@ lined by these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ ement was made up of the early medieval ap@@ titude .
&quot; a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two sh@@ attered at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded in 16@@ 92 for the first time , but later it had to be released in 1942 during the Second World War . &quot;
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were cut and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aky .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
&quot; they removed the pul@@ pit and church @-@ mill , and used it as fire@@ wood . &quot;
remains of the church threatened 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ary Church broke off .
only the bell tower was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the bell tower and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
only the existing tower @-@ room today survived as a witness to the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant as successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the promot@@ er invite friends and sponsors Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the Six@@ th Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ary Chapel . &quot;
this is arranged by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local pres@@ enter Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the for@@ e@@ word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers exhibit fantastic views . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organisers hope for many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance to tum@@ ors and listeners . &quot;
friends and suppor@@ ter tum@@ bl@@ ers feel particularly committed to home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to have permission from wind turbines
&quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Council of the Council . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; has asked Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
( detect automatically ) ut@@ f @-@ 8 ( Uni@@ code )
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city boundary to Schwal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone existed . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a mold failure . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval certificate remains un@@ lawful and therefore also decl@@ ining , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : the City Council once again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding writings have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , plans to build four four @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , which took part in the city of Vier@@ sen , had closed the lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity requirement of all four @-@ sen@@ er households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , the City Council gave its green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies with terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was wounded .
two further persons were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch traveled with her passenger car as accompanying person with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the commercial trial and municipal authorities intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to attract the residents to the city centre .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ tise customers to what offers the own town holds apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the downtown will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action does not only aim at residents of the city and the closer region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation for commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags indicating the weekend , Christian King . &quot;
the Municipal Auth@@ orities and War@@ eh@@ ouses Collabor@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; in this way , the trade @-@ commerce and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; attrac@@ tiveness of the city . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ fest and sal@@ eable Sunday , talks with all the professionals and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ developed . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , guests and tourists belong . &quot;
but also many locals had lost the city center while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ating the city center - to land@@ lords , the enterprises of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it l@@ acked to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly broad@@ ened , had said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen informed that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , the first five Thuring@@ ian cities , took part in the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. City of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire brig@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a person died when a part of a school building was collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing one was later also found dead .
the dead were the cler@@ ks of the school .
&quot; as an accident , the authorities suspected of working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people were staying in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump transl@@ ates after tran@@ scri@@ bed tran@@ scripts from telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scri@@ ptions by phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January Tr@@ ump launched a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President compl@@ ained him because he publicly deno@@ unced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and to leave Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scri@@ ptions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and unveiled a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States emig@@ rated to take over &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that has been convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull . &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist ly@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ bled to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a needle strip - took a long train at his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside ho@@ vering the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es torn the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was just a post . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost all in the audience sti@@ ff a real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civil rights activists come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been laugh@@ ed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was ever indic@@ ted for murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps in the organisation of post @-@ creation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the State Georgia and a lifetime of citizens .
&quot; for him , the demand serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that a injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must preserve justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we maintain justice .
a court physician places a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding gra@@ ves were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but none of them was ever indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the open foot for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision enabled the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ole according to the FBI the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried , did not come from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual follow @-@ up of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de for almost a decade .
&quot; their representation is clear , gri@@ pping , and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many believe that it no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look at , but Gre@@ ene said that it &apos;s the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching , because we are confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened to a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here a co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief of the clan member for years , but he said that the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and asks him to be angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- He , van@@ ish of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona re@@ jects the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; we@@ ather@@ ed one of the other black actors . &quot;
you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy trying to get this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene once again begins .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition is violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , k@@ is@@ ses and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from his eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the street . &quot;
they have experienced almost eight hours of intense humidity when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ers took place , the air feels donated . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken in their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; said a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ ord and wi@@ pe out their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man who played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow players and then breaks in their arms and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience will sit together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats about the post @-@ creation with a black couple that they just got to know . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words which feel the performance left behind .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and who do that , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone &apos;s court keeps Broo@@ ks court at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of citizens &apos; rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ creation is inspiring in a sense , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf puts on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e staging in front of gigantic , six @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed scenery . &quot;
&quot; Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) presents either a sh@@ ady street corner , including a Wall rem@@ nant and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before this , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ k@@ ills pose as rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs guiding motive - money , power and gre@@ ed - which pul@@ ls through its &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three songs of the Rhine - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;

later she has to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; stor@@ my are Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski who is humble and form@@ ulating their hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there are great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual recreational clothing . &quot;
the show was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his director .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a rolling pipe concert over himself , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing , in which the single &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ chat@@ es@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed this .
&quot; you realize that the audience has grown up with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said just before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding for its view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunte@@ ering year .
where is it all ?
&quot; crowd : normally in Stein@@ furt at the furniture exchange , once a week , I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I already worked at school in the open whole day .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ working volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a building engineer , we say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; I knew for myself , that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
&quot; do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at focal point perhaps also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where one makes his FS@@ J .
one can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon support . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing that mat@@ ured me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .

&quot; lot : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ ati@@ ks . &quot;
there are always other people who have a different story behind each other .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;
Pear@@ son k@@ ills more 3.000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ ten their interim divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressures that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , which had already lost 4,000 jobs , the breakdown of jobs , the general manager John Fall@@ on , mainly came to an end in 2018 and early 2019 . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced plans for a cost reduction plan for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after having achieved an increase of 1 percent to € 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack from Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul in Afghanistan , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say civil servants . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , deno@@ unced an explanation of Nato . &quot;
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at . &quot;
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to be attacked as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and be treated at the US military hospital on the Bag@@ ram Air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the Group , known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the force under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump has weak@@ ened , the number of US troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and in particular in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns a decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. environmental protection authority has a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that states are committed to cur@@ b smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states accused the Agency for the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone rules 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said that it will show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which parts of the country have to be measured in order to adhere to stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed an accus@@ ation on Tuesday and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that will boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA states that the inhal@@ ing of air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and improve respiratory symptoms such as as@@ thma . &quot;
municipal Council wants community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln decides to set up a common space in the future sen@@ iors residential community . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take until the area belonging to the church community is in municipal ownership , but there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ vering such a common space not as a meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ical living , but openly in the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget is already decided last autumn by means of funding .
the construction is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution is to signal the investor , that in this regard it is not possible to throw a cri@@ pple between the legs , the finding that both the saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding area - as well as mono @-@ roof - which reduces the lifting height and makes the construction more economical - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer is the addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he happens to the body .
not that easy is the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many own buildings that you don &apos;t get so much forward , but now you lean back in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard doing this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger refers to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area there is no allowance , but gives a real , in doubt , market@@ able counter@@ value , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to submit the proposal accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; this is the case with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we touch the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and was seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way from the road Schwar@@ zer towards Hil@@ den on the cycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder rode on the road , he obviously didn &apos;t pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a tar@@ pau@@ lin .
FC Bayern Munich must ref@@ rain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first time in the new season . &quot;
seven pro@@ s are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the winner of the cup .
personnel worries at German football record champ@@ ions Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ cal Win@@ ner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to disp@@ ense with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Mr. Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has created the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said , &quot; The most important point is balance within the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official duty match of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
w@@ ander in the resin of star to star
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this plans the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; meets the need for information of many visitors , called it . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic achievement . &quot;
members want to display panels along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; easily accessible installations in five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; enquiry to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables is to be added to the internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the path to the con@@ stellation is to be expanded by train . &quot;
&quot; on the path of the star , the viewer experience a lot of knowledge , for example , about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ aire than another even though it is much far@@ ther away . &quot;
&quot; in which con@@ stellation is a selected star , and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; in the university city , since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star @-@ wer@@ g - the planet &apos;s road since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ es leads up to the Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( village gli@@ des ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Pl@@ uto de@@ mot@@ ed Pl@@ uto at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , measuring 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the Plan@@ etary Path is approximately four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from the sun to the Pl@@ uto takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Pl@@ uto . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
&quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would take half a year . &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were supposed to stand in a coll@@ ision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super Sus@@ pen@@ se Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How is it to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former feather weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia rec@@ alled . &quot;
&quot; I have risen to Bron@@ zes &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Yan@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all the fans asked after him , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he considers Lom@@ ach@@ enko as an &quot; &quot; enormous fighter &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous compli@@ ment to Gar@@ cia and said he would like to see the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ verside &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show punch strength , then boxing . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
this is the battle to be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; said Lom@@ ach@@ enko : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded on tyre tra@@ ys
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira had lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car drag@@ ged to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stre@@ ak . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service A7 towards the north was closed for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site . &quot;
&quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; tri@@ k@@ ette works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener , Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the optimization of the defense formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season game Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , there were not the two counter@@ parts at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two counter@@ parts too much , and we have to go even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ cycle should also be further optimised . &quot;
and a fool will no longer want to catch up with the For@@ tun@@ en .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no one next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also get better after the experience in preparation with the tri@@ pled ette , than with the qu@@ at@@ tire . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; because we have just in the tri@@ pl@@ ette on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann , who can build well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not do so many ab@@ norm@@ alities in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can speak about an un@@ decided start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are standing on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; the start of the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who did not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they don &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una versus an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland see as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we are swe@@ eping away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine matches . &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant .
and so Funk@@ el wants to not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ based application tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the Asyl@@ um process , they should take a closer look at the age assessment after the Swedish Migration Office ( Migration Committee ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; up to now , migration has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly less than 18 years old . &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the under@@ stated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ adet susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 results , she stated that in 243 these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , when x @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work involves ass@@ essing the biological maturity of men to see if they were sooner or later than usually passed through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safe , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case this is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ strasse 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of the Department of Road Management and Transport in the Pres@@ idential department of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 m . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy , so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the northern side . &quot;
&quot; this is a boundary fixing , which is also used as operating path . &quot;
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 20 @-@ metre wide bridge cap should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will take place .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger @-@ cent@@ ur@@ ism has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans first had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ les amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German Pot@@ ato Sal@@ ad
&quot; it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties are pulling in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell to &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D people , but rather demonstrate . &quot;
the Eifel remains colorful .
&quot; originally the city picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , really rejo@@ iced : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could easily eat the Af@@ D &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel . he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 listeners in the audi@@ t@@ orium , who wait for the candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is to be announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ Concer@@ ts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian pianist Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and lau@@ re@@ ates of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter , at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , is the solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both combines the desire to transc@@ end not only the limits on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz ech@@ op@@ rei@@ ra N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall art work . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was premier@@ ed only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously incorporated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I join grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relation of Hollywood stars was her &quot; &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately fell apart . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I have been . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I had played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed in it seriously . &quot;
so I never got confused or obstruc@@ ted me .
I just never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; especially among them , she said , &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time when she dressed like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a inhabit@@ ant of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes finds out that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us than working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for D@@ oping sc@@ andal &quot;
&quot; the world leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again in sport . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said he was sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were str@@ apped off in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF will vote for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e to the repor@@ ter . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia again , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete at the World Athle@@ tics World Championships , which will start on Friday in London following the rig@@ orous IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; while drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free , he told repor@@ ters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
O@@ bit@@ u@@ ar@@ act for soldiers tr@@ unc@@ ated in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ischen Fr@@ itz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two soldiers have been thinking about the soldiers in a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
&quot; the Minister of Defense , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; benef@@ actors of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
&quot; her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany , and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter . &quot;
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took their leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German armed forces and politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the members of the family stood by arm in arm . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defense of the Ley@@ en described the reverse soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and dri@@ fted . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the flight operation of the fight @-@ helicopter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody could have mo@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en , did not show that the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; for a country , of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife . &quot;
that divided the king &apos;s house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
&quot; the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said further in the announcement . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still uncle@@ ar .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the hei@@ r of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to reign . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also lays down the title &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ gem@@ ahl &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik had not received the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately , be still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristocr@@ acy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik has been critic@@ ised for the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised .
&quot; my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , however , he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
that said Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Green MPs from their parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover was losing its short@@ cut One @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Country Day , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern it in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Diet decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament dism@@ is@@ ses the trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be checked in a legally clean way , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; in peace , all questions will be discussed if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it distinguished itself as a tra@@ ilers of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the dism@@ iss@@ al de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country parliament .
&quot; we naturally assume that they have received their country trade , which they have received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; the President of Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner shared . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen extra@@ ordinarily . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I consciously decided not to lead a pr@@ on@@ unciation in the faction . &quot;
&quot; even against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition from Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the attitude of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the parliament .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in their last vanity and in their fru@@ stration , the politicians place their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed the Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is taking this dirty intri@@ gu@@ ing game and tries to beat political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U @-@ frac@@ tional leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler will recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 country election with personal career gifts . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the most powerful force , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens , but a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ases , Mr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
how can consumers protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di is taking the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since disclosure . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as much concern as manufacturers ensure that the products sold are traffic @-@ capable and non @-@ hazardous to health .
&quot; if the back @-@ level salary of 0,@@ 00@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not bu@@ oy@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , production plants are not directly responsible . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , they have to reck@@ on with economic damages due to presum@@ ably illegal practice of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the case of appointments . &quot;
is it only missing on the staff or on the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that had un@@ covered the process .
&quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be received are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made clear several times that I expect a complete clari@@ fication from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and safe food .
&quot; when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; through pan@@ elling funds , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il in the attitude of food supplying animals is intoler@@ able and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
at all levels it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure .
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the facts are quickly and completely clari@@ fied .
how to Aff@@ ect Fis@@ cal Rules of Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ imp@@ eded issues of European football clubs , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to for@@ ge teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play Rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G will eventually prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money with certainty , so that N@@ ey@@ mar subscri@@ bes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may have a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but they must be subject to legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , following his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; former French players believed that clubs , who had put enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich , originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the pres@@ idency in Un@@ gn@@ ad , his UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the debt collection can be exp@@ ended for the next five years in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the hard@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to super@@ se@@ de their financial supervision by m@@ owing their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar on payments of the World Cup &apos;s Organ@@ izing Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar WM amb@@ ass@@ adors will be amb@@ ass@@ adors and will be easy to figure out such manoeu@@ v@@ res for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more alert to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with respect to Kat@@ ar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations from La Liga to a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because there are different ways , or can have different interests if a country has such a major actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss Life . &quot;
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and undergo a quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate panels of 14 grams , each year , distribute the flight att@@ endant before landing to the passengers . &quot;
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ der estimates the order volume in accordance with &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer , it is a prestigious order . &quot;
&quot; as many candidates give it to the new tender , Swiss will not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a statement . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with H@@ ug . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ g@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the vision@@ ary David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ ehler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ or ( it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking on the core of the g@@ ags - middle aged actors play cool children , who will grow up - yet they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grow@@ n@@ ups , who are now adults , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ ody divi@@ des more according to the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker Films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that sw@@ ells the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point rum@@ bles a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some insi@@ der sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the grac@@ ious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot in which Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as usual , the ex@@ positions are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ ons under lip of &quot; singles &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of acci@@ dental mad@@ ness that could kind@@ le this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeated &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; on Amazon now reminds of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; GLO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director adm@@ its of being a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV how Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is included - that it often plays like a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it draws away and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was credited to a lesser length could provide his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re better , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men , which dev@@ ours a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed a v@@ ow .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years old and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; the officials also secured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
two persons were arrested at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 police officers were employed . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , addic@@ ted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug trade in the southern German area . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning large @-@ scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Italian prosec@@ ut@@ ors returned to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner registry in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to partly serious mistakes in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , draws attention to large gaps in the immigration center register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there might result in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to partly serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; warned in an analysis of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship have been recorded in the register , among them some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; since the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 was found in individual cases , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics on paying people , citizens are also included in EU citizens who do not have to leave . &quot;
&quot; such er@@ ron@@ eous arrangements , however , led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with trav@@ ails , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously began sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they entered the country . &quot;
&quot; it emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is said that the BA@@ MF leads such procedures to families with children , except for babies and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this has been practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migrants are travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ated country . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the office is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy stayed for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) consider these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also send back refugees in the scope of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal spokes@@ person for the Left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights due to lack of acceptance in the Italian asylum system and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service to other people .
&quot; at least among the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; first of all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile distributed 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church pra@@ ises in the meeting of the council the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out for it , and we d@@ ant respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , even un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are divided into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; for example , three persons could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ators , &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the transition to the theatre house has led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were awarded for the multiple orders and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation on an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; sl@@ ug@@ g@@ ish &quot; &quot; when they contributed interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members in this month to increase , as weak economic growth weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue to rise to just below 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs could possibly rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package , issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , GDP ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to poll@@ ute consumption . &quot;
&quot; at interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool down inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; increases would take place . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the Bank towards the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor increases , as the sharp@@ ening becomes even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; prevent the income statement &quot; &quot; in the coming years , but added that the wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecast will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by rising demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote caused by the sin@@ king of the ground .
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until it will complete the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate was increasing , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has declined from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them over the next few months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the exceed@@ ance of 2 % is &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again because the len@@ ders are looking sil@@ ently for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those where the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages close , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be 10,000 people cont@@ enti@@ ous HIV drug &quot;
&quot; in September following a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ treatment pro@@ phyla@@ xis used before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now provided by healthcare through a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to make the registration of people possible , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
prevention pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicine taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medications may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well @-@ known due to anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted , taken and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said , &quot; This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted for vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards people with high HIV @-@ risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we hear@@ ti@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delayed and rel@@ uc@@ tant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , became a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I was looking for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne D@@ oom and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over one another , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative in order to solve the issue .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on each other , without having to push us . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; mirrors play a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all the cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special feature of this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so when you push the door , slide very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor area , and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you in electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself into something completely aston@@ ished by a good design and increased square meter .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an analysis of one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s biggest real estate empire worth more than $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation occurs in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers bought 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the West@@ co jeans founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as the main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; was described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in has the value of $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a direct issue for Paul .
&quot; the divisions suggested by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood properties , in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to give her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not wish that Paul and I would end in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; he said and added that he still hopes for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including reports on news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with leading employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to repair : bad information entering the president &apos;s hands . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by over@@ seeing its media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television last decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince him , &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit ever was &quot; under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets would have included even more ignition without their interventions .
we will probably never learn something about the twe@@ ets which Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his colleagues manage to stay away from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has consistently prevented it from calling trou@@ bling tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a white house , consisting of competing parties , try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material , which may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors , the president for strategic reasons , doub@@ ting information . &quot;
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with embarrass@@ ing le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where these originate . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ oc@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chic@@ anes , or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump las the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for . &quot;
the police throughout Europe are sending post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; as the addresses of the searched heavy criminals naturally are not known , evidence from the population is hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; advent calendar from the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting outlets were hiding on holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have put 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online Ges@@ u@@ chten could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them are based on the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aire Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands once again stand with a few resol@@ ute travellers on the military base , who have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn from the community to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ aire Series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without having been deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch made by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tak@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers .
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , were moved on and went back again . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect her parks . &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it .
&quot; a local resident , who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of those travelers just to be pill@@ aged by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to make them move as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents send an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling on 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
&quot; from Birk@@ enhof to &quot; &quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located . &quot;
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof , by the former Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH to 13 April 2014 , about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenue was lost due to the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who arrived in the administrative district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented asylum seek@@ ers from setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Municipal Council .
&quot; but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with manager Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof has been building construction sh@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance since a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; floors were torn out , ceilings are partially disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
&quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry dr@@ illed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the city &apos;s not@@ ions are the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he pays . &quot;
&quot; the outer complex@@ es are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us Special Represent@@ ative sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ ers Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury following a report . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the body has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to people familiar with it . &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
&quot; the broad@@ c@@ aster CN@@ N reported , there are already the initial charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps äl@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time , pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ed with in the 2016 presidential campaign . &quot;
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men should stand , who acted as advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Represent@@ ative Tr@@ ump has personally moved to the centre and under@@ mining the accus@@ ation whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affairs . &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to check the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Trial Cham@@ bers .
&quot; most of the time , they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the board can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to say that it was in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his wife @-@ in @-@ law Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also participated in the discussion . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that he should act quickly if necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up on the end to decide on the charging of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ dium was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he didn &apos;t know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; these work , however , usually work in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent on &quot; fair &quot; means .
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey stated three times that he would not be determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the declaration . &quot;
&quot; Mu@@ eller , however , had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this root , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he intended to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June , in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; following the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special agents and his collabor@@ ators . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to be released .
&quot; unlike an independent promot@@ er of Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the pres@@ idency of the President of the Justice Department . &quot;
&quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot;
&quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented legislative proposals on Thursday , after which the special issu@@ er could not be dism@@ issed so easily . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the scar@@ cely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin was solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
this was divided by the Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a tril@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large col@@ os@@ sus now travel to the north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , is uncle@@ ar according to research data . &quot;
&quot; however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of c@@ ud@@ dles in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ et background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it grows more and more into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies almost at the tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula south of South America .
&quot; North of this course , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ ort was dis@@ rupted a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen was dis@@ assembled there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn so far as currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point . &quot;
melting Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level since they float on the water and consume ice as much water as it results in melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small extent , the British research project writes for the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI information , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ biggest glacier in Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and has no direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , said Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers do not lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not to climate change , many c@@ ud@@ dle of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades . &quot;
this long tip of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends toward South America .
&quot; according to data from the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the iron surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the increase in temperature has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has been war@@ med by around three degrees in the past 50 years , thereby counting towards the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants home tari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ancies , the CD@@ U asks to leave the employer &apos;s association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the day of the circle experienced 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees now have their first working day behind them . &quot;
the teachers at the circle are obviously very popular .
some 620 applications were listed for the seats that were in vain this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for professionals , but to counter@@ act the forward @-@ looking of candidate short@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should focus on the inside and outside , show specific measures for cross @-@ entry and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees who have to leave hospital or age @-@ related illnesses result from the service . &quot;
&quot; maximum time for action , so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he had long since taken care of a big surprise in the day of the day , when he publicly challenged the costs of personnel and bl@@ oss@@ oms the remaining parties . &quot;
&quot; people want all the possibilities to be checked , which allow an exit from the communal employers association . &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should aim at a house rate , &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better to the employees and officials than the rate of collective bar@@ gaining is actually fores@@ een . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money exist only if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees will take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least because of the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team effectively worked with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which was in operation only for a year , refused to express himself in detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation .
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , which has been monitoring since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew accepts infl@@ atable migrants , which are delivered to them directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of being over@@ thrown over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all , have to board an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been ready to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring significant changes or disabilities to their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , was greatly reduced to the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with the local may@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest @-@ drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ undy and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed views , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , look@@ out at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ cked &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and st@@ ony hu@@ ts brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed in the air inhal@@ atorium cur@@ ative Sole .
also Neustadt was controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 al@@ timet@@ ers , the group had got to know the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - athle@@ tic and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga prepar@@ es for e @-@ sport
&quot; in the future , the sports stars will sit in front of computer consoles , rather than swe@@ ating through wind and weather over the stadium racing ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included . &quot;
&quot; this also has recognised the first federal lig@@ aver@@ a , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last@@ ly the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Board Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; that there are still some clubs going on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend the FIFA World Federation FIFA in London organizes the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven was qualified . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the former coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present in these markets online than once a year to send the federal union to Asia . &quot;
what is it about ?
&quot; in the e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just football @-@ simulation FIFA on the level of competition are fought . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since become established in which professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certain to be used . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ ler also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a subject . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the way internationally , which is like a large global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the company consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predicted rapid growth ahead of e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports bet@@ ting providers Uni@@ cr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe , too , some things are happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , &quot; says F@@ rob@@ atis . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first league clubs , according to Dut@@ t , are now oblig@@ ated to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , it is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t cling to it , that only when football is all the way it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter found guilty of the lyrics that Conrad Roy is forced to commit suicide
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy spoke on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .
&quot; she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions took Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said it was a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally regret . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; &quot; no day , in which I don &apos;t ro@@ b the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I am concerned with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never participate in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a aunt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person , with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent her in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is switch off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy &apos;s death , and ordered that she would benefit from any press . &quot;
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in Italy in 2007 for murder of her British ro@@ ommate before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the New Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm you .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , no Philipp L@@ ahm and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made himself divided into his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could interpret Kim@@ me as well .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s upcoming C @-@ El@@ f from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from the holiday . &quot;
&quot; sugar is usually distributed to those , of which one wants to keep a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in your mood . &quot;
&quot; those who were chosen to adopt the heritage of l@@ ame , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old acted as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field . &quot;
&quot; on the right rear , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ i worked in this start@@ formation like the one , who can take the helm best into his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( folded barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the devil , to join the services of the Asia journey ( also worked only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t , did not drop neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le went along with Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the defence , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli assault was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to win a few times in the building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the outcome was &quot; &quot; not as if we had hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance at the debut .

&quot; as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked after the game after the match . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs there were not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i adopted a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it often became irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V requests from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , president of the Association of Higher companies ( V@@ TU ) says , &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al is of course in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 will be the construction law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Minister of Transport . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to start the route in December 2020 , says Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in this , nat@@ us sees a sign for supporting regional , but international competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) stri@@ ves to produce a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label in the wine region , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since 10 years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing also has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master @-@ bonus an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the completed master exam and 2500 Euro , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of master training . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to create facts , at the same time it fails to provide the country with the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the BC@@ CI Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , 56 new engineers , who want to hire the Wis@@ sing at Landes@@ betrieb mobility , have only been vac@@ ant in 29 positions . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ spokes@@ person Christian Bald@@ auf refers to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the former broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the board of the wind turbine Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already cleared the field after four months due to dis@@ agreements . &quot;
&quot; Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in over 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to prohi@@ bit or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; nitrogen ox@@ ides , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases released by diesel vehicles , also take advantage of what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of spo@@ iling powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the problem of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called abra@@ sive devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen have been charged , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have a system installed to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the win of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Cr@@ oll@@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most widely published carto@@ on@@ ists , the rab@@ bits of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still works and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he found himself among other things as dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation , which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the end of the 60 &apos;s was the breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting at the table even today , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches continue to find its dro@@ oping figures worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - mur@@ der@@ less popular animal in his drawings - which has an exchange @-@ foot@@ er as an opponent . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema panel in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
&quot; that is why he rather sits on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced word@@ lessly . &quot;
lav@@ ender in Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of the illnesses that transmit insects , which researchers and farmers trying to find solutions , big head@@ aches are being prepared . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the last few years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has implications for the life span of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ goat we@@ ars , and in very dry weather there are many of it . &quot;
and there is a lot at stake .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant @-@ ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing down the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce usually take on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leaving them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the Repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal sens@@ ations suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; there are drug traff@@ ick@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate , more and more journalists are at the same time : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to began his post in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editor and inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; T @-@ shirts , wearing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der Public Prosec@@ utor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it took only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists rarely appear in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we are distr@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; twel@@ fth flow &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but for the issue of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that one or more people will be shot at the street every day or that the cemetery is full of en@@ chan@@ ted , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquility if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alling cart@@ els in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake lay in forcing Val@@ dez , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country on its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined the company with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ sia and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led them . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ sia team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a port worker , a friend who was generous with h@@ ug@@ s and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Was his love of the routine be his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their work best and to stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules as he and others say are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed . days before , Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were not trust@@ worthy by the governor themselves . &quot;
&quot; it has been months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce has printed on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expenditure which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
&quot; and there was a group , one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the public prosec@@ utor , conducted a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the whole century all the political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this local area , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez have considered the best informed source about ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; earlier we would have known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was devoted to storing signs and stick@@ ers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the press name . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning because of another journalist for the office of the public prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mic@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by typ@@ ing in organized protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez @-@ case . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and dism@@ iss them because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a veil . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media fan group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were located next to their separate head .
some branches have voted as the paper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ slava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that the drug trade is frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce sat at the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer than once all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ p . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with stre@@ et@@ ri@@ val and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed deaths .
&quot; the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region . &quot;
&quot; from the Bord@@ stein@@ kan@@ te , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ sia via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens were nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who held guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think of closing it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the tra@@ inees asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to escape his enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ ort of a Canadian min@@ er were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something from an &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the per@@ si@@ sting ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil remains a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ riers which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has aston@@ ished researchers , who describe it as &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when on March 21 , 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he hit something that seemed out of the surrounding rock at the place , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy Earth cl@@ umping . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you just blin@@ ked a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with an arm@@ or and is similar to a changing shell , was probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter sh@@ ading that is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have allowed to ming@@ le better with its surroundings and to escape its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the astonishing conservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our about his body .
&quot; they discovered the cas@@ c@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the cas@@ c@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure through meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use the conc@@ ert@@ ness - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which indicates that this no@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of prey must have been , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal in notes about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal tract , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and dri@@ fted into the sea where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was so warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much far@@ ther inland as they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is on sleep . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch sp@@ ik@@ es that stood by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the sub@@ tropical rep@@ ay@@ ment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the door@@ step still covers b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it gets . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the sheds at its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ er@@ long st@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , around 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; according to the first statements by the police , between the outlets Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , nearly 30 cars , among them probably trucks , were inter@@ tw@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; at first , there is no information about the exact number of publishers . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , a police spokes@@ man said . &quot;
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re long tail was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade noted itself the hall@@ marks of the vehicle tra@@ ilers that now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingen@@ ious thought .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the conductor and awak@@ ens an uns@@ killed or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
card control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the freel@@ ance road@@ map control .
it is simply confirmed by phone that you can take your seat and thereby vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train de@@ bit de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers .
&quot; it also has to be purchased via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the test customers , a button to the electronic de@@ valuation will appear . &quot;
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the driver is in the driver &apos;s ticket inspection at Platz Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspec@@ tions by our train att@@ endant personnel , the DB Navigator is simply checked by yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , CEO of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel by rail know that in addition to bel@@ ong@@ ings and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not all the documents you need to de@@ valuation online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , resulting in poor mood in part or greater space and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional train numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to answer the question : &quot; wh@@ ats Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken up to its core . &quot;
only one day after having arrived in New York City sitting in St. Louis bushes sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone from high school .
&quot; the police had just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; confused , because nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly wor@@ shipped on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ et the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos from the police band and people crying out , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman claimed his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , to which we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened during the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from age 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and strength that consists in the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask for answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who bore a flower @-@ dress and a fitting crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that she had inn@@ umer@@ able times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a lat@@ ent racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel that I would prove to be a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter associated with a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on eating @-@ fair@@ ness and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration , Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r , wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to mind : &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death @-@ insect @-@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his dedication brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; team in the years after browsing . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but rather a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ an &apos;s life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; Fer@@ rel said , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not acci@@ dental , although she was at the forefront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration .
it describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she accum@@ ulates a voice and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say , &quot; That would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the supporters believe that a gallery draws more customers into the city , including the other businesses , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing companies offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will end . &quot;
&quot; the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility of sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been selling almost every week in the Farm@@ market Hall for many years .
mainly our eggs but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities this is also possible .
&quot; in particular , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers move in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent is coming . &quot;
&quot; this should probably not be low in the new project , however . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that super@@ flu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of it in our city already .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is very inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; there is a pity , specialty shops there are almost no more and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall go during construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution , even if the bit @-@ gallery actually comes . &quot;
or does the gh@@ ost bit @-@ gallery manage to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg before ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to take a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no more space . &quot;
&quot; if the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown that are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and Haar@@ lem that were sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
&quot; M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being secretly classified as secret diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called a Bec@@ oming resem@@ bl@@ ance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; de@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by M@@ anning and created out of 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to the identity . &quot;
&quot; M@@ anning , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white self @-@ ie , in which M@@ anning obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with whom she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of foreigners from for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette sl@@ um@@ bers and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal friends , who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili kan@@ ung@@ o , who would fores@@ ee a future in which President Chel@@ sea@@ worthy would turn judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid spl@@ its that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , M@@ anning called for an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written in pencil .
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides , according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people hope to take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Spider Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece of the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel . &quot;
it shows p@@ anning as it appears with a free @-@ talk ef@@ on in the hand from the disciplinary mar@@ ines of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they make your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted the Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; p@@ anning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was fores@@ ighted in the comic book - but when it was to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ations , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted as everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , &quot; Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind their deliver@@ ance . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
&quot; a country @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who were looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts due to murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Police Department of Chicago states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the site of the events , and det@@ ectives examine the engra@@ vings as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them has now been assessed and ruled out by the entrance to the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK to help US investig@@ ators in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to turn .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to ask the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was uncle@@ ar , whether the incident took place on July 27th . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko &quot;
the Russian deputy Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ release of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause anxiety to Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria stated in the list , however , stipul@@ ates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has put an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ u@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains disp@@ uted positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one pret@@ ended to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was exp@@ elled from the WA@@ DA by the WA@@ DA of dop@@ ing controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs any more
they shared the company groups .
&quot; it was a purely precau@@ tion that could not be prec@@ eded by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the announcement . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs to Al@@ di should be supplied , which have been proven neg@@ atively on fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ fertili@@ zers . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency in his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company do not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to check your luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
she called out people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , they allow companies to perform surveys , to offer specialist groups and demographic groups , and in some cases whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the pursuit of their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment . &quot;
he said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most dis@@ comfort and which executives have low access results so that you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helping to prevent bad behavior and identify , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; the Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible Enterprise lets you send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
&quot; and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has covered the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that its employees are badly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and law@@ suits , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ tible has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company Conver@@ cent employs , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair plac@@ ements can be identified and addressed faster . &quot;
&quot; I can draw closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies knew that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology to monitor ethics , people employed hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recur@@ ring charges for using their products .
it is a business model and a chance that supports Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups .
&quot; the convertible received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only operations . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ dits if their portfolio companies are running well . companies are running well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the use of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , dis@@ appointments can breed and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen a lot of confidence in collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always maintains new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes pose a lunch break .
players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is a true tre@@ t@@ mill for the boys for the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already completed timet@@ ables of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the brood postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as had passed six playing times in West@@ wood for practical exercises . &quot;
they are to be held in August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the multip@@ lier routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it down , they move on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , what in view of the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been filled with foot@@ ball@@ es , which will be a protective grid behind a gate posts , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; bru@@ ising players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people hire a room there and then choose to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking space 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual test@@ ers , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; fac@@ ets , which offer an easy way to limit your search , &quot;
&quot; the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , while the French elec@@ tors were floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts check started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to realizing what stories of fact @-@ inspec@@ tors of third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a novel novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was shown in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the print of thumb on the side of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb @-@ print !
&quot; and letters still smell as smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) this seems all too nice to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena @-@ heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape ste@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last hei@@ r , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that portra@@ y who possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let it go all its way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion calling 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ rol that the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l of the 18th century depic@@ ts his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite gi@@ aun@@ er , getting debts and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise hei@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the territory of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ elle vei@@ ls in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the inauguration of the 301 year old Mari@@ en@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team wish to keep the logo and slogan secret by Nelson Art@@ z . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their un@@ shared website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnef citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action deals with more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Honnef , a mean five @-@ digit amount will cost the new umbrella brand and the campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance an ordinary process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the general staff , as in former times , but at the Prime Minister &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of State , the five vice @-@ ministers as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the number of transi@@ tions . &quot;
the government draws on the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air@@ strikes and the n@@ avy have been dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a drawing pul@@ ler of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people , who should have been involved directly in the attempted coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since that week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as a &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean@@ se the Ar@@ med Forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the Military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns for an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which among other things mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head@@ scarf ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Grand Master in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent more 73@@ 95 operators , including 23@@ 03 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the actual lords of the country earlier .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least in calling for the reform proposals of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is specifically driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a named officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance to inf@@ ant doubt . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he proposes to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary employment permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill shall be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by the US to change the way citizens are issued from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to repair track for race car shuttle
&quot; over the past few months , over the past few months have been disp@@ uted over the future of the race car - now it should be quite fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it is expected to be built at the mar@@ vel route on which the tourist train runs . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race pace in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport this year construction work should start in the course of construction . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue ordering and san@@ itation the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this particularly important connection for tourism , &quot; stated Klaus S@@ üh@@ l &apos;s Minister of Transport on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently finally adjusted , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for eleven years .
the race @-@ up Shuttle was to be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , during a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is used by many people to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the track is also very strong in parts .
&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it . &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it won &apos;t be more crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascent seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key when he published his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from its infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved into robots with a silicone membrane .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; says True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation , or she can be &quot; &quot; in spirit &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female qualities , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : rel@@ uc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to somewhat dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they remain temporary at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what perme@@ ates out of the marginal zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the exposed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , taken to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply walk away .
&quot; they do not have a mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are f@@ aint slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the expression of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney an ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a jum@@ per of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized US voters , have split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives . &quot;
we are all supposed to burst out our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ th@@ and poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely independently on the same side . &quot;
&quot; the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it falls in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issuing of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and &quot; tr@@ ump , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his kit@@ ties will no longer be disc@@ ar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; the right wing , which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ kom@@ isch version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % In@@ come Tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to a very mild off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ousel of the New York car park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn away to look full of fear about their own shoulders - most resour@@ c@@ eful and the clim@@ ing music medi@@ ates this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the them@@ ed pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage counts not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park car@@ ousel is still a strange magical experience , as here two years old , a 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the review with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing gr@@ ati@@ fying while I tired the experience to give her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospit@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was transferred to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of St. Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by scre@@ aming her several times through a door of the toilet booth in his house in Pre@@ toria .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al in@@ tru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is too transparent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be raised to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
&quot; as a farmer , Arnold finds a curious egg &quot;
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ees from F@@ ully and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the discharge students will go to the secondary school , four on the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the &quot; &quot; Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental &quot; &quot; in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der selected a young eagle , who grows up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a curious egg , and left it out of his chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and we@@ pt . &quot;
after that the classes showed three and four in the introduction of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who bore the cylinder to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ leg@@ ged vessel that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; thank@@ s@@ words followed to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps at teaching positions , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; she will leave her students only very ung@@ od@@ ly after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ leg@@ ged äss@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer and holiday season . &quot;
there was great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ people are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegal people in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while at present an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court can impose a fine penalty .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel @-@ drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offer software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve emission levels of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles , the Schumacher software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fit ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the next few months , but not yet an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has told each person to write .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fitting move altogether ?
&quot; heavy to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
this hangs from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first r@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted awards by the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution on Thursday announced , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards will be awarded at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore announced that participation in the gala has already announced .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify her view . &quot;
&quot; according to the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city li@@ vable
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to rent next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is a city builder .
and the work still makes him great fun as he im@@ par@@ ted in the press brief@@ ing .
&quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that no application has fulfilled the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next time .
&quot; according to the regular dism@@ iss@@ al periods , there is still enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub @-@ contractor , the applicant must assign corresponding conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could no longer fill it out , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but citizens &apos; proximity to the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated to look back on the cr@@ ackers with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; he is sure about the building department and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz are about to be found . &quot;
&quot; the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter will strike with some 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
creative is present for a city @-@ builder of great play @-@ space .
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener , it is possible to react flexibly to many . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often mentioned praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what is pure &quot; when new buildings are approved , the distingu@@ ishing Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is carrying high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs through my table . &quot;
&quot; in the case of care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes to say : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay in place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , according to the city of Has@@ lach you should have completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or with the subject of architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of building construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) under@@ lines high and civil engineering , construction planning , foundation activities , administration of urban real estate , urban farm with building yard and city garden , as well as Unter@@ e Bau@@ Legisl@@ ative Office including monument protection . &quot;
cycling on pi@@ pel@@ ines thrown : South railway track closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway line transfer in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were so badly damaged by the fact that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them for the night .
&quot; near the Tat@@ ort , witnesses had been observed with a ros@@ ary roller and a bike rider . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Lausanne region , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators could have brought themselves into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport , p@@ enn@@ ales of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , to go out of a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired at Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ way route could be led without obstruc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people were killed on Friday afternoon , two of them watched the long distance . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they were late . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres had to be exchanged . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; however , a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , hiding in food , do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflamm@@ ations , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the constitu@@ ents of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich diet toler@@ ate , less inflammatory bow@@ el lie@@ us , if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; post@@ doc@@ s Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an investigated a kind of immune cell that stimul@@ ates tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; it presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial symptoms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and there were six species of bacteria found in the mice with the immune cells , but lacking in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they did not develop an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on imm@@ atur@@ ated immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component was cle@@ ans@@ ed out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ und Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup commen@@ ced on Tuesday , and impressive in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira moved to Bel@@ i@@ eben . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho added that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho added three more commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , for that I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
&quot; Boeing , Boeing , has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a car@@ dio test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such an advertisement .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new low@@ job for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind rot@@ ates : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , social @-@ democratic Prime Ministers immediately looked to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only a fire from the party central , but no head@@ wind from the Bund - was the most important desire of the ball@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with a growing horror . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not even be described in the approach with head@@ wind . &quot;
there were sur@@ charges .
and one by one .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; five months before the country elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Federal Executive Officer Michael Kell@@ ner called on the stub@@ born lower @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U represents a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately withdraw its mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens in the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this may not be true at all , &quot; &quot; an SPD electoral campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs , when the new Job &apos;s message reaches the party centre on Friday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the accession of the green Euro MPs , El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional high point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly significant defeat in the Saarland region in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more than not , the comrades calm themselves at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was the case , and everything was much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te pushed the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after , the comrades were struggling with difficulty . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came . &quot;
and with him the next grav@@ itation came .
&quot; mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communications he did everything wrong , which could be done wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in the criticism for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey results were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no guilt in the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Green Party . &quot;
and Schulz at all .
&quot; at times , the comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the absurd parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anism T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen places her own career on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected to parliament because of her personality as a direct candidate , but on the state list of Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , so the lower @-@ Saxon MPs . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , acc@@ uses an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; wild four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments of CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
grants for the nucleus III
&quot; who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EG Urban Development informed on Wednesday .
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , it has been given in sen@@ ti@@ ent areas of rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations have been a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to encourage the development of the interior , not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the Pres@@ idency of the government of Karlsruhe that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III . &quot;
&quot; the amount of funding was 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the municipality felt . &quot;
how does a refurb@@ ishment area come about ?
&quot; I will continue to examine Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned territory at all .
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; the ST@@ EG represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal @-@ state programme &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Stadt &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; core of the program is the revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the restructuring area would then finally be defined as a proposition .
&quot; since January 1 , 2017 , the grant period has been running until 30 April 2026 . &quot;
&quot; until September this year , however , the current consumption would be carried out only once , as part of those involved in the restructuring area involved a questionn@@ aire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the constitution shall be carried out as soon as possible , so that in the coming year it can begin with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every municipality must carry out the pre @-@ planned pre @-@ investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic ab@@ norm@@ alities , and decide when to get rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot;
a re@@ mark in the land register will be registered for the respective property .
&quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after sensation and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphasized , a key success factor for the project is the involvement of the participants . &quot;
&quot; this is why there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent post@@ ally to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and property arch &quot; , &quot; in which it is about the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing arch , &quot; information about size , layout and ro@@ omm@@ ates of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operational arc &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionn@@ aire does not at the same time submit an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed the fact that the distribution of funding is working according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , is grinding first . &quot;
&quot; no funding fees could be made for later &quot; &quot; reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; nucleus II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to come to house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a Consult@@ ative An@@ aes@@ th@@ ist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military specification provided to the TIME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , vice president Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was shown next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superior , the Deputy Navy commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening was cleared . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
the original flight occup@@ ant was during the event during the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the ground .
&quot; from the records provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to con@@ serve government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was against the backdrop of its first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of announcements that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet . &quot;
&quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the vice president of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area , in order to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res . &quot;
&quot; as Tr@@ ump at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew over 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ary records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the flight as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are made in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top riders of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga compete in the championship k@@ icks Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel in the championship k@@ icks Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV .
&quot; despite after five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga made sense for the reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , always playing in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; on the back positions , I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf SV especially the imports from the high north are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; the Fr@@ ench@@ man Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first time in this season . &quot;
the so far un@@ conqu@@ erable Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be in ke@@ el as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , also Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could move into the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was number one of the Junior World Ranking list in January 2016 , doesn &apos;t fill up someone from the train@@ erst@@ ab by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ re . &quot;
how America can harm the OM@@ V
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he continued his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , the Congress passed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels lined up against the U.S. infrin@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft seems to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the native OM@@ V have been al@@ armed , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea North Stream 2 together with other European companies . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions to life by an executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at which the Group could defend , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is cent@@ red in the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over . &quot;
&quot; the relay three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ ghts of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traff@@ icking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only with more government bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal is back as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
the city turns 46 Kü@@ ch@@ enh@@ aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day care centers , the clock is revers@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy leader in the field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we all were very happy . &quot;
cooked will continue to be out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh Gek@@ o@@ ks .
&quot; the city operates 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; in the last day of kit@@ esur@@ fing , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are supervised by 45 hours of the week , in the K@@ ita to lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time workers have kitchen service from September 1st : they heat the delivered food , complement it with salads , raw food and fruit , portions the meal individually , give food out , clean the food , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ch@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decide on the scope of the class .
&quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ f training to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it is important that healthy food and cooking lessons are also important . &quot;
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the ch@@ ick @-@ up force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of kitchen juices - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power , has also the charm that they have found themselves in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign lending for the city as the most economical issue , is it from the press office . &quot;
and that although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ configured .
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the education area , &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ son , deputy head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ eling in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on April 5 .
&quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international martial arts to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections will be handed over to the next elections for the first time peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ at said , a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; the Afghan independent El@@ ection Commission reports that 1.2 million women registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters registered . &quot;

men try to cut 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have attempted to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to the police information , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stood up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 o &apos;clock because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s phone . &quot;
&quot; however , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request and continued with her friends . &quot;
&quot; then one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , however , which was too long . &quot;
without loo@@ t the duo fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make sure that Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers have long @-@ term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; first experience &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insi@@ sted on &quot; concerns &quot; that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the work forces focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of employment , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross won first a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , we are constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
La Liga &apos;s website may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not ref@@ rain from N@@ ey@@ mar after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record incident ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out to the outside , although a source close to the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club , who wanted to sign one of the best players at PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , then this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G clearly made it impossible for the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ ot@@ ers dropped and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has shed light on a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the estate number 30 , and so disgu@@ ised at the fair@@ ing of the vehicle property damage of more than 200 Euro . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for information . &quot;
the police witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he encountered a car on his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and touched the control panel . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old came from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW at 19.@@ 55 o &apos;clock on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger came to meet him in his lane , so he had to escape to the right . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the Tour@@ an driver touched the control panel . &quot;
in the car accident occurred .
&quot; the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of traffic accidents . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident . &quot;
&quot; the police are now asking witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the poll@@ uter experience , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is further deb@@ ated .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; &quot; Wir sind Kirche &quot; , &quot; declared after publication from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or at that time false estim@@ ation of the events .
&quot; the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen there were &quot; two kinds of measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the interference in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of design@@ ating the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
also Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a fr@@ ing@@ ed fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows would have been a very normal educational tool , &quot; &quot; to be done with young children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger wrote the reminder &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which the German lawyer Ulrich Weber ordered by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg has presented to the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of assault , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said that Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. were used in many cases physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students was even more intense . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accused , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , might even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal has reli@@ eved in his opinion with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against protection of protection at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; , &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students raise his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible to the listen@@ er when a dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you are making the effort and reading the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in general at all . &quot;
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
violence exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school took place outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; it is possible to disc@@ ard it at best , to experience it too late or have first clari@@ fications not taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um &apos;s gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was felt by virtually all the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es as &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the broad majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; &quot; always surrounded by children &apos;s grapes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; he himself admitted , deeply de@@ pl@@ ored and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such methods of breeding ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us born in front of 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually goes in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , Bag@@ at@@ ella is ad@@ mitt@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; one wonders if it &apos;s not related to his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed upon him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian Pope , many people who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also put any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
&quot; not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults , claiming to be entrusted to the Cathedral Master . &quot;
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said one of the wounded representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings trusted , then certainly not a choir director , who , however , professionally had been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do the scr@@ ape students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a asked disciple formulated it in such a way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it seems to him ... Bu@@ ben are more intr@@ usive or clearer or even more likely to have opened than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , confidence teachers etc . &quot;
that you talk about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed within the scope of the study . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any involvement . &quot;
&quot; thus , he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these war@@ y crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; was read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; obstruc@@ ting &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : yes , this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed with a huge reporting of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly that is again an abuse of the report .
&quot; there it is clean separately : between the primary school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , and , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful exam@@ iner ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly sli@@ pped and mal@@ igned , and among them horri@@ bly suffered , all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this was , as most of the witnesses pointed out , the subject of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , associate positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most , remains the repro@@ ach to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently swal@@ low the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this , he pointed out that in the pre @-@ school , the test was still practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as exam@@ in@@ ers had long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers were exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ sed , and where really the per@@ missible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he had always looked away .
this just isn &apos;t right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the punishment for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Tax@@ is said yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; Case of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past , according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right .
&quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence to innocent children &apos;s soul , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
it &apos;s all horrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be stopped .
&quot; but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear @-@ eyes and the hair and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger period has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of testing also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , that the domain cats played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not yet conc@@ ede that he led there a rig@@ orous reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without requiring un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys are no longer doing a big singer and before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during conversations with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and repeatedly experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep believing and heart@@ felt people , of whom one could not imagine that he could only do something a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ ery , regularly contact him , visit him , he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; today , most of the cats are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strong father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect for respect , to which they still look up and which they down@@ right . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clear : everything you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long been overcoming this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the start @-@ up would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bay@@ erns and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
