<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren Anstalt, where young people should meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kleingärtner manage the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card München encourages exciting stories to day.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"everyone knows that, because the car-navi instead of a bypass road showed a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the geoportals of Bavaria in the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flickering carpet, which one does not recognize as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large picture card, more detailed maps, so-called" "original composition", "were incorporated into cities and communities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops with the peace of Lunéville came off from February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 1856, the original composition sheet for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like any other on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek."</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, so 1877, as part of the Munich city district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming appears a small-proportioned card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered bottles from the so-called" "urine", "from which the cornerstone was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots today show no more farmers, but small gardeners of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, actually was a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of the current district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" am Gasteig "or" On the air "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once closed people with insanity."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenanstalt," On the Auer Lüften. ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudder headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the personnel to apply violence against the inmates," "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients first there was space, later on 500 places were extended."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper-Klinikum in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Salesianum in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it to a youth shelter with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built in architectural renunciation of the original building of the Irrenal Institute, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in 1856 as" "main place", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies risked a lot of holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a vault chapel from the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof where this day was the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk road."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the sliders, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to Promote Faroe has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the Federal State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the whole state and be noted here," it says in the group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionately target minorities, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted or killed because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the trip and was taken custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by Missouri's office, which is shown that black drivers in the state will be held 75 percent more frequently than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be ready, whether they bring potential money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri reported 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which rank the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company due to housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU's view on other racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Bedezvous project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU parliamentarians Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Location Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members at the right-grabbing of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his operation, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 deciduous cows and also many young kittens and accommodated in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidecaunprojekt as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably operate on such a steep terrain.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space care for a lot of work, much has to be machined with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not perform a biooperation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the significance of the fence project and is glad about the leader-promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers must be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and worrying about how they continue their business," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in criticism because of their encouragement.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area is 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of €71 500, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter contributed to the community of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "stated Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you do a really good job, without farmers and housewives. "</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter white stood firm: "here the best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Directory (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state-of-the-art support of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of a conveyor belt designated by the LPR is required.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area must not be towed (slope incline over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"at the moment, eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build a fence around 16 kilometres, are currently running for the Fischerbacher Weidecaunprojekt 2018."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the auditorium is equivalent to 35 hectares, which costs more than €112 million."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate these as well as any other, therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president for drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of landowners and Liberty Imitators would have smiled him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he picked up their meaning, and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta described," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, to which you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invade any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who are longing to breathe freely, / the miserable garbage of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "smiling waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death - knew very well that they had accomplished a highly-political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in an unused classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changes this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change this for a long time from the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not invited, but rather an early neoconservative, which brings the American flame into the world around:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not be enlightened by the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elusive but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the ships of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not to lighten the path, but to ignite the hatred which is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black lodges Scottish members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the United Kingdom's team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the United Kingdom's Athletics, Neil Black says, that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special develops" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is quite modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medallists, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" unbelievable "that 16 cataracts are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The high-speed runner Muir is on this road and has five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another grotto that one should observe after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" hugely proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to go to Podium."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out and compete there, and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blockage of critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the local voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from the domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he slipped in criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like sheep."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people, who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">"and the American Civil Liberties Union, therefore, complained him at the beginning of this week."</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor Staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and rigorous adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his electors and to play his hairy head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, is designated as official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hoess spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasserted people, which vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not crowded, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't value this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are ignored by some rather than so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the staff of the governor called" "concentrated spam attack", "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic, or delete a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical material items and to arrest and silence protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County last the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit to the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portion had a similar effect as the internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied in between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters smashed on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, criticised by the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his post, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech and discourses belong to the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">The former Europeans no. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort during the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.</seg>

<seg id="215">"that feels really special," "said the player in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">"I did not have to defend the Extremadura Open, since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it."</seg>
<seg id="217">To come back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one we will always appreciate.</seg>

<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you play at home," "said Orr, the man from Helensburgh."</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I am happy about how it went so far.</seg>
<seg id="227">"the Trio in the field is the former champion Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty."</seg>

<seg id="443">It is a period that went down on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone.</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, on the occasion of the anniversary of the church church, on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30 p.m. a serenade is invited."</seg>

<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumblingen a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique rural treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische pronouncements: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document of the document, on the Tumour mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a glorious courtyard, to which the church or the patronal law belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>

<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded in 1692 for the first time, but later it had to be released in 1942 during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were cut and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>

<seg id="485">"they removed the pulpit and church-mill, and used it as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumour Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilary Church broke off.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm split the bell tower and half collapsed."</seg>

<seg id="867">"Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also get better after the experience in preparation with the tripled ette, than with the quattire."</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how we will act in Aue," "says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing," "because we have just in the triplette on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, who can build well," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we do not do so many abnormalities in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you can speak about an undecided start, don't know."</seg>

<seg id="875">"the start of the season only after six to eight playing days," "said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to an accident."</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season almost with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna versus an ascension favorite in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they do not know as 100 percent where they are currently standing," says the defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"indeed, the guests from the Rhineland see as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we are sweeping away, just because we have the right to come under the first six, is stupid," "says Funkel, whose balance sheet is quite positive at only one defeat against Aue from nine matches."</seg>

<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in statistics of past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said to the magazine The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases suggesting that the understated person is 18 years or older."</seg>

<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to forge teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play Rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG will eventually prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can make money with certainty, so that Neymar subscribes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may have a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but they must be subject to legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break-even point in their on the football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Platini, following his election to the UEFA president in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"former French players believed that clubs, who had put enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich, originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Ungnad, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the debt collection can be expended for the next five years in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the financial statements."</seg>

<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to supersede their financial supervision by mowing their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>

<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 disputed that Neymar WM ambassadors will be ambassadors and will be easy to figure out such manoeuvres for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more alert to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>

<seg id="1159">"in recent years, Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss Life."</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet co-operation is in front of a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and undergo a quality control.</seg>

<seg id="1169">"as many candidates give it to the new tender, Swiss will not want to betray."</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper article, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1172">"for the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achievable for a statement."</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is at the same time nostalgically because of the glorious days of the characters of the eighties, for the 90-year Grunge era (as the visionary David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for himself - that is, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>

<seg id="1231">"according to the data, ten million people with foreign citizenship have been recorded in the register, among them some 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"since the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality has not been good in parts so far."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"data from 1921 was found in individual cases," "of people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation dampened speculation on an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when they contributed interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the Bank's political decision-makers (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.25%, with less members in this month to increase, as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue to rise to just below 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but they signalized that in the next few years, interest rates would be necessary to curb the inflation of the Brexit and said that credit costs could possibly rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mammut business package, issued a year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, although it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central forecast of the MPC, GDP (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as pressure on the real income of households continues to pollute consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at interest rates, they repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary to cool down inflation and a" somewhat bigger "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that" "gradual" "and" "limited" "increases would take place."</seg>
<seg id="1274">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The Pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">"the pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to 1,11 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is easy to recover after the Bank towards the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor increases, as the sharpening becomes even worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy cannot" "prevent the income statement" "in the coming years, but added that the wages for the end of their three-year forecast will be" "clear". ""</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote caused by the sinking of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until it will complete the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rate was increasing, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers in July demanding an increase of 0.5%."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has declined from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them over the next few months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Bank said that the exceedance of 2% is" "entirely" "attributable to the weak pound."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" "in view of the recent swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again because the lenders are looking silently for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way."</seg>

<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) should prescribe 10,000 people contentious HIV drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">"in September following a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in NHS, patients will receive access to a" transformative "HIV prevention treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a pre-treatment prophylaxis used before sexual intercourse (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now provided by healthcare through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the assertion that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an" important new intervention, "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to make the registration of people possible, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prevention prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medicine taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection-prone areas.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well-known due to antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National Aids Trust) said," This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV. "</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted for vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards people with high HIV-risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument, which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We heartily welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delayed and reluctant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, became a Earls Court Apartment in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Doom and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over one another, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative in order to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelwork is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other, without having to push us."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height, with a lot of additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"mirrors play a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special feature of this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so when you push the door, slide very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor area, and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and that can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you in electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself into something completely astonished by a good design and increased square meter.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them."</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including reports on news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with leading employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: bad information entering the president's hands."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by overseeing its media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship with television last decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince him," said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit ever was "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we do not know - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn something about the tweets which Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his colleagues manage to stay away from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it from calling troubling trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a white house, consisting of competing parties, try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material, which may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors, the president for strategic reasons, doubting information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with embarrassing leaks, and that he insists on finding out where these originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a pile of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes, or that he has offered no specific evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump las the article and started asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his advisers still strive for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">"from Birkenhof to" "Waldhotel Luise" ""</seg>
<seg id="1445">"from the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is located."</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof, by the former Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH to 13 April 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenue was lost due to the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of a dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who arrived in the administrative district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented asylum seekers from setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group Luisenhotels with manager Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>

<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building construction shuttings in front of the entrance since a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"floors were torn out, ceilings are partially dismantled, old bathtubs from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">"until March, there is still much to do."</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should become" "beautiful bourgeois" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewelry drilled." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so shaver."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's notions are the same with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under one million euros, he pays."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the outer complexes are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: us Special Representative sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoters Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury following a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the body has taken up the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "on appeal to people familiar with it."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the broadcaster CNN reported, there are already the initial charges of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between Trumps äldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">"U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin for a long time, purposefully interfered with in the 2016 presidential campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of investigations, several men should stand, who acted as advisor to the republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Representative Trump has personally moved to the centre and undermining the accusation whether the President may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to check the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the Trial Chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, pre-charges have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the meeting, people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to say that it was in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his wife-in-law Paul Manafort also participated in the discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work, and that he should act quickly if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up on the end to decide on the charging of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the Gremidium was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme gives the democrats a way to" feel good, "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he didn't know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"these work, however, usually work in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any action that accelerates the work of the special agent on "fair" means.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey stated three times that he would not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">"Mueller, however, had only been used after Trump Comey had fired."</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this root, accusations against Trump had become loud, he intended to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June, in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following the presentation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special agents and his collaborators."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent promoter of Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the presidency of the President of the Justice Department."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"however, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of republican and democratic senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday, after which the special issuer could not be dismissed so easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the scarcely seven-fold size of Berlin was solved by the Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was divided by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres large colossus now travel to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, is unclear according to research data."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there have been a series of unusual interruptions of cuddles in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facet background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It grows more and more into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula south of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this course, the balance of waxing and abort was disrupted a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelfeisen was disassembled there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn so far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level since they float on the water and consume ice as much water as it results in melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a small extent, the British research project writes for the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI information, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-biggest glacier in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the passage from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and has no direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have argued whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, said Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg not to climate change, many cuddle of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of Antarctica extends toward South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the iron surface of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">"as a result, the increase in temperature has contributed."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic peninsula has been warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, thereby counting towards the areas where the temperature is fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants home tarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU asks to leave the employer's association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only shortly before the summer break, the day of the circle experienced 41 new jobs in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 trainees now have their first working day behind them."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers at the circle are obviously very popular.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were listed for the seats that were in vain this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"currently, there are 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term needs for professionals, but to counteract the forward-looking of candidate shortages."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should focus on the inside and outside, show specific measures for cross-entry and include an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is from a regular "competition of the public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"for this purpose, a high number of employees who have to leave hospital or age-related illnesses result from the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"maximum time for action, so that no more jobs remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he had long since taken care of a big surprise in the day of the day, when he publicly challenged the costs of personnel and blossoms the remaining parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all the possibilities to be checked, which allow an exit from the communal employers association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aim at a house rate," "said peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to pay better to the employees and officials than the rate of collective bargaining is actually foreseen."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money exist only if you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees will take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law."</seg>
<seg id="1578">"last but not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff."</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German Relief Organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which was in operation only for a year, refused to express himself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor of Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the rescue of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a statement on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">We can only assess all accusations that are being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, which has been monitoring since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew accepts inflatable migrants, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acts, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of being overthrown over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa, above all, have to board an Italian police officer who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been ready to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring significant changes or disabilities to their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Laureate Organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy, was greatly reduced to the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with the local mayors."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine female bikers, the" Berlin Outpost "and two guest-drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region for four days to enjoy trials and sights."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there followed views, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents, for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, lookout at the lookout point, connected by" flocked "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again many altimeters.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and stony huts brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled in the air inhalatorium curative Sole.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 altimeters, the group had got to know the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - athletic and culturally."</seg>

<seg id="1613">"in the future, the sports stars will sit in front of computer consoles, rather than sweating through wind and weather over the stadium racing?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-Sport has long since become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this also has recognised the first federal ligavera, which are increasingly involved in this field."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and lastly the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says Management Board Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," that there are still some clubs going on this train. "</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend the FIFA World Federation FIFA in London organizes the first" "Interactive Club World Cup", "where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven was qualified."</seg>

<seg id="1622">The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-sportsmen under contract, one could be more often present in these markets online than once a year to send the federal union to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in the e-sport, computer games like" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or just football-simulation FIFA on the level of competition are fought."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, Ligen has long since become established in which professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certain to be used."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobler also sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more a subject."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the way internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no cross-cultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the company consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicted rapid growth ahead of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, turnover is expected to be 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"in addition to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, e-sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultant. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">"a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy spoke on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions took Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any regrets." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carters attorney said it was a" "terrible circumstance that they totally regret." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said however, he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor was reading a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" "no day, in which I don't rob the loss of my beloved son."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I am concerned with everything. I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain, which we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters."</seg>

<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, create yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent her in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly Riodosice usually take on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leaving them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the Reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal sensations suffice."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and throughout the country the corpses accumulate, more and more journalists are at the same time: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto began his post in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editor and inspiration from Riodosice, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word" Justice, "T-shirts, wearing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Public Prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it took only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders, which are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists rarely appear in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodosice, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we are distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodosice in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "twelfth flow". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but for the issue of Valdez, there is practically nothing silenced."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that one or more people will be shot at the street every day or that the cemetery is full of enchanted, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquility if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodosice, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalling cartels in war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have angered the sons, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake lay in forcing Valdez, following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country on its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined the company with five colleagues to establish Riodosia and sold 50 US dollar holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the dowry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodosice, she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" "for its coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dummy."</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodosia team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a port worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Was his love of the routine be his ruin?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their work best and to stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start and runways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodosice Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules as he and others say are no longer valid in Sinaloa, just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodosice met for safety training, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed. days before, Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodosice in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who were not trustworthy by the governor themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the edition of this week, Riodosice has printed on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditure which concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the public prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the whole century all the political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local area, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez have considered the best informed source about abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was devoted to storing signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the press name."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning because of another journalist for the office of the public prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Micoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by typing in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the Valdez-case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and dismiss them because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a veil."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media fan group" Articulo 19 "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die, because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have voted as the paper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue on how El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade is frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodosice sat at the pavement in front of the office and drank beer than once all their telephones began to sump."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with streetrival and security forces near the Mazatlan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"the war escalated, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region."</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the Bordsteinkante, they have published the news on the website of Riodosia via mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens were nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who held guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodosice followed his traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think of closing it," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the trainees asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to escape his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers found out that the first findings of the incredible Nashort of a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had had something from an" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the persisting armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil remains a newly discovered species of Nodosauriers which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved state has astonished researchers, who describe it as" "truly remarkable". ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he hit something that seemed out of the surrounding rock at the place, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy Earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinked a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that this herbivorous, although covered with an armor and is similar to a changing shell, was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter shading that is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have allowed to mingle better with its surroundings and to escape its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the cascading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the cascading is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure through meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use the concertness - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which indicates that this nodoscope was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs of prey must have been," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal in notes about his life, including his conserved intestinal tract, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and drifted into the sea where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was so warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland as they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is on sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures had an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch spikes that stood by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the subtropical repayment of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the doorstep still covers bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a gain in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it gets."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the sheds at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1977">"it was a matter of light to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of emergency vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation runs on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort Check-in" "calls the train debit devaluation without Schaffner."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, however, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it also has to be purchased via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "comfort check-in" "works like this: one climbs into the train, calling his ticket under" "My Tickets". ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"for the test customers, a button to the electronic devaluation will appear."</seg>

<seg id="2007">"so you can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspections by our train attendant personnel, the DB Navigator is simply checked by yourself."</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers, resulting in poor mood in part or greater space and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police had just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because nobody else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly worshipped on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She dropped her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos from the police band and people crying out, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a shield with the inscription:" Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman claimed his rifle and cried," "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill." ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder, to which we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened during the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from age 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and strength that consists in the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask for answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who bore a flower-dress and a fitting crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that she had innumerable times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," "Ferrell said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a latent racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel that I would prove to be a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station when she arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there Ferrell and her daughter associated with a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">"slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on eating-fairness and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration, Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farr, wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to mind:" do you want to document, or try to find a story you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently declared in an interview," We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death-insect-mates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his dedication brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the" Whose Streets "team in the years after browsing."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferris's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but rather a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferran's life as she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrel said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" BlackLivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," Ferrel said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not accidental, although she was at the forefront, because in a life on these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the social-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she accumulates a voice and she feels committed to this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they are not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone divides the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit-gallery say," That would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" no man "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the supporters believe that a gallery draws more customers into the city, including the other businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing companies offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Platz, with the possibility of sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been selling almost every week in the Farmmarket Hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are always very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities this is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"in particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers move in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this should probably not be low in the new project, however."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping palaces in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of it in our city already.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is very inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the local rents are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"there is a pity, specialty shops there are almost no more and that which is still left will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall go during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution, even if the bit-gallery actually comes."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit-gallery manage to drive all shops from Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to take a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg no more space."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"if the farmers market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown that are almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg by Wangen-Tuppers and Haarlem that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst banned a 35-year prison sentence after being secretly classified as secret diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called a Becoming resemblance (a matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"dewey-Hagborg originated through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created out of 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to the identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white self-ie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with whom she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts such as cigarette slumbers and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili kanungo, who would foresee a future in which President Chelseaworthy would turn judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid splits that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a particular reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to" automatic fragmentation, "the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hope to take with it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spider Memories, is also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece of the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows panning as it appears with a free-talk efon in the hand from the disciplinary marines of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they make your speech, then they have won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greeted the Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"panning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was foresighted in the comic book - but when it was to do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which gather like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted as everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, "Mannings Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind their deliverance."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a country-wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who were looking for suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants due to murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Police Department of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead on the site of the events, and detectives examine the engravings as murder while the police actively seek the two suspects, said officials."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice-President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been assessed and ruled out by the entrance to the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal issue examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "said Cubbage."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that" "we are in contact with the police in the UK to help US investigators in any way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to ask the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their place of residence and our efforts to locate them," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear, whether the incident took place on July 27th."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2179">"the Grand Plaza's management team published an explanation of the inhabitants:" the police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researches a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident. "</seg>

<seg id="2181">The Russian deputy Vitaly Mutko said it won't be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," "stated Mutko on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re-release of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause anxiety to Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria stated in the list, however, stipulates that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in the Russian sport."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation, because our anti-doping system has put an error."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no state programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutuko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains disputed positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one pretended to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was expelled from the WADA by the WADA of doping controls in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"however, you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD)."</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at the waxing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, they allow companies to perform surveys, to offer specialist groups and demographic groups, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of their health, but where is Fitbit for your company?"

<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their tricot-tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should begin at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the already completed timetables of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise away from the two days is more than a day, at which the brood postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras had passed six playing times in Westwood for practical exercises."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was shown in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says melancholy. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story has been illustrated by another, upcoming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted to the print of thumb on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb-print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters still smell as smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were also there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Ah, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") this seems all too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyena-heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape steers, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" Whiskey "and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive which he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that portray who possessed:" one could think that land conflicts would be boring, "Rhodes says," but there was a birch in order to have fought the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let it go all its way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history, among them 'The Labourer', which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion calling 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knife Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patrol that the family Darrell hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell of the 18th century depicts his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney:" the gentlemen seemed to be quite giauner, getting debts and spending money for things they could not afford. "</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell-men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise heirs."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the territory of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2338">"each year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirees and promotions in the officer corps."</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance an ordinary process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2346">"the Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office but the commanders of the army, the airstrikes and the navy have been dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="2347">"since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals."</seg>
<seg id="2348">"over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile-preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a drawing puller of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who should have been involved directly in the attempted coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since that week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt as a" "gift of God", "as he gave him the opportunity to fully cleanse the Armed Forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Discomfort in the Military headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns for an increasing" "Islamization" "of the army, which among other things manifests itself in the abolition of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the Grand Master in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan sent more 7395 operators, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be the actual lords of the country earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they appealed to their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least in calling for the reform proposals of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is specifically driving an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "a named officer, who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt, would be" full of extremists and Salafists in a few years. ""</seg>
<seg id="2362">"if this is true, such a development could not be cold."</seg>

<seg id="2388">"the rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it won't be more crazy in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascent seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them more often," "said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved from its inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a Stepford woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved into robots with a silicone membrane.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed figures such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," "says True Companion."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed to conversation, or she can be" "in spirit" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female qualities, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing sophistication point to somewhat darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course have no sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain temporary at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what permeates out of the marginal zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the exposed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, taken to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply walk away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they do not have a mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are faint slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the expression of 2017: maids</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone she knows, including the republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely independently on the same side."</seg>

<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the issuing of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and" trump, "we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kitties will no longer be discarded."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more difficult long-term scenario, in which Trump republicans" normalize "the right wing, which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urkomisch version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% Income Tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur to a very mild offence."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York car park, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals turn away to look full of fear about their own shoulders - most resourceful and the climing music mediates this in a strange way."</seg>

<seg id="2494">"at the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offer software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars."</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve emission levels of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6.</seg>

<seg id="2563">"if you want to inherit Roland Wacker, according to the city of Haslach you should have completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with the subject of architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of building construction and construction planning law."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"however, a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300,000, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes, hiding in food, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammations, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the constituents of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan-rich diet tolerate, less inflammatory bowel lieus, if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"postdocs Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that stimulates tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial symptoms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced and there were six species of bacteria found in the mice with the immune cells, but lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they did not develop an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immaturated immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleansed out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan-metabolism, known as an indol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, costs taxpayers according to the military specification provided to the TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, vice president Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, built in Connecticut, was shown next to a yacht from Maine, a fire brigade from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superior, the Deputy Navy commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on July 17 at 3 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening was cleared."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight occupant was during the event during the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could hurt the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," "wrote the commander."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are closed," the deputy commander answered. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to conserve government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>

<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew over 11 hours on that day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budgetary records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the flight as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at this time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present this week things that are made in America," "said Spicer."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know Sikorsky and the state Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>

<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger express their deep regret about their own omissions or at that time false estimation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican paper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that in the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen there were" two kinds of measures. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the interference in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful deeds "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of designating the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and this is a fringed fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" blows would have been a very normal educational tool, "" to be done with young children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the misuse cases, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the reminder" My brother of the Pope "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesemann," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is written in the 440-page report, which the German lawyer Ulrich Weber ordered by the Bistum Regensburg has presented to the Enlightenment?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and the early 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said that Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. were used in many cases physical and psychological violence."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment for the students was even more intense."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, might even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal has relieved in his opinion with the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence against protection of protection at the Regensburger Domspatzen "," gives a conflicting picture of domain master Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students raise his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who became tangible to the listener when a domspatz brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you are making the effort and reading the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in general at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Violence excesses at the pre-school took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to discard it at best, to experience it too late or have first clarifications not taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium's gymnasium, on which it worked, was felt by virtually all the interviewees as" "salvation", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the broad majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony," "sincere", "" "sincere", "" "competent", "" "competent" "and" "understanding", "as extremely good-natured teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and" "always surrounded by children's grapes". ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to fractures."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he himself admitted, deeply deplored and apologized for years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such methods of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us born in front of 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually goes in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and violent excesses at the preschool, Bagatella is admittedly."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders if it's not related to his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed upon him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, many people who have never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in recent years, problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees" qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions. "</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also put any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">"not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults, claiming to be entrusted to the Cathedral Master."</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "said one of the wounded representative for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if not even parents and siblings trusted, then certainly not a choir director, who, however, professionally had been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the scrape students evaluate Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a asked disciple formulated it in such a way: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see... no case in which he had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it seems to him... Buben are more intrusive or clearer or even more likely to have opened than to their parents, dormitory leaders, confidence teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk about sex with him... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report comes to the very clear result:" that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed within the scope of the study. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any involvement."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these wary crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" violent excesses "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "obstructing" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: yes, this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed with a huge reporting of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that is again an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there it is clean separately: between the primary school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let's say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful examiner pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were regularly slipped and maligned, and among them horribly suffered, all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions had to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the gymnasium gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this was, as most of the witnesses pointed out, the subject of" pre-school "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims have estimated the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, associate positive memories with him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most, remains the reproach to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently swallow the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he pointed out that in the pre-school, the test was still practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as examiners had long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers were exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This just isn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the punishment for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said yes, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" "Case of Anachronism", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past, according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was in the pre-school of adversity and violence to innocent children's soul, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so ear-eyes and the hair and ears to draw, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger period has given Georg Ratzinger in talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, that the domain cats played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not yet concede that he led there a rigorous regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without requiring unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone, the rebellious boys are no longer doing a big singer and before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and repeatedly experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believing and heartfelt people, of whom one could not imagine that he could only do something a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emery, regularly contact him, visit him, he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"today, most of the cats are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strong father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect for respect, to which they still look up and which they downright."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clear: everything you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcoming this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the start-up would command a 93-year-old man, who acquired great merits and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
