28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local mall . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia of San Francisco , distributed the geri@@ atic medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank , who previously worked as cook in Boston , held his dream job as a chef in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were shocked and destroyed by the ground .
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia gave that Frank was first living in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gal@@ icia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; his way to connect with his family was to cook us always something to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any sort of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the flood .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has information about the case , will be asked to call for the initi@@ ator of the SF@@ PD with the number 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 . &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers , or get stuck from outside labels which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather snow@@ ing . &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current cosm@@ opol@@ itan .
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend their time at home , in front of the TV with a loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it says in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she brings the question according to the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as an all @-@ educ@@ ating mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of change at the beach with some colleagues . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted in the fast gal@@ lop back home to the feed trou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
&quot; he let himself lead his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not fall for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports helmet handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyram@@ id .
awards do not lack the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting offspring for decades .
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 further outstanding sports@@ men , the double US mast winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society emig@@ rated to the jumping Stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreements - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are , however , in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
the idea of the role of the state .
&quot; in the case of doubt , Tr@@ ump aims to keep small and cau@@ tious about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax@@ ish the economy to death and to regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely return regul@@ ars , and he is strongly committed to far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , states : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes would increase for the rich , she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are saying almost the same . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , there could be further internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and restart coal mining in the United States .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in protected areas in so far , to termin@@ ate the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton on the other hand wants to extend and claim the renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only with the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ al trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the US does not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid for better , calls for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage needs r@@ ink , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics face him , so the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , at least demanding from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women , who are fle@@ eing alone , almost to everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social relief services in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it has been officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a bear@@ er of hope . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many steal secretly from it because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , murder victims , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
on the run this continues .
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs call for a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north , traum@@ ati@@ zed , she appreci@@ ates . &quot;
some of the children were certainly not voluntary .
many women are so accustomed to nothing to say .
or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big .
&quot; because they often don &apos;t know to help , there are more accommodations just for them , demands b@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction , some answers with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone women alone are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - und Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some common underground floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or will men and women stay together , it can - perpet@@ ual - violence against women come . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection , can be read at the urge to go to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands for new labour struggles
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labour struggles in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour struggles from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC testi@@ fied that the ministers had failed to respond to the wor@@ rying about the contract .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted for the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the conclusion that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In consideration of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal motion to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour struggles which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that assist@@ ants of this year quar@@ terly argue , the first general failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of B@@ MA assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions , which were advised by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students that the contract should be advantageous and adopted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forced to be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes receipt of his Turkish opponent in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace , I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most . &quot;
&quot; there was the strike , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin sm@@ iled sm@@ iles , and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for its restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved so badly as if anything bad happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
heroes of Ple@@ ven Com@@ mem@@ or@@ ated in Moscow W@@ re@@ ath@@ es from the Russian Ministry of Defense and Bulgarian Embassy were laid at the pedi@@ ment of the memorial church .
Putin deno@@ unced and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia .
&quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
building the etr@@ acker again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
&quot; the serious accus@@ ations of leading officials were that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had prof@@ ited from illegal oil trade in Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the ap@@ ology that he wanted to hear from the President Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been enth@@ r@@ alled at a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat of almost his ministry last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late ais@@ le attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television projected cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , since its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power is regarded as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge of the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , Russian head of state won a bonus for the fact that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is surely a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent , as an analy@@ st once described to me , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and treated badly and now alli@@ ed themselves . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents had said that they would not even have gr@@ asp@@ ed the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately denied it to answer a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey sh@@ ou@@ ted the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Directors , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office role according to the Bank &apos;s CEO . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumers &quot; brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised Head@@ quarters and the Stock Qu@@ otation to Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customers who will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he distributed the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand of the RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand as well as to the brand , among which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
&quot; R@@ BS has already announced that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves a 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market at Pre@@ dil@@ ection &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British prize at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reached the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ek when he reco@@ vers victory on pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career plans &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thr@@ illed fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already scored 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in GB , Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years of winner , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British Strip since two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulty in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doubts and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50 years of age .
Russian Putin fired Stab@@ sch@@ ef Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ issed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of Putin &apos;s closest trust .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered Ivan@@ ov &apos;s discharge from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a pro@@ xy since 2012 , became his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , it means ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Head of the Government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state , regarding bills of laws and controls to implement your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov has been one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants for a long time , and works like he for the Soviet Secret Service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff was back at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say to me - compl@@ aining about complaints for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov &apos;s second term president could be President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of office would viol@@ ate the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .

puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish might be sand@@ als , spread by a fountain of foun@@ tains . &quot;
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross @-@ dres@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ine ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; business minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today , and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross @-@ dres@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total deck @-@ deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high@@ - and civil engineering .
&quot; after installing the last section of the road and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the gap between the north or the north . &quot;
this was achieved by drag@@ ging the northern jet@@ ty bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; swing , as the toler@@ ances that the team works , were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
&quot; three men were lucky to be alive , after being thrown off by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station killed 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved out of their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat was around and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ man &apos;s boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and suspended at a boy@@ friend without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water were lucky to be injured and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boot engine had an emergency stop , but this triggered the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
&quot; today , someone has wo@@ ken about these men . &quot;
seriously hurt - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had received the keys to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ free perpetr@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and in the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
he then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street she met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds up favorable apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; investors should be taken seriously in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to bad news that Braunschweig would lose almost 1300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; at the next meeting , the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; concept of action &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the big issue in the town hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas , but as much as 20 per cent of the flats as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing loan program , which will cost millions of costs and still needs to be financed , will provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder constraints for investors .
&quot; despite this , so Brat@@ mann , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market began . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is uncle@@ ar whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the programme does not yet exist : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how can one compens@@ ate for the loss of more than 1300 favourable dwell@@ ings that will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
there will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning @-@ based spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be bought out@@ going ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of getting flats back into price fixing . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
&quot; because in the west city , the end of the year is running . &quot;
about 1800 apartments could be picked up there back into the price binding for affordable apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West City is again dras@@ tically increased , one can be removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no concentration of social weaknesses in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be in the boat . &quot;
this has concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their free time watching TV screens , has been su@@ ed by many over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s emerged from it ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the track and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , the game has led to a considerable rise in steps which the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of sequ@@ enti@@ ous people , which train every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data on performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; on de@@ af ears , because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look el@@ usive . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonder at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as usual , there are also m@@ ür@@ er@@ ous game @-@ spo@@ ils that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is it supposed to be ?
it has happened a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be followed by time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , more active and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bal@@ es is on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the floor .
on whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympic winner .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ asi@@ um en@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ camp title and increased the gap between herself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; the American act@@ resses Simone Bil@@ e tur@@ nt on the floating beam during the individual campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ hah is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and a total of the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end . &quot;
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a domin@@ ates the last three years , 15 world champ@@ ionships , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic winner of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it awa@@ ited her last examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual campaign of women at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ al took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ hah insi@@ sted on having never planned the future , it is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no coinci@@ dence .
&quot; this girl , who adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition , a series of victories that will hold as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led by two rot@@ ations , the picture ble@@ w . &quot;
Bal@@ lo@@ way and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ hah holds the title of the World Champion .
&quot; she repeated again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam , and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ais@@ man embr@@ aced her gently as she expected her final g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed on Bil@@ a shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book , became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance R@@ ais@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , which is called by the Americans &quot; Grand@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil practice she threw the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;

police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ derer when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and afterwards flew with another vehicle to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police announced that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult cas@@ u@@ alties . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting has led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks within four months and two were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects have used multiple vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which ended half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder over which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t . &quot;
I don &apos;t .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has embar@@ ked on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with help of a help@@ desk .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life nor he can still not speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
it can run and cycle with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has thought for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him character language , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
&quot; micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto ev@@ okes the emotional price of a uncertain future .
&quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know yet .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Louis@@ iana , Mississi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ area floo@@ ds in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday . it is expected all Saturday over with more rainf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Mississi@@ ppi floo@@ ded its banks and threatened with large @-@ area floo@@ ds after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported . &quot;
the governor of Louis@@ iana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louis@@ iana until Saturday .
the weather service was sil@@ enced that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood early warning system was deployed on Friday while it continued raining in the Mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Louis@@ iana , are likely to reach record levels all over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be floo@@ ded in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are flowing slowly over the rivers only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the River Tick@@ v@@ w , south of the Mississi@@ ppi &apos;s national border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still pl@@ ung@@ ed people from floo@@ ding in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Mississi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were amongst those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose over night strongly . &quot;
he said that he would have warned him another son @-@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water f@@ lowed and pouring in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years where she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said the &quot; &quot; floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; had rapidly spread , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer came near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been very well @-@ weigh@@ ed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities reported that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ated in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by the flood . &quot;
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond emergency lod@@ gings were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the flood of water and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants to take part , who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Mississi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ess said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be floo@@ ded , but on Friday they were not reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I saw water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; en@@ riches by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at the hospital in his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was en@@ qu@@ en@@ ched by balls , &quot; &quot; distributed his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot;
I simply cannot believe this .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is expected to recover again .
he would have to start the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car , together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , se@@ wed the Tat@@ ort . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; so there seems to have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants involved , who were involved very actively , &quot; distributed police @-@ p@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and police reports , according to reports , the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ r@@ ack@@ et on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police still searches for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I present at the gymn@@ asi@@ um in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jewish is and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ kin , round off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected but master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual campaign for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see some sports classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie launched all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to get it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts come primarily in private gy@@ ms that are maintained by parents who pay for training , setup , travel , clothing , competition , and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these associations , the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes , since they started their gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the congregations in inn@@ umer@@ able , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easier access training . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics of 20 years ago .
&quot; during my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you get so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants would like to organize more strikes after rejected by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ting &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assist@@ ants who voted in a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July H@@ unt had revealed plans to force the treaty and said that the N@@ HS had found itself in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and would be det@@ ri@@ mental to any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants are expected to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend activities to improve the maintenance of these times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA committee for assist@@ ants informed last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce and allow it to treat all physicians . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out . &quot;
&quot; efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes through talks have to take part in the government , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; this happened in a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made about it last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now , lift up the condition and address the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to provide doctors on the strike chain covering . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants a better week @-@ end remun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors , who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of the N@@ HS employee , urged the assist@@ ants to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer states : &quot; &quot; labour @-@ fighting measures do not reach anything of the only little , but already poll@@ ute teams and service providers and prepare the patients , pa@@ leg@@ ers and their families only worry , distress and dis@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns about the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vacation and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ pro Tag@@ - medication , which can reduce heart attack risk &quot;
&quot; thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after the authorities have been advised to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time . &quot;
the t@@ ying medicine Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form pl@@ aque .
&quot; when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the intake of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ctions and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the effectiveness and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
the culture of the political Cor@@ rect@@ ness is bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing in Muslim areas .
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office
&quot; a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored , like a devastating government report today . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , former cabinet member , pic@@ ks up the police , poll@@ s and town halls to ignore the evidence of electoral mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , which is now an antagon@@ ist , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabins to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead an identification with themselves , in order to prove their identity at elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must merely call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable inks to the finger of a person , when they give off their vote to prevent someone el@@ ects twice . &quot;
&quot; whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against suff@@ rage , but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in East London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man had to be enth@@ r@@ alled after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person el@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter @-@ election , when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guidance of evidence to prove identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Ban@@ glad@@ esh backgrounds . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity in regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists process stamp documents to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters to vote for your ID card .
&quot; do not use removable inks on the finger of a person , as soon as they have left their voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic review of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic selection of letters .
ban that political activists process complete correspondence and envel@@ opes from local elections .
the police give the authority to set off barriers to bal@@ lot stations .
a change in legislation that facilitates an accus@@ ation for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
photographer ban on bal@@ lot stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the bal@@ lot stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that the staff rule out that voters go alone in the voting booth .
&quot; Sir Eric runs through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; ast@@ o@@ unding , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty of due to the high requirements in criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the non @-@ effective &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ encies of the town hall . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of suff@@ rage and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
mad to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic sports@@ men in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , beyond the border and the band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ cat@@ chy of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by no means the only one to have gold fighting Ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , fli@@ cking on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olymp@@ ic@@ icles , which show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the fighter and the wolf : team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the cycle track , many people on the internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no big simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; told Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess it seems to be a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ pers Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her grand , expressive eyes is to go through to Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an as a double tran@@ sit@@ ter for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh have been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption actor
&quot; another continued comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ ons floating in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the Americans attacked Adrian from fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : foot@@ star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of its comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese flo@@ ats &quot; &quot; as low went down &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was turned off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle floating st@@ aff@@ el had his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been clin@@ ched on board in the comment@@ ator team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , he went as low as a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese flo@@ ats in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming arm 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers in all Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows at the fin@@ als 4 x 200m Fre@@ estyle floating aff@@ le for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the cri@@ tique of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many spoke to him &quot;
&quot; Twitter users did not stay back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald was , &quot;
&quot; another Twitter username Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like rac@@ ists . # disgu@@ sted .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming performance was aired . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ happy chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who responded to the emer@@ al@@ ds about Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users , who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ don@@ ald &quot;
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and delivered a message .
we regret it sincer@@ ely that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience and our folklore in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympic program , he said . &quot;
&quot; I was referring to the power of the float , and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about woman tried in the middle of the store sham@@ el@@ essly under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman went out of her clothes in the midst of a landmark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at how she looked at it , pulled her off and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
you continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the landmark business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman tried to under@@ wear the under@@ wear , she got rid of her and left her business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she once again placed them on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she did not fall back and went out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she watched someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take shelter with home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to draw the pieces of clothing from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and figur@@ ing out that another woman had her and pulled out and washed her again .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against fire attacks by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from front or back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; hit him with your knees in the bar and turn , while the att@@ acker falls before pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; for att@@ ackers who are approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist them so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; shift the weight to the gun at the same time and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and turn the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it prepar@@ es Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that a smo@@ ker is the saf@@ est to over@@ pass your money , unless you are a Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;

&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought of det@@ ecting the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a traction toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to physicians and medical experts on the promotion of gut bacteria as well as their own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left behind what he ta@@ sted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public rail@@ ways to stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was in any case justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test line showed a lumin@@ ometric count of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison to this , the lumin@@ ous number of hands of fresh washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after their L@@ umin@@ ometer count was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o have produced the &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; This comes close to the worst thing I have put in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
&quot; I &apos;m not going to check here , because it is disgu@@ sting inside . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of Mil@@ k Products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New Categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we conducted mad Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming who ended up saying that we said &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how they are associated with the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who was directing the film , added : &quot; let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had told him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to blame them and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am happy that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film .

&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys prior to del@@ og@@ ging social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ usion with a damage of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shock@@ ing employees of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls dism@@ issed holes , wooden boards were rou@@ gh@@ ened , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that terror , which had inf@@ lic@@ ted the family , consisted of street fights with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive cri@@ es , strikes and flights . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn apart . &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner by force this week by giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
&quot; the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , saying that their lives were made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They were not ashamed of anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously committed to us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
I hope this development will provide con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress resi@@ ding in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the floor
workers of the house administration will now have to wi@@ den gar@@ bage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police introduced a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ it@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine @-@ penalty after having found guilty of a drug of class B in trade fores@@ ight .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police say they will del@@ to@@ g@@ ze ten@@ ants , which do not stick to the house rules &quot;
&quot; Angela C@@ row was informed by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , that del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not cling to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without repro@@ ach , as well as those who have been damaged by such a conduct , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal moved to panic after an open @-@ fle@@ dged military jet over@@ flies the beach
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal saved the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ g@@ is@@ i@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on airplane of air strikes put an incredible storm
&quot; the Air Force provided that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk occurred . &quot;
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a flying jet over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers sprang up , understand@@ ably , to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without seeing what came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew really deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ yo added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were translated into panic when the airplane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deeply
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that due to the bad visibility of the area surrounding area fires a little deeper than usual flew , however , the air@@ strikes insi@@ sted that security at no time was je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on the island of Madeira came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot had to fly as deeply due to circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which restri@@ cts its vision . &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup ward off the FC Sevilla , the return game increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the dou@@ bl@@ eman must disp@@ ense with the under@@ pinn@@ ed cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who compet@@ ed with Brazil as the Olympic football tournament . &quot;
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is missing .
&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which Bar@@ ca &apos;s request was at least clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compet@@ ed for the status as a number one . &quot;
&quot; so far , coach Luis En@@ rique did not reno@@ unce a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other cont@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 in the trial of S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really appreciate convincing .
&quot; in Sevilla , again , the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid has to be di@@ gest@@ ed and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;

MA Long in your own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old conquered on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale to his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) .
&quot; the world rank first won the &quot; Golden Grand Sl@@ am &quot; with success at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tournament and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the end game and made the title one another .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ chin@@ ese at the top Olympics bar@@ gain was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left on the plate alone , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no c@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; they had moved back to the grand@@ stand , and left their cont@@ ests in a fair competition alone . &quot;
&quot; the Mat@@ ches up here , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang had said tor@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly single @-@ sided .
MA had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that he set the pace on the record , leaving Z@@ hang down only a total of 13 points . &quot;
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma they did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
&quot; nevertheless , nevertheless , there were enough stunning ballo@@ ons to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had bred a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; &quot; ultimately &quot; &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump gives ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire , usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , expressed something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success are now growing in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; wrong reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sh@@ ook . &quot;
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds sh@@ ov@@ el
Utah is usually a secure bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance , which is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk .
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; in case it is not rich for him , for reasons of political correctness , this is in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to withdraw funds to support his campaign , he should not present a better survey . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidate of the Republi@@ can candidate for Congress to intervene more strongly under the arms . &quot;
Olympia : three @-@ day sc@@ am at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
&quot; after the second dop@@ ing affair , Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened with the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan official said that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , submitted a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported by the team leader Ken@@ ias by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to make his own investigations a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will undertake a review , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; declared Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the athletes , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was over 800 meters in Beijing World Cup in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending D@@ oping tests against money pay@@ outs of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was report@@ edly arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing experiments .
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets laid out by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was noted that especially athletes of Kenya and Russia were taken into the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports from the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; at last , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya , how he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ art was surface @-@ covered and systematically mut@@ ed . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Mary a youth mare .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ am@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls with sad@@ ness to her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it &apos;s musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ am@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ertor@@ ican went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as powerful today as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family had heard about her death a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had for@@ s@@ aken the war @-@ torn country and returned to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people think to ever make this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from the East of London entered a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sultan &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow . &quot;
Rei@@ d says Clinton will stay as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have been blocking Scotland &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not spoken to Clinton , whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not provide rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Republi@@ can blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also noted Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants neck cal@@ ender for &quot; women and for men &quot;
&quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats Magazine &quot; &quot; is working together with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring the Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us early this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that the Calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the publication of the cal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at an open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass flight
&quot; those who don &apos;t miss and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects to flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice with tens of thousands of prot@@ ectors from Turkey .
&quot; in the medium term , even &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh austerity of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when Erdo@@ gan &apos;s regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already passed Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ alties in the course of months , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey are fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the fro@@ sted put@@ sch , even secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added . &quot;
many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the withdrawal of the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the German Federal Government demanded that &quot; as sharp@@ ly as Austria is positioned against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot;
&quot; also in Germany , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is taking place . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the brand mark as a Gü@@ len @-@ practitioner destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who don &apos;t miss and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Turks have already placed the largest group of asylum rights recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all members of the asylum seek@@ er ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) were eligible . &quot;
&quot; in this survey you will not find the victims of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get out of the summer election campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; because more stupid than so far , it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and land elections - this bit@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the poll@@ s , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; the most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so you can &apos;t choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on the end of voices , only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again to pass an election campaign to the people over them . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say this at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; exciting is how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off , and what remains at the end of the coalition . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and Prime Minister since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous electoral campaign , one can see from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as it was his legendary word @-@ car@@ er , Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Merkel the blame on the flo@@ wering of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We are creating this , &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which now probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major shows ; Merkel Bundest@@ ag@@ lus@@ coni is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the audience didn &apos;t agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other German states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it too bad , nobody from other corners of Germany , even to listen to Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , so says Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noticed that in the country , it would crum@@ ble the basis that it must be very strict , to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are on the left side , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the widths of the country there is hardly any present . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called up his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had even clearly gained 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should create the leap into the parliament . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and lay their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; calls the President of Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on track search for domestic stimul@@ ants among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg seas and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : Gast@@ stätten S@@ ail@@ ure under Sper@@ m
&quot; at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and finish only against 8 o &apos;clock , there are always praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything rather z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October .
&quot; the reci@@ proc@@ ity of the responsible persons responsible for the construction work will also be v@@ owed , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation entran@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday is immig@@ rated to the south and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been cancelled , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has resum@@ ed , the traffic situation within the town has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asi@@ ve traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy chief executive director Florian King for the transport management of the re@@ organization . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ throughput Street , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sne@@ aks were looking for and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to a shortage of heavy trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits have not been met , the municipality also demanded an increase in the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made himself aware of the situation . &quot;
two to three per minute have been da@@ zz@@ led .
the fastest race was at 77 Hours in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; however , that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to revenue bur@@ sts , everyone can look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; i.e. for other companies , has hardly any consequences for the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; the running customer is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; sales revenues are &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street lubrication was thrown back two years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his associates .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ issed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the host@@ ess would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it also has to bear the dis@@ advantages that arise through the rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous is handled . &quot;
&quot; in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests are now less often passing by due to complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also nice somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; that its root climate comes back after the end of the rehabilitation work , there is no doubt that G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ term history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly screw@@ ed down . &quot;
&quot; according to the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presents a huge security package . &quot;
but what has a D@@ ul@@ ancy status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his suggestions are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the introduction of his new security package . &quot;
they do not demand anybody .
&quot; other , further points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I took part in it . &quot;
&quot; as the Interior Minister , however , he was at the forefront of results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cr@@ acking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU specifications on passenger data and ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will launch a second conc@@ entri@@ c run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to pose a threat to terrorist groups and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this , he still considers this to be reasonable and does not require any chances at the coalition partner . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are partly in themselves : he is planning quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ting people from deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a safety check .
&quot; in case of cancellation for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away to veil their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
man@@ ches also has an un@@ break@@ able effect and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - in the im@@ balance of patient , for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures . &quot;
&quot; and things which the people were deeply concerned , could not be om@@ itted even in election times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; the attacks in the neighbourhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot;
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in place with the issue of internal security .
in the past few days there was a high rise between the two parties .
&quot; only a quar@@ rel argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security @-@ political collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a revers@@ al from the double pass , he does not hold anything . &quot;
we have finished the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it is not reasonable .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he had constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners , and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must still be revealed . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could cause disputes .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to strengthen itself on the topic of internal security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming g@@ lim@@ pf@@ lich .
&quot; despite diesel conditions , the delivery numbers are increasing worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it is running smoothly .
&quot; in the recall action , there are vor@@ tices around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts the second half @-@ year with the deliveries .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the Nu@@ clear @-@ brand VW weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sale as the company listed in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
in the home market Germany the deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
&quot; sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought the weaker figures from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , a purchase restra@@ int has been given in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus in be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is further g@@ lim@@ pf@@ ingly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition minus 0.9 per cent is to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler continued to conduct sales plans . &quot;
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million cars for conversion into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the reconstruction of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car auer places the customer a &quot; &quot; guaranteed certificate &quot; &quot; after the conversion , but not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee of upgraded diesel models .
this would have been confirmed by VW @-@ representatives last Monday in the Federal Ministry of Transport ( Federal Ministry of Transport ) .
the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as its name was in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example half a year after the conversion , for example , customers can come to a workshop about half a year after the conversion , and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in the interest of customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , to ensure uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as it was said . &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands sufficient savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Mr Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks talks about a single incident and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; normal savings should &quot; &quot; not be afraid to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they need to pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee demands Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he kept 40 million euros for some time , which could be up@@ lifted from one day to the other , and which he could not use . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can not lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
the cost is now proceeding according to the poll@@ uter pays principle .
&quot; letting the cash simply lie in the saf@@ es of the Raiff@@ eisen Bank , it would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear alone , &quot; &quot; business @-@ economic &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thür@@ inger Volk@@ s- und Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank @-@ Fili@@ ale 2014 made head@@ lines with pun@@ ches for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect that private customers have to pay comprehensive loans for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a client@@ ele that is a bit more luxuri@@ ant from the property . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; if it pays for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , Gen@@ ossen@@ schafts@@ bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and business@@ men live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no other banks are known to the cooperative association of Bavaria , which calcul@@ ates a compensation set for deposits of private customers , &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the German Volks@@ banks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
destination plates : who wants to buy vinyl records ?
lonely men of middle @-@ age love records .
&quot; before you come to the comment part , to sow it under the pseud@@ onym of non @-@ aven@@ ue men &apos;s middle aged with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multi@@ fac@@ eted resurrection of records is not on a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but rather to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely number of buyers . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wil@@ dly congrat@@ ulate before I stop , hold my hands and say something like &apos; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to evaluate their age and mind through observation . &quot;
&quot; Glasgow , 55 , by S@@ ister Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , shown above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford , when she appeared and re @-@ selling items he sold when he was young and pl@@ agu@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke , and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers , which he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also notices a new wave of people affected by the media pump , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers assumed imp@@ etus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound plate envel@@ opes , from objects that call up happy ju@@ gen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is like that with many people .
it is a simple way to deal spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee is but@@ ton@@ ing from a record pile . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet listened . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I fell through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; trophy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here just recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ like , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player .
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly enter . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I enter . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s newest synthes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ be@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ps from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks odd , but nag@@ ging psychological trau@@ mas are hard to realize when you stand next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window shopping as a big shopping .
&quot; it does not deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I seem to show the jeans hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group themselves for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a cross ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some are so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most for luxury items like records . &quot;
&quot; even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , have not taken into account the large number of female collector &apos;s in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they do not spend their th@@ urs@@ day tomorrow with the st@@ rolling through panels of the Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing view of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter , that sticks over the shoulders of nothing of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French Court ref@@ uses offer on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
&quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should settle 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that would take a fire and san@@ itation risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely transparent . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to protect the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it stated that the closure &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two auxiliary organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants under@@ estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers throughout the summer . &quot;
despite Olympia dis@@ appointment : Martin remains comb@@ ative
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin does not want to get down . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I hon@@ estly say it &apos;s hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he had to analyse in silence the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the qualifying World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will take a look at everything we have changed in recent times .
&quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time timer world champion , who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday . &quot;

the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am specialised in this hobby .
&quot; how much money is flowing for the tak@@ eover , Microsoft announced on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer until January and has already more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; you can watch other games while playing , but also intervene . &quot;
&quot; for example , they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment . &quot;
the Spiel@@ er@@ esis Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
&quot; on the way to global media event , Facebook is supposed to help . &quot;
the advertising industry already hor@@ des .
&quot; the staff of the Start @-@ ups , which had its headquarters previously in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to Microsoft headquarters in California Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department all around the Xbox console . &quot;
the market of live streaming of video games is growing rapidly .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new fl@@ ashes are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic advertising trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at accident areas where it is too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to re@@ peti@@ tive bridges with temporary Tem@@ p , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a long @-@ lasting mobile design can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days in continuous measuring operations , the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be collected across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as drive messages by time , travel strips and vehicle classes can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ powered state , the trailer can be connected to the manufacturer with every car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also sweat @-@ proof outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic data in different German states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with the new technique : recently France ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 units last year . &quot;
great Britain pic@@ ks silver in 7 @-@ s rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold wins
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance during the 7 @-@ year rug@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro stage . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , back @-@ back , liner run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on her in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began to mar@@ ry and let the attacks of GB@@ s have fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. on , as if you were running in bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a prot@@ ru@@ ding T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua got a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play 7 , while GB still lear@@ ns . &quot;
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to half time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game worked for a long time in favor of the South sailors whose fans sang , wav@@ ed flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whist@@ le sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB kick@@ ed sm@@ ashed in the tur@@ f . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bu@@ cks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no more remote gold than those playing and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard sal@@ ts that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she row@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax @-@ woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 39.@@ - un@@ sh@@ attered commitment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not reflected in the way of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hel@@ pers who make up the difference , and no one was able to make any difference to the trainer , who didn &apos;t know if he was diagnosed with cancer before 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spread everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ spreading morning a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who as Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment was in use in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer of the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began closing , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something T@@ oll@@ es .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding with your own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months to conc@@ eive , that I am an Olympic winner . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the Managing Director of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exemplary . &quot;
a small Francon@@ ian drinking water association serves as a model for the large water producers .
so it was some time ago in the original on a contribution to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Rund@@ fun@@ ks .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Francon@@ ia hon@@ ours the co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he was now reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 locations and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ heimer , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chair@@ person , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a Water@@ man in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband since 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched themselves from the pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organization activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency sets at weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she named the commissioning and initi@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high tank ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the ponds of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always recorded new innovations , because water lif@@ ter and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faith@@ fully , reliable and correct service for 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has invested with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association , and he has lived the water purpose association , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for Nit@@ rat@@ lowering in front of the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia district . &quot;
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s part praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ ery go@@ al@@ keeper and he was a faithful cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose of the purpose . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the rup@@ ture in the high tank near Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high hop@@ per from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the Dr@@ inking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who will follow Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s succession .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots to partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.@@ m .
&quot; the man has inv@@ oked himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly punished . &quot;
&quot; now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is approximately 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
who sees Sven S. shall call the 110 .
the police talk about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the police in Lu@@ e@@ beck wanted to make no information about the day @-@ to @-@ day or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a person was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing machine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say anymore , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special service mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - Flash@@ back for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from green electricity production , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transformation in the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) said the &quot; West@@ deutscher Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the last two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission initially had planned to ask the steel producers , the gases coming from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption , to ask for the check@@ out . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with the Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , all an E@@ EG lev@@ elling unit is 20 percent . &quot;
but also these will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity production .
&quot; in this way , the status quo is largely attributed to the previous control . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation was further wor@@ sen@@ ing when the world &apos;s largest producer of China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers launch Chinese steel corporations pricing dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation was somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel have effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have accumulated . &quot;
uncle@@ ar is how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have been more stagn@@ ant again . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude closing statements of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced less than six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , such as steel trading on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the quantity produced now went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good in her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors like from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; because often social and family structures dis@@ solve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; because in doing so , senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
anyone who demands his lungs regularly is not as fast as the pu@@ ste in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; for elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people awak@@ ens a lot of memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people lose themselves to long @-@ lying events with dementia . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head is also required a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people who live alone , practice not only focusing on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I have a long time for something , I will be better and watch over me - this experience rein@@ forces . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , he advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; one does not sing alone - for 50 singing people , who hears there when a sound goes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior &apos;s choir , you can simply join . &quot;
many cities also provide over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet search . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es h@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on the scre@@ e of the young
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover what effect the ru@@ by of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ ch@@ ew@@ ing also caused the males not cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ ch@@ ew@@ ing of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in great need as scientists found out of the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , tom@@ cat also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ch@@ ew@@ ing of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the livestock breeding of the MH@@ H .
&quot; they were pre @-@ played for a herd of little ones , taken for three minutes from the saus@@ age box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens who were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers hold their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned out faster to the loudspeaker when this calls were played out of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were more sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski pic@@ ks up with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r was issued an arrest warrant against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey is again taking place an important football match . &quot;
&quot; in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; the government , the daily life of normal citizens , should not be affected by the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the emergency state after the fall attempt in July . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it will not stop in front of football . &quot;
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r , the Prosec@@ utor made an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ k@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , however , most Turks do not have any effects on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be completed on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Club &apos;s Club Bes@@ ic@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in view of dramatic experiences in history , what the Gro@@ s of Turks inv@@ ade in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; winner of the &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; winner , it will especially be on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; according to his athle@@ tic value , the Cologne based in the season ended : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club . &quot;
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory .
the magazine &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy to his crew .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; in the Europa League bid f@@ arewell . &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it reached only rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ic@@ tas the year &apos;s year was better .
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ retta king . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at the same time , the Gom@@ ez , signed by the AC in Florence , had announced only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the attempted coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say it , &quot; &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the temp@@ est would have to be willing to reno@@ unce around one third of his year &apos;s estimated 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have even medals chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has already been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa should not start in Rio .
other survi@@ ving athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had su@@ ed her start right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ essly kick@@ ed out and bu@@ ed out at her start ( 100 m breast ) . &quot;
it offered a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scenery : with a super@@ imposed smile she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her performance .
&quot; when it was established that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; however , there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figur@@ ines in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had already been locked for two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9,80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m Rel@@ ay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month lock after it was detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she suffered severe tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ decent intake and was bar@@ red for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ as .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months . &quot;
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ heads , Belarus ) : probably hardly an ath@@ lete had been recognized as many medals later . &quot;
&quot; so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone . &quot;
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 title for testosterone abuse .
&quot; the Bronze Med@@ al , also recognised as the 2008 Olympic Games , returned to CAS due to a judgment of the International Athle@@ tics Tribunal . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world cat@@ ch@@ anc@@ ellor and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin have only been positively tested in May but must still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence of taking a prohibited food supplement was found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell off and ran off on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand has been in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered cutting cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the vacation island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he are also Austrian citizens , it is still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , police were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three low@@ lands and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , two spr@@ inkl@@ ers were again high , a further man was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; when det@@ on@@ ating in the vicinity of the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police information . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the spr@@ inkl@@ er had gone into the air in a flower @-@ be@@ et in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , there were several injured in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the southwest coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; said Ar@@ tem@@ er@@ al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but it is likely to be the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , explained that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were put . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities have received secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and the places . &quot;
still be uncle@@ ar what group is hiding behind the attacks .
&quot; the police showed their officials all over the country to rein@@ force security around major government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not address tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in , there is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; following the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( Level 3 ) was responsible for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after con@@ front@@ ations between the security forces and the Muslim populations , there will be no necessary journeys into these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military a big influence over the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country progres@@ sed towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps himself too good to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting the grip of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , a popular Hind@@ u @-@ shr@@ ine killed 20 people in Bangkok , most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; has come into the spotlight of the Federal Office of Constitutional Affairs .
&quot; after several state offices , the constitutional guards in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; identity movement &apos; cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants in Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Ma@@ ate , his authority has worked closely with the state offices in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group wherever they stand , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the do@@ omed Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ sed advertisement for your own thing .
the propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , there were reports of contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional complaint , possible contacts of this type are only relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ aß said he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler group .
&quot; it can be quite possible that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee shei@@ men or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of squar@@ em@@ or@@ ism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many attacks on the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
&quot; many of the suspic@@ ious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed beforehand with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olymp@@ ian or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the courage@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended his course with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather its not exactly sporting figure which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ presented countries well @-@ known .
&quot; as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel der W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; made it funny with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only hit the 100 m Fre@@ estyle with a minute and almost five seconds , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a subur@@ b of more than 100 m Fre@@ estyle alone . &quot;
&quot; at that time , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

jump sees the dro@@ pping election situation not so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been an alternative video . &quot;
he then asc@@ ends into the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump lost the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; in the end , it will be either folding , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the US TV station CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; in the case for him , at the end , for reasons of political correctness , this is in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; so he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post increases in trading with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously large .
the post is planning to sell her electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
&quot; in short , the Group plans to launch trade with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the Post wants to offer their electric v@@ ans on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; we want to enter a third party in the sale , &quot; said a post or@@ ator on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been examining whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , even to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ Management Board Jürgen Ger@@ des said , there are always inquiries about tra@@ des@@ people . &quot;
&quot; following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ production facility , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ da announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and in the long run a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we complete the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GR@@ P leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures

&quot; at the end of the year , G@@ FR@@ P Executive Board intends to leave the company . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; as early as 1 September , the management board of the Management Board will take over the former board member Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger , distributed the company . &quot;
he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; as a reason for the tail@@ oring , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
&quot; for details , a company spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ ende , it was called on Friday , with the shareholders , last@@ ly , the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures initiated years ago . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the quot@@ a so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
sales of € 36@@ 1.2 million were 6.1 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s level .
sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros decreased by 3.4 percent for the first half of the year .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into sc@@ rub@@ bing in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their indications , had to ev@@ ade a counter truck that was partly on the opposite lane . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency car came to the accident location on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ finished travellers were brought back to the Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic metre of wast@@ ewater are from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2.10 euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( currently 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater fee will be increased at the latest once corresponding improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a higher @-@ rate calculation , the wast@@ ewater fee in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the Food Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , they found shelter for these wast@@ ewater facilities . &quot;
&quot; due to legal grounds , the Kaz@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities free of charge . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg have to reach deeper in the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , also over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period should be equ@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt founded the gra@@ ding fee hikes in all three wast@@ ewater facilities , with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water treatment , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , due to the low distribution basis for example expenditure for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water flow is slightly decl@@ ining in all three systems . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; the complex in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ewater treatment plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping station Wel@@ ding@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and the first sewage treatment facility had to be installed after nearly 20 years , the sewage sl@@ ud@@ ge was dispos@@ ed and an additional ventilation facility was installed in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs came to be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made clear that at the low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully sm@@ ashed .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the aforementioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious according to stone houses , especially since one cannot extend the supply area of the wast@@ ewater treatment association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal in order to not extend these facilities because they are defici@@ ent facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were booked .
annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , compared with the previous month , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; transport ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
&quot; snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies each day . &quot;
all mis@@ prints arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week several users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth , and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow @-@ face . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether these repeated contro@@ versy sur@@ faced a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the indign@@ ation were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , the filter reminded of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote in an e @-@ mail , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos , that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and said . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contra@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filtering effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not safe , but that the yellow face was pulled into the down@@ ward extre@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ kite .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in . &quot;
and Snap@@ chat &apos;s big audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ ed in the breed than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ chat &apos;s filters created a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rac@@ ist controversi@@ es reflect lack of diversity in the inclusion practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the most part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely ignored Snap@@ chat . &quot;
the company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel manager who concentrated on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; for their part , Z@@ hu said they will make their Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership distor@@ ts IS@@ IS sec@@ rec@@ y information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed post @-@ intelligence information to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions were allowed on site , reported a committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Army Committee , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Ar@@ med Forces Committee , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command Intelligence &apos;s analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , shortly cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information that typically had been sent out by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders regularly reported a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism , as the actual conditions on site were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government tips given under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Releases , statements and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than it was the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com applicant publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s tips changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations .
&quot; in addition , further investigations in the Cent@@ Com are being carried out by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the news service committee on Thursday published their own findings which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essi@@ vely restricted trial for the preparation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; announced the Supreme Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaging the mor@@ ale among analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little space for differ@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats did not give any evidence of intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st in regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tors , which were received after complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave in a statement that the Department of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the general inspec@@ tions are still under way . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; but the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the Secret Information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes between more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts a little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to indicate that there were no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group against the refin@@ eries dict@@ ated by the Islamic State , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the Legisl@@ ative because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA win fourth consecutive match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates over Japan during a 6 @-@ 1 victory , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games were supposed to represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
&quot; that knows , however , the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ains on the first place , which will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will get the first and second place each within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will make the strong Dutch a little longer the way that will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 places during the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work place in London , which we now have . &quot;
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ched the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ r@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball on the left fl@@ ank , then pulled the ball into the middle and smooth@@ ed the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is also , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the Rio de Janeiro events feel constantly and in@@ comprehen@@ sible , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning staff , who is passed by the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to the coffee shop when you talk to your neighbor , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could certainly have been among those known names that would be sent to Prime Time , set up by sponsors and feel @-@ good @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ ender . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic Tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may rule it for a long time .
&quot; but if I would like to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping already has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ ingly perceived over the last 16 years that many people I had asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 an ath@@ lete had made it until the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ ns school as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a world @-@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact , but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ asi@@ um and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines . &quot;
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
&quot; emerging conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need to land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ edge and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are assessed according to the execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; medal hopes have to go forward in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes even to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further increase in television coverage : the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the targeted aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I consider myself a bit tired when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back upwards . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant repe@@ al of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; one of the men on Saturday , also around 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the att@@ endant and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently defeated - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air to rin@@ se , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are sti@@ cking to the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that seventy prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police at shooting changes .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country , and spread out into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was un@@ mer@@ ciful . &quot;
witnesses reported that polic@@ emen shot and killed seventy @-@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism in the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the government oppression - the opposition in the country has been restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options out of protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ j@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after an extensive critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years were more or less forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence and could re@@ arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess on the surface now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media , because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians compl@@ ained that they were so too many protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who came from Ethiopia mainly Christian high @-@ nation@@ als , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ si@@ ghted reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of protests prot@@ ested , who apparently ple@@ dged to ple@@ dge by the government and then stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but evi@@ dently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ art of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , attacked by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests in the US and other Western allies have a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally collap@@ sing in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin breathing walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama has been founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump dism@@ issed the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was absolutely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t would help Mr Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing of it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism comes down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already taken sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s E@@ mails , but he later said &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction occurs . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more estimated sound , as his survey values went further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a big advantage in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump tries to not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s correctness , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back banks , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in the Clinton administration , served as an out@@ sider , allowing IS@@ IS to spread out aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump made his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and prev@@ ailed against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , &quot; twi@@ light &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; They cannot ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ologies than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once about the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a cozy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were pushed away . &quot;
&quot; So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s shop , which was buried in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
native people smoked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , then it is also new creation . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lights from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hing like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural tears .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old clients were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee @-@ sink , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
&quot; he went there before work , and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same . &quot;
&quot; I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap store took the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local safe local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighbouring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entry of the restaurant and the bri@@ m felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a little bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ A last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man was told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cake with olive @-@ pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable blend . &quot;
&quot; as the repor@@ ter questioned Hack@@ ney , this was the couple to discuss the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ uts , liver and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ ries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole have become stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ juven@@ ating food resi@@ dues , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ rated luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar mix@@ tures have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cuisine . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not matched to each other .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country like this . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household @-@ politicians &quot; and to convert p@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man from the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and had a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was really a stranger to reality .
perhaps President Roosev@@ elt could have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate an exam with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the founder of a house@@ keeper had no interest in flavors due to Mrs. Roosev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most dri@@ est . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food to deal with , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law , for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of w@@ asting food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the case of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e came out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ m@@ end@@ es@@ sert , the President Roosev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a usual trick , modest recipes to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped something rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown lim@@ b . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group which , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives on the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the guards , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a mam@@ mot@@ h from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; as a hero , he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I am dying to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from difficulty . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remains of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; the image c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to make terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks mostly come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research ship , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks first get up with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , acceler@@ ates the five meter long animal to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; however , this lifestyle shaped by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this life span , which means ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed for a long time that Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only l@@ acked the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ic@@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers know correspon@@ d@@ ingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks .
&quot; their slow @-@ motion sens@@ ed them , when they equi@@ p six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the prey make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , that tor@@ rent from higher water layers to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 502 cm was measured . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucleus of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as atomic weapons sc@@ atter@@ ing greater amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , in the length of 220 centimet@@ res the len@@ tic@@ ker contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucleus , which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks with the increase obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not acci@@ dental .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ agus flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often especially large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal gets heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse therefore is much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very big animal should invest in a long life rather than in a long life . &quot;
building ground in a double pack
&quot; with themes around building , the municipal council has focused mainly on the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the committee accepted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the plot , parking and clos@@ eness questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications for survey@@ ing could be placed , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) is no longer in the way to interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and the elderly alike .
&quot; as it was said , building wil@@ ly can immediately report in the Town Hall , about the gran@@ ting of the par@@ c@@ els , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also en@@ force inquiries concerning the settlement of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly constructed area of land in sub @-@ sectors only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the commercial area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; as a result , the city on the Main has the best opportunities in competing with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract new jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt is most prof@@ iting from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is sufficient for them to be admitted in the UK . &quot;
that is why big US banks use .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association counts with 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk rate ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg is home to a large f@@ ond@@ ary industry , it is also worse than Dublin &apos;s infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city has an easily available commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Merc@@ er , the city is in place seven , Luxemburg , No. 19 , Dublin , No. 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a finance location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 . &quot;
Gilead gains legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a US counterpart decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. claims the reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs , which you ar@@ isen from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster medications so@@ val@@ di and har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by mer@@ cs , including the Mein@@ l and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the lament on Thursday , US counterpart , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to educ@@ ate Gilead , which is the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck committed each other and claim ownership on laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; the US supported the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j , near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left in the city , a spokes@@ man on Friday said . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they released over 2,000 civil servants , held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared by Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reuters alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its fiscal declaration for 2015 , which revealed an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster Verlag for her book about her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton released his tax declarations for the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective accoun@@ tant of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards for financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and returns with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; jump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his refusal a tax audit by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidates of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions were not completed . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among other things the republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already stated that his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business plans and various other links , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks to publish his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke to the subject even during a speech to the Michigan economy . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO announced that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and a New York Times business journalist paid a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this might still be the case . &quot;
the federal government has become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure that individuals pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in Om@@ aha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its seat , Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to an IR@@ S tax audit as well , and Tr@@ ump has &quot; fear &quot; in front of the voters and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the government &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and yields from USD 10@@ 9,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with Chi@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the honey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea for years ago , intensi@@ fied its funding by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
many for@@ war@@ ders have previously used to defend themselves .
&quot; Friday is the Day of the World , dedicated to animal protection . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , with much more confidence that they can prevent the eleph@@ ants from their fields without harm the elephant , &quot; said the Managing Director of Honey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps cover the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ fle@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; the mixed with earth is packed into a con@@ dom together with a fire@@ work body , whose end is turned towards the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already out to hunt the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er who sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ works in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pre@@ fix , as Arab guests had requested &quot; &quot; according to a staff &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann had tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels in the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own call centre . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he got there , &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel staff stated that the measure was an &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , in the director , even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; was quoted the employee of Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has been added to this hotel chain in Germany is even more dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet where people called for a sc@@ andal .
some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests .
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; she said in another post , in which it was pointed out , that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of itself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; not to include Israel in the election list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
added that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ y tear gas &amp; rubber missi@@ les against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students gathered in the Brazilian city Sao Paulo with the police when they assembled to protest against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police set tear gas and rubber missi@@ les against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to deal with the students , which led the police to take rubber missi@@ les and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their dism@@ ay on the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , something less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants were seen to spray Gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er at walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators in the masses went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ issed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , the interest in the parties of Russian companies in the country grew sharp@@ ly , shared the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian enterprises set up existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the down@@ turn was achieved through deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian delegation represented around 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily to travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran hit the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hoping it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the socio @-@ educational daily group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection association Nag@@ old with their super@@ vis@@ ors at their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet of the Freizei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
for one thing we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the string z@@ oos .
&quot; on the other hand , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep Lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the culinary delights of children and super@@ vis@@ ors with their own cour@@ ty@@ ards , such as the Sau@@ ras Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch in St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were ma@@ stered . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ ance pilgrimage of all mini@@ stries in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ te round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were tested and they decided finally for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where in this year , during the Holy Year of Merc@@ y , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Merc@@ y with the opened doors of mercy on the Freiburg cathedral . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern were on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and divided the pilgrims . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Mu@@ enster Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster was started . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made ra@@ ast to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgri@@ m song book . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;

we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; the day after St. Peter &apos;s leg , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , had to be lowered at first about 500 metres in altitude and then climbed again . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her . &quot;
&quot; after the morning pulse , on the fourth pilgrimage day in the impressive convent church of St. Peter , we went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;

with a little impulse God was given thanks .
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is was greeted by the destination of Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite has won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the male team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his way to E@@ igen . the hun@@ ts@@ man made the legend proudly when he came home to win a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago England claimed a shock@@ ing victory , while Ho@@ y received the fifth of six Olympics medals . &quot;
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in March despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as hin@@ der .
&quot; Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close . &quot;
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who were victorious four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner won an olymp@@ ic ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ings the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he left behind , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down , and to enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name .
we set up an olymp@@ ic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der reported that after a weak start he was deliberately falling off the track . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
for such a great victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags on the stands like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which have won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23rd March ( a apparently sacred date for British sports ; on that day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next to the Sprint that will start today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should become a k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the World Record , who won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; he had fought yesterday with commission@@ ers before the qualification , when they called him officials to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team relies on his strong train steering team to dominate the medium @-@ sized period of the Olympic Games and to take a row of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; dr@@ amas in the background played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ b@@ ings , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like the legendary reputation GB@@ s , who reached its climax at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to lifting the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium sh@@ mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - stand in the game , as the plant operator canc@@ els the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 work@@ places in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs - direct , indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed at a closure . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa within Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the sm@@ el@@ ting process , &quot; &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts should be so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force in November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the Tre@@ aties in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting process or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have come into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume some 600 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity a year and spend some 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity a year . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as an electricity producer , this would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , kri@@ p@@ t@@ opped reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as the presence of all the most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é episode of nearly every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ nant brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a broadcast square at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this public@@ ity somehow . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
&quot; the revelation of his cover stars is expected to be so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited , that in the last two years , images of the magazine are still le@@ aking out before the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the model@@ n &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ Prize Win@@ ner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence in 2013 was on the cover a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner , described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today , who know how to make a good snap@@ shot video ( even if everything is true on denom@@ in@@ ators ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her and called her &quot; the Mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot; &quot;
these feelings again cooked up when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to go around on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
&quot; and in her free time , she is to be seen in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot;
&quot; community centres have 16@@ 0,000 people annually . &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief agencies are aver@@ ted annually by the municipalities , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ usion and similar - have been rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the church , which are already out@@ law@@ ed , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l , the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Centers yiel@@ ded that thousands of people have already been dism@@ issed each year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without a suspension of the decision of the federal government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s congreg@@ ational centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need will be dism@@ issed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and crus@@ hing debts , families who have been dism@@ issed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the aid they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the federal government will shor@@ ten the funding by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of vulnerable people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the general public prosec@@ utor and federal jus@@ tices and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these aver@@ ages , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government completed its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees with@@ drew weapons
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action , having been informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February had directed a fire@@ arm to an employee , while in February they were on the road in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini used to have been waiting for months that the matter would be settled internally before realizing that &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the de@@ duction and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after having compl@@ ained about the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini stated that at least four other people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to damage damage , &quot; Bord@@ ini added . &quot;
&quot; the charge comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dissolved a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms and weapons friends - should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton were elected and appoint judges . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not cont@@ end with violence .
Bishop &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and of Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ acher Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; phone calls at his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not respon@@ sive . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the Federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties stand out . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys from the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD top@@ pled from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market . &quot;
&quot; today , the success@@ ors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot;
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not well in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , that would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came just 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for that standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible using HTML browsers , though tor@@ mented slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was rather proud of the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was € 3@@ 92 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today the market domin@@ ates vendors who came much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; sold about 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple are alone 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry was created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple boss Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al proc@@ ession started , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ a now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
&quot; on average , each German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to make the smartphone even better , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , creating 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ inate ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ yers were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming but He@@ ath@@ row answers any asked question .
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single infrastructure projects . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games from 2012 were a big success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ er &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that make money with online advertising , according to one of the software producers try to b@@ ypass advertisement blocking , a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog@@ post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ publish advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop site would change the enco@@ ding with regard to his advertisements , in order to make it more difficult to identify which part of the page advertising is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in and @-@ forth struggle between the time @-@ seeing open source community and the envel@@ oping has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embar@@ ked on the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display lock@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks makes . &quot;
&quot; the company has opted for ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Chrom@@ ebooks &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenue , so that Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be &quot; &quot; advertisers &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their commerci@@ als . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adding new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a spokes@@ person on Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focus on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman in susp@@ ects suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed on a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed herself in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was transferred by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she still died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said that this and every witness of the incident promp@@ ted to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having passed a man and killed a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the police officer , who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; totally unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its tag@@ ging of the sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
&quot; the model produced a history of Venus , which resembles evolution , which had previously been suspected of planetary research . &quot;
&quot; although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billion years . &quot;
their oceans were ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research L@@ etters .
Patrick Roy back as coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy went back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations from the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a very low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively @-@ President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and certainty , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination with decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick told me this decision today , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee @-@ workers take up talks again , set out strikes &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles for the remun@@ eration for North @-@ sea workers are suspended , while all dispute parties have to sit at the table for a new round of discussion , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the Wood @-@ field service provider Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally operated on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the withdrawal process of the present strike , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
we will keep a few full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year in order to restart the problems .
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has cut the install@@ ments to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the required room to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re@@ union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; due to lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation which was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson , met workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

Ke@@ pler ass@@ esses the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ house of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest Mission with the Ke@@ pler Space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden .
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates , as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods with planetary emergence are standing . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which emerged around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ational rates , these rip@@ ening stars face large amounts of star@@ vation . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star @-@ stain -- like sun@@ spots -- .
&quot; the latest collection of rot@@ ational rates points out , that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars revol@@ ving slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ run of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot ahead of us what we like to learn more about how , when and why star slow down their rot@@ ational rates and to speak their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues report in detail about their latest analysis of the ple@@ ad@@ ings of the ple@@ ad@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball Star
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days of Base zu Base .
&quot; after his emotional re@@ mitt@@ ance announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will take the tri@@ cot of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees a last time on August 12 against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to join , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game Parti@@ cip@@ ant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been reported to him $ 27 million . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ tion on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the Hall of Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , due to the involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , he was locked for 211 games by the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect , for years having received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida . &quot;
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days were not silent .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legend in their last games get once again the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; estimated Y@@ ank@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to Cameron Di@@ az and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the fans at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught up : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio may not start . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing attacks have become known as Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese Flo@@ at Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le ch@@ ase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was already proven last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ ating agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the talks about 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) applied for the opening of the B @-@ rehear@@ sal and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court in CAS and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases is responsible . &quot;
&quot; in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova went through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; This is an unbelievable shock , &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; declared the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , the prohibited substance is to act for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ Probe should have already been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ lete doesn &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both of them deny the intake , however , they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is a further serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Association had not allowed the entire Russian team to start the startup , except for systematic do@@ ings , even the runners in Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier verses in China had also taken care of fierce disputes between the athletes . &quot;
so the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I will pass over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun stood at the centre of an examination with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested at the Chinese champ@@ ionships in 2014 on the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din stimul@@ ant , but only had to sit a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
&quot; Daten@@ kl@@ au : &quot; &quot; per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ackers &quot; &quot; their ran@@ som &quot;
programmer of black@@ mail malware is currently specifically targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 per cent of the companies were already the target of a Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 per cent of the victims will@@ ingly paid the solution required by the perpetr@@ ators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ mail ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most malware programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place quickly in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as by archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ases the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are interested in sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production still stands . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a Ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt business activity , in a case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany several hospitals had already been victims of attacks , their patients could be threatened by the loss of patient acts . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure use the pay@@ load areas and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims per chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if individuals are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must bar@@ gain and pay five @-@ digit tot@@ als to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers become more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the so @-@ called malware @-@ Kits were created by the malware themselves , advice and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the delivery includes a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for more h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commis@@ sions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per f@@ enced calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals charge sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known by many companies who want to secure their data better .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful testing , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing strategies , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the potential for damage is much higher depending on the type of data . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the offen@@ ders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty crowded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the interior design materials are well processed and comfortable , only the cock@@ pit top@@ side falls down . &quot;
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage space .
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l for high @-@ resolution and 10@@ 26 l with back@@ rests , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded like kin@@ os@@ ols and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than for the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V due to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; his work , however , seems to be somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the top version &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; the equipment does not leave any wishes un@@ fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; the security systems belong to the City emergency braking assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane assistance assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates , because during manoeu@@ v@@ ring many obstacles are rated as &quot; &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent tem@@ per respon@@ ds to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tle when required the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity exists only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ dies@@ els are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on passenger jet@@ bridges .
&quot; the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht ( Ober@@ landes@@ gericht ) , Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) , is conceivable only for dangers , which are typical of air traffic . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a knee injury in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general life risk , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
disease Case : when pays the Organ@@ izer
&quot; after their journey , holiday@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found in the hotel without doubt . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten per cent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negotiated case , a family was severely affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective sewage treatment , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
&quot; the family felt that the trip had been poor , and was compl@@ aining about the organis@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only knew about the plain@@ ti@@ ff before leaving the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so the judgment . &quot;
no im@@ pur@@ ities were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - belongs to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , in July many people had concerns about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be owned and determined at the same time to respond to terrorist attacks .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if perpetr@@ ators had to leave the country faster , it increased safety and also the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of proposals by 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of the security forces , &quot; in a medium @-@ four size order over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be under punishment . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance is said to be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is difficult . &quot;
the last much discussed tail light for physicians should stay protected according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères terms .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to seek solutions how the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at psych@@ ical ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister maintains a better social support . &quot;
teachers must be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly expressed himself against shareholders .
&quot; this was an ear@@ ring for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had dism@@ issed calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .
&quot; in the case of a general ban on full @-@ wear , it is un@@ constitutional . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t do everything you refuse , and I lean back wearing the bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; one could talk about rules about road traffic , or for witnesses to court . &quot;
&quot; green boss Simone Peter threw the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate the vig@@ il@@ ance and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorism charges . &quot;
&quot; left party Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verbs and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway zu@@ br@@ inger
it st@@ owed regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture from November .
but this is to change : the right of law should be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers who are at the traffic road every night in traffic jam , when they drive over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße , the right @-@ hand bend lane by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then cycle directly from the Hammer street to the right .
&quot; the major advantage : the traffic is spl@@ itted in the early stages , thereby improving the overall running process on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder pus@@ hes the motor@@ ists especially between 17 and 7 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back @-@ up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h way and sometimes also goes beyond . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the needle &apos;s eye is on B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic is defl@@ ected only one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built in front of a well @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load force , in order to record the heavy load traffic two @-@ track . &quot;
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated value of traffic will last , cannot be said of the competent country . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official residual use period of up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays , because with disabilities to reck@@ on . &quot;
the traffic will be trac@@ ed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : culture Offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association enables young people with migrant and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus &quot; &quot; has a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the N@@ ima Association , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the staging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ ima Association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December you@@ ths with and without escape and migration background will be able to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;

rain instead of star@@ ry dolls : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the star gra@@ ving Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the Sou@@ thwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad due to clouds and rain for watching the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is to be good , then we will see a lot of sky@@ lights in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the stars are Per@@ sei@@ den , which with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they seem to come out of the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night it is long awake , in the morning , far from the wake @-@ up , it is no longer necessary to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many underlying causes for them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eder , member of the board member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schla@@ ff@@ ord and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in- and diar@@ rho@@ ea . &quot;
&quot; it is just the falling asleep that many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early awakening is common especially during a depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eder . &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition one another .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ nia , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to p@@ onder@@ s about everyday problems and worries , there is one example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one become a doctor with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , said We@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; impair@@ ment may look quite different : it is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any sleep medical in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , when sleeping difficulties , one should first turn to the family doctor , said We@@ ert . &quot;
this can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , for examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise , for example , snor@@ ing with respiratory problems , in case of illness , in case of illness , in case of in@@ som@@ nia or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the sale , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one is wearing a nas@@ al rim , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws for better sleep .
&quot; it counts on : regular sleep and rising times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , stop drinking alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the Jung@@ le camp has to have with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time and presented his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler has placed their protection against his ex @-@ team colleagues standing in the criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a j@@ unk of € 150,000 no one should wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly the way you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; &quot; asks the election of Hamburg , who meanwhile runs an ice cream shop . &quot;
airport : ban@@ de checked by luggage
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport Düsseldorf
&quot; on Thursday , the police officers of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and luggage theft as a ban@@ de .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang that was known to the police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ici@@ des since the middle of July , and were involved in a community @-@ based and especially professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the &quot; &quot; Krimin@@ al@@ kom@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 &quot; &quot; can demonstrate the th@@ iev@@ es that have entered Germany specifically for the off@@ ence of crimes committed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they had captured more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few tree @-@ trees , still another rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem like that , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a refres@@ hed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be built . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , however , in recent weeks , article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , is preferred with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the occup@@ ants have rent contracts , on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior coordinator H@@ enkel recorded several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ ched official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three cl@@ ub@@ team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers pulled off under the che@@ ating of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain front Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main source of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs three children here , are primarily anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of increasing r@@ ents and centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who is interested in police protection from v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior coordinator and the police force between home owners and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and were still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the bor@@ ough has become increasingly mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world in recent years : with them residents of GDR times and former home owners share their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on designed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were disc@@ ar@@ ded with color bags .
no other road was mentioned this year as often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours can see this as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : according to criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury , statistics are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes make property damages , which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant house next to the disp@@ uted 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been destined . &quot;
&quot; even the famous burning cars , there are no longer there in Riga . &quot;
&quot; for the architect , the street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and stayed .
&quot; that is why it was so important that the residents got their streets : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by jo@@ in@@ ting new buildings in former buildings that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well infected here , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction cannot be seen absolutely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you want to do if someone is never listening ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for breeding enthusiasts who are anno@@ yed about color bombs : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can badly complain about noise there . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Council for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , Arbeits@@ kreis Refu@@ ge , Administration , Auth@@ orities and who else is still involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the cutting @-@ edge wo@@ ollen jacket , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less spot@@ less than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant pur@@ pos@@ efully - meant as the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative expert with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a cutting @-@ edge wo@@ ollen cloth . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with local people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there will be new containers in the W@@ as@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the follow @-@ up refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the inter@@ connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility is changed from the Land Registry to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search is very difficult for some time .
&quot; in fact , the administration does not find any private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work so far , whether you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , communal dwell@@ ings must be er@@ ased as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers are set up in the W@@ as@@ strasse . &quot;
&quot; but only with apartments , it is not done . &quot;
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be conceived or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as reported by Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activity means not only work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say deu@@ scher and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so here are administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedures is a problem .
&quot; they have to explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever develops the feeling , he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problem cases also , says customer honest , &quot; people , where nothing works . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a risk could and may not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensi@@ ti@@ zed already .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins killed them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them on site . &quot;
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bach are already busy , to integrate the previous people wis@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , one must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : recru@@ it searched by helicopter
the police helicopter flew over several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were for@@ ci@@ bly forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ lows into the flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1.70 meters tall , probably mas@@ k@@ ered , both wore Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ses . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; at the same time , the police put a number of strip occup@@ ations as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag ran without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , in fact , fell near the apartment or in their flight . &quot;
Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg : police det@@ ects after ro@@ cker attack on I@@ mb@@ iss
