<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of change at the beach with some colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted in the fast gallop back home to the feed troughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," "says Langer."</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let himself lead his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not fall for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for a long time, the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports helmet handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">Awards do not lack the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, Champions Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting offspring for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 further outstanding sportsmen, the double US mast winner was recorded on Saturday in the" Hall of Fame of German Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giengen, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreements - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are, however, in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The idea of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the case of doubt, Trump aims to keep small and cautious about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to taxish the economy to death and to regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively return regulars, and he is strongly committed to far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, states: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes would increase for the rich, she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton are saying almost the same."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could be further internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in protected areas in so far, to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton on the other hand wants to extend and claim the renewable energies with its investment programme:" "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only with the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazial trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, the US does not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid for better, calls for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage needs rink, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics face him, so the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, at least demanding from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of women, who are fleeing alone, almost to everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby that is at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is an area manager of Condrobs, a supporter of social relief services in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs opened up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it has been officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a bearer of hope."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the flight:" "many steal secretly from it because they do not see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, murder victims, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs call for a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north, traumatized, she appreciates."</seg>
<seg id="33">Some of the children were certainly not voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">Or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big.</seg>
<seg id="36">"because they often don't know to help, there are more accommodations just for them, demands bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction, some answers with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone women alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Unter- und Mittelfranken there are in some common underground floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are home separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or will men and women stay together, it can - perpetual - violence against women come."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection, can be read at the urge to go to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around, we have a long queue," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistants have called on their union to approve new labour struggles in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for its entire Council to approve more labour struggles from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC testified that the ministers had failed to respond to the worrying about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistently quiet "to problems, which led to the conclusion that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In consideration of this, the JDC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official new negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as a response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal motion to a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour struggles which begins at the beginning of September."</seg>

<seg id="11">"the head of BMA assistants Dr. Johann Malawana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions, which were advised by the BMA."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes receipt of his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the strike, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin smiled smiles, and he hardly radiated warmth, even for its restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan had behaved so badly as if anything bad happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the downfall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Heroes of Pleven Commemorated in Moscow Wreathes from the Russian Ministry of Defense and Bulgarian Embassy were laid at the pediment of the memorial church.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the offence was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the etracker again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media conducted a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the serious accusations of leading officials were that Erdogan's own family had profited from illegal oil trade in Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apology that he wanted to hear from the President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been enthralled at a failed coup d'état of almost his ministry last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisle attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television projected cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious to the West, since its reaction to the attempted takeover of power is regarded as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued grudge of the snail-empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, Russian head of state won a bonus for the fact that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d'état."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is surely a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent, as an analyst once described to me," Alliance of outsiders ": two countries that violate the West and treated badly and now allied themselves."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents had said that they would not even have grasped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately denied it to answer a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shouted the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="16">"I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.</seg>

<seg id="5">"in a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has ordered Ivanov's discharge from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been a proxy since 2012, became his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it means (in Russian) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Head of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think it's the government's most important task to support your work as head of state, regarding bills of laws and controls to implement your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov has been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time, and works like he for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff was back at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, at once wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say to me - complaining about complaints for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin reached power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov's second term president could be President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office would violate the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry cross-dressings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blower" "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"business minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today, and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry cross-dressings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total deck-deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of trendsetting high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after installing the last section of the road and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the gap between the north or the north."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern jetty bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>

<seg id="10">"the big issue in the town hall is, however, so Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time watching TV screens, has been sued by many over the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs emerged from it)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones outside and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they were found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the cell phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the track and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the USA, the game has led to a considerable rise in steps which the" average "person withdraws every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of sequentious people, which train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data on performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take" "30 minutes of time", "" "coming from the sofa" "and" "being active every day" "on deaf ears, because many public messages for health are boring and come from people who look elusive."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sport, reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonder at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as usual, there are also mürerous game-spoils that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has happened a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be followed by time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, more active and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present at the gymnasium in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish is and Madison Kocian, the Cathokin, round off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected unexpected but masterful gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual campaign for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see some sports classes in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie launched all the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "last five", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics is a more expensive sport and gymnasts come primarily in private gyms that are maintained by parents who pay for training, setup, travel, clothing, competition, and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these associations, the Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes, since they started their gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the congregations in innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easier access training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">"during my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of" Girl Power "by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thank you, you get so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">The culture of the political Correctness is blossoming in Muslim areas.</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfor Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">"a culture of political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored, like a devastating government report today."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, picks up the police, polls and town halls to ignore the evidence of electoral misuse due to" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of Integration and Communal Government, which is now an antagonist, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives is so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should lead an identification with themselves, in order to prove their identity at elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must merely call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable inks to the finger of a person, when they give off their vote to prevent someone elects twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against suffrage, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by the Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lutfor Rahman had to be enthralled after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" in a cynical way, "and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which a person elects someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed himself alarming to the fraudulent letter-election, when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guidance of evidence to prove identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it is said:" "as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladesh backgrounds."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have unknowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity in regard to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists process stamp documents to stop" reaping. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters to vote for your ID card.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable inks on the finger of a person, as soon as they have left their voice to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>

<seg id="33">Intensifying the training to ensure that the staff rule out that voters go alone in the voting booth.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric runs through the Metropolitan Police and finds it" astounding, "that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no criminal complaint."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unfit," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, he was found guilty of due to the high requirements in criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he also criticises the non-effective" "check-ups" "of the constituencies of the town hall."</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the buyers did not know where to look, when a woman went out of her clothes in the midst of a landmark to try underpants."</seg>
<seg id="3">"to worsen the situation, she looked at how she looked at it, pulled her off and put her back to the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">You continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the landmark business in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put her back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the same time in business, said that after the mysterious woman tried to underwear the underwear, she got rid of her and left her business without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: "people could not believe what they saw.</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the outlay, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when she pulled out the underpants, which you obviously didn't like, as she once again placed them on the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">"she repeated the same with three further underpants, before she finally decided that she did not fall back and went out."</seg>

<seg id="15">"Ms. Davidson added:" "as I received, the employees tried to draw the pieces of clothing from the sale after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and figuring out that another woman had her and pulled out and washed her again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabt his tongue for a travel guide his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and sausage in a serious trial - by hiding some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk put his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before checking each object, he used a luminometer to show up and to show us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of detecting the rinsing button of a traction toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to physicians and medical experts on the promotion of gut bacteria as well as their own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left behind what he tasted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright became known to test the resistance of his bowels by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railways to stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task presented its immune system definitely below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was in any case justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test line showed a luminometric count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison to this, the luminous number of hands of fresh washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after their Luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio have produced the" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "This comes close to the worst thing I have put in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I'm not going to check here, because it is disgusting inside."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of Milk Products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valio Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted mad Brainstorming who ended up saying that we said "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how they are associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who was directing the film, added:" let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to blame them and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am happy that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.</seg>

<seg id="1">"asocial family destroys prior to delogging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall"</seg>
<seg id="2">"an asocial family left her social apartment after a delusion with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocking employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls dismissed holes, wooden boards were roughened, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that terror, which had inflicted the family, consisted of street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive cries, strikes and flights."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished under certain circumstances, old garbage was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn apart."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly invoked the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner by force this week by giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the delogation were cheered by lightened neighbors, saying that their lives were made to hell."</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They were not ashamed of anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived for 20 years along with them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today, tomorrow we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a disgrace that the tenant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as delogation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously committed to us and have provided us with the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will provide consolation to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress residing in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to widen garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police introduced a raid in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales, parapheritalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine-penalty after having found guilty of a drug of class B in trade foresight.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after having been without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the rooms of the house were covered with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">"the police say they will deltogze tenants, which do not stick to the house rules"</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow was informed by the police of Devon and Cornwall, that delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not cling to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without reproach, as well as those who have been damaged by such a conduct," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="7">"because the government had already passed Kurdish strongholds with penalties in the course of months, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the frosted putsch, even secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get out of the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"sorry, this entry is only available in Deutsch."</seg>
<seg id="5">"because more stupid than so far, it's not possible: summer holidays, heat and land elections - this bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the polls, are on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the most vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not natives, so you can't choose the land day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: in the holidays there are helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count on the end of voices, only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again to pass an election campaign to the people over them."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say this at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">"exciting is how strong Neuling AfD cuts off, and what remains at the end of the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and Prime Minister since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one can see from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, spread roses and chats a little with the people, just as it was his legendary word-carer, Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Merkel the blame on the flowering of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We are creating this, "hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which now probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its leading candidate, the Minister of Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major shows; Merkel Bundestaglusconi is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the audience didn't agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other German states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"but it too bad, nobody from other corners of Germany, even to listen to Angela Merkel."</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Northeast-CDU largely waives the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, so says Kokert, only plays a" subordinate role. ""</seg>

<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing:" "they have to go where it hurts, namely, where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party needs to be used."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and finish only against 8 o'clock, there are always praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything rather zacky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the reciprocity of the responsible persons responsible for the construction work will also be vowed, for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation entrances."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site on Monday is immigrated to the south and also the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been cancelled, and thus the connection to Rottenburg has resumed, the traffic situation within the town has eased."</seg>

<seg id="15">"as the speed limits have not been met, the municipality also demanded an increase in the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant overrides," "says King, who himself made himself aware of the situation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been dazzled.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest race was at 77 Hours in the pace-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for the business people at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, that the B 27-refurbishment has led to revenue bursts, everyone can look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"who has less to do with the" end customer, "i.e. for other companies, has hardly any consequences for the refurbishment."</seg>

<seg id="36">"instead, government President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the hostess would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it also has to bear the disadvantages that arise through the rehabilitation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÖHNER knows from other counties, where something more generous is handled."</seg>

<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history."</seg>

<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high refugee figures."</seg>

<seg id="9">"in Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who wants to buy vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle-age love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you come to the comment part, to sow it under the pseudonym of non-avenue men's middle aged with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multifaceted resurrection of records is not on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the newness of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely number of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly congratulate before I stop, hold my hands and say something like 'so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to evaluate their age and mind through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Glasgow, 55, by Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford, when she appeared and re-selling items he sold when he was young and plagued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke, and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, which he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also notices a new wave of people affected by the media pump, people who have heard about the comeback and get to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have conducted, people usually have gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers assumed impetus to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound plate envelopes, from objects that call up happy jugenders."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee is buttoning from a record pile."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, have not yet listened."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I fell through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle aged men), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here just recently and said," "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so that I can put them on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-like, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly enter."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the record to almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I enter."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's newest synthesizer- and sexbepacked pop instead of experimental jazz drumps from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks odd, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to realize when you stand next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window shopping as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a dearest sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I seem to show the jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group themselves for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a cross ley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some are so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most for luxury items like records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in record shops in Soho, have not taken into account the large number of female collector's in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they do not spend their thursday tomorrow with the strolling through panels of the Berwick Street and the sheets by plates, while they avoid the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, that sticks over the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should settle 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and that would take a fire and sanitation risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely transparent."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it stated that the closure" for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two auxiliary organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants underestimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcomers throughout the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance during the 7-year rugby came to a abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro stage."</seg>

<seg id="12">Fiji began to marry and let the attacks of GBs have fun.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more remote gold than those playing and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard salts that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when she rowed to the second Olympiagold in the second without a tax-woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.- unshattered commitment, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not reflected in the way of triumph."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of wild helpers who make up the difference, and no one was able to make any difference to the trainer, who didn't know if he was diagnosed with cancer before 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, it spread everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>

<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-spreading morning a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who as Captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment was in use in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer of the world."</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began closing, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">"financial burdens, which threatened the industry from green electricity production, are from the table."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the release of the Renewable Energy Transformation in the existing systems for the so-called self-production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) said the" Westdeutscher Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the last two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission initially had planned to ask the steel producers, the gases coming from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption, to ask for the checkout."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with the Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, all an EEG levelling unit is 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also these will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo is largely attributed to the previous control."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign" "steel is future" "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others need to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the reform of the emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are weighed down," explained IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation was further worsening when the world's largest producer of China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers launch Chinese steel corporations pricing dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation was somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have accumulated."</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear is how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have been more stagnant again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude closing statements of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced less than six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, such as steel trading on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the quantity produced now went back to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has risen by two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good in her health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors like from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"because in doing so, senior citizens exercise deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who demands his lungs regularly is not as fast as the puste in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"for elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people awakens a lot of memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people lose themselves to long-lying events with dementia."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just elderly people who live alone, practice not only focusing on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I have a long time for something, I will be better and watch over me - this experience reinforces."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there's enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, he advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"one does not sing alone - for 50 singing people, who hears there when a sound goes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the suitable offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior's choir, you can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also provide overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="17">We assume that this is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but it is likely to be the acts of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, explained that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"instead, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were put."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in the past few days, the authorities have received secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and the places."</seg>
<seg id="24">Still be unclear what group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) paid for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a big influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country progressed towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, keeps himself too good to have led the kingdom to stability and order."</seg>

<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympian or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia were so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte became the viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended his course with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather its not exactly sporting figure which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming pool.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in sub-presented countries well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as most sportsmen run in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">"some media called him" "Robel der Wal." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" prosperity bump, "the English tabloid" The Sun "made it funny with" Dad Bod. ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only hit the 100 m Freestyle with a minute and almost five seconds, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a suburb of more than 100 m Freestyle alone."</seg>
<seg id="21">"at that time, Moussambani was fired at that time."</seg>

<seg id="5">"due to legal grounds, the Kazendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from puppets, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to reach deeper in the purse."</seg>

<seg id="2">"snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are blunt, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies each day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All misprints arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week several users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth, and evaporated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" Yellow-face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repeated controversy surfaced a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and the indignation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who experienced racism, the filter reminded of vulnerable clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"grace Sparapani wrote in an e-mail, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, that the filter was" hurtful and said. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contrasting Asian caricature and filtering effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not safe, but that the yellow face was pulled into the downward extrem."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolperkite.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are more diversed in the breed than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchat's filters created a picture that is offensive for a user," "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case," "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racist controversies reflect lack of diversity in the inclusion practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the most part white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely ignored Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, it refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a personnel manager who concentrated on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts."</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership distorts ISIS secrecy information, establishes Committee of Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed post-intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual conditions were allowed on site, reported a committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Army Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Armed Forces Committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command Intelligence's analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, shortly cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information that typically had been sent out by high-level Centcom commanders regularly reported a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism, as the actual conditions on site were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what has happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there are no direct evidence suggesting that government tips given under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, statements and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than it was the facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom applicant publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it is so clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's tips changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations in the CentCom are being carried out by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news service committee on Thursday published their own findings which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively restricted trial for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "announced the Supreme Demokrat in the Committee of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Ship," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "damaging the morale among analysts and" gave excessively little space for differing opinions. ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats did not give any evidence of intervention of the White House at CentCom Analyst in regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspectors, which were received after complaints from CentCom Analyst."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave in a statement that the Department of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the general inspections are still under way."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that has meanwhile been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"but the accusations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the Secret Information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes between more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts a little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to indicate that there were no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group against the refineries dictated by the Islamic State, as these temporary refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three gates over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games were supposed to represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"that knows, however, the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britains on the first place, which will remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will get the first and second place each within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will make the strong Dutch a little longer the way that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed on the last of 12 places during the last London Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"we did not have the work place in London, which we now have."</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely snatched the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torrgen in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball on the left flank, then pulled the ball into the middle and smoothed the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is also, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the Rio de Janeiro events feel constantly and incomprehensible, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, who is passed by the wristband to the swimmer to the gymnast for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to the coffee shop when you talk to your neighbor, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's swarm with dimples, could certainly have been among those known names that would be sent to Prime Time, set up by sponsors and feel-good-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even fender."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may rule it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I would like to make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping already has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparingly perceived over the last 16 years that many people I had asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 an athlete had made it until the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school as the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a world-bound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact, but also the Grazie of gymnasium and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines."</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging conquerors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need to land a number of falling movements (turning, hedge and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic program, they are assessed according to the execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medal hopes have to go forward in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes even to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further increase in television coverage: the world or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I consider myself a bit tired when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prallt off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back upwards."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant repeal of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; one of the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the attendant and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently defeated - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his air to rinse, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long a ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are sticking to the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that seventy protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at shooting changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months protests against the government shook the country, and spread out into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was unmerciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that policemen shot and killed seventy-armed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism in the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the government oppression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and have no other options out of protest, it breaks out," "said Sejm Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after an extensive criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years were more or less forced to exploit the turbulence and could rearm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness on the surface now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media, because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians complained that they were so too many protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who came from Ethiopia mainly Christian high-nationals, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under one umbrella," "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unsighted reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of protests protested, who apparently pledged to pledge by the government and then stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misart of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharian city, attacked by Tigray, and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests in the US and other Western allies have a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally collapsing in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin breathing walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has been founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by saying that his repeatedly repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump dismissed the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said, he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was absolutely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt would help Mr Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing of it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism comes down to Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already taken sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's Emails, but he later said" "Of course, I said the sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" "clarify" "depending on how the reaction occurs." "said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert, who observes the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more estimated sound, as his survey values went further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a lead with a big advantage in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump tries to not apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent intercessors, had great difficulty defending the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's correctness, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it back banks, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in the Clinton administration, served as an outsider, allowing ISIS to spread out aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump made his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and prevailed against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the" poor, "twilight" television experts trying to understand him and said, "They cannot!." "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked about Mr. Trumps apologies than just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="8">"a revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing staff of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working in 2001 at Verb and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a client offered to provide money for a new branch, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>

<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old clients were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly."</seg>

<seg id="34">"nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese."</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no grudge about the fact that the soap store took the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>

<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a little bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COA last book" "Chop Suey" "dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman was told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest co-operation," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, schnörkellosem snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cake with olive-pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable blend."</seg>
<seg id="12">"as the reporter questioned Hackney, this was the couple to discuss the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanuts, liver and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense issue," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was as tense: mysterious foods such as bread and casserole have become staple foods, the casserole as a" wonderful way of rejuvenating food residues, "said Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serrated luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar mixtures have been tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not matched to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the farm recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, budgetary economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country like this."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" household-politicians "and to convert pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship, this shark was allowed to return to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks first get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, accelerates the five meter long animal to satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this lifestyle shaped by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," "commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means vertebrates a world record."</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolutionary biologist assumed for a long time that Greenland's sharks become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the icsea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow-motion sensed them, when they equip six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the prey make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers, that torrent from higher water layers to the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland-sharks, which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 cm was measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as atomic weapons scattering greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other hand, in the length of 220 centimetres the lenticker contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, which arises from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"indeed, the carbon-14 clock showed a 493 centimetre long Greenland-shark an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland's sharks with the increase obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, whose bacon on the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often especially large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal gets heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse therefore is much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very big animal should invest in a long life rather than in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raste last night in the male team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his way to Eigen. the huntsman made the legend proudly when he came home to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy received the fifth of six Olympics medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in March despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Hoys retired a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - who were victorious four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner won an olympic ord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he left behind, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down, and to enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell to Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys side, Hinder reported that after a weak start he was deliberately falling off the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">For such a great victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said:" "it feels like London with all the UK flags on the stands like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which have won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape of Kenny, it is possible that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23rd March (a apparently sacred date for British sports; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next to the Sprint that will start today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should become a knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the World Record, who won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought yesterday with commissioners before the qualification, when they called him officials to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team relies on his strong train steering team to dominate the medium-sized period of the Olympic Games and to take a row of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"dramas in the background played in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April, in the midst of sexism and mobbings, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like the legendary reputation GBs, who reached its climax at the perfect moment."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to lifting the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium shmelts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - stand in the game, as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">"not less than 2000 jobs - direct, indirect - could be jeopardised at a closure."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects since the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa within Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelting process," "shared the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts should be so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have come into force in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," "said the electricity supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it had already written the value of the Treaties in the amount of $187 million in" "anticipation of a cancellation." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the Treaties, the" ability of Alcoas... to operate the smelting process or to ensure the power supply to the smelting "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have come into force from November this year, even if it is still an explanation of why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">"due to the poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume some 600 megawatts of electricity a year and spend some 900 megawatts of electricity a year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as an electricity producer, this would not be good," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="8">"Kendalls's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="14">Oscar-Prize Winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence in 2013 was on the cover a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner, described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the former category, it is in good company."</seg>

<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners don't like success everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called her" the Mistress of the moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings again cooked up when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not well in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes, that would suffice today for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>

<seg id="10">"for a few euros fans can buy the equipment on the internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we are already 10,000 new apprenticeships, creating 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport."</seg>

<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blaminate ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-flyers were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming but Heathrow answers any asked question.</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for single infrastructure projects."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented catwalks of the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games from 2012 were a big success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blogpost in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re-publish advertising on the social network."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop site would change the encoding with regard to his advertisements, in order to make it more difficult to identify which part of the page advertising is advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blogpost, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" this kind of hin and-forth struggle between the time-seeing open source community and the enveloping has been underway since the invention of display blockers, "and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicators for the industry have become.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe, some 200 million people use display lockers worldwide; almost four times as much as 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising 84 percent of the advertising revenue Facebooks makes."</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed on a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman placed herself in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was transferred by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on site.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said that this and every witness of the incident prompted to report."</seg>

<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway, it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its tagging of the sun almost two months," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model produced a history of Venus, which resembles evolution, which had previously been suspected of planetary research."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotational rates, these ripening stars face large amounts of starvation."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmer of blackmail malware is currently specifically targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 per cent of the companies were already the target of a Ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the solution required by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to blackmail ransom is significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes-CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place quickly in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as by archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and erases the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are interested in sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production still stands."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a Ransomware fails."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business activity, in a case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany several hospitals had already been victims of attacks, their patients could be threatened by the loss of patient acts."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure use the payload areas and contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims per chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must bargain and pay five-digit totals to retrieve their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V due to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening one rolls around eternally, at night it is long awake, in the morning, far from the wake-up, it is no longer necessary to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many underlying causes for them, stresses Hans-Günter Weeder, member of the board member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafford and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an in- and diarrhoea."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is just the falling asleep that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common especially during a depression," "says Weeder."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a hernia, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponders about everyday problems and worries, there is one example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one become a doctor with sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day, should go to the doctor, said Weert."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment may look quite different: it is downcast, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any sleep medical in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, when sleeping difficulties, one should first turn to the family doctor, said Weert."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, for examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise, for example, snoring with respiratory problems, in case of illness, in case of illness, in case of insomnia or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the sale, one goes to bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one is wearing a nasal rim, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts on: regular sleep and rising times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleeping, stop drinking alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="3">"on the facade of a grey house someone has" "ugly!" "sprayed."</seg>
<seg id="4">"opposite to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already built: until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new tenants will be built."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, however, in recent weeks, article about this" trendy district, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the occupants have rent contracts, on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior coordinator Henkel recorded several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area referred to as" no-go-zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patched official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three clubteam cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown landowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers pulled off under the cheating of sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain front Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main source of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, are primarily annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of increasing rents and centration."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who is interested in police protection from vandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior coordinator and the police force between home owners and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer street near the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been cleared under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and were still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the borough has become increasingly magnets for tourists and electors from all over the world in recent years: with them residents of GDR times and former home owners share their Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on designed discs or freshly painted facades that were discarded with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year as often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours can see this as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to criminal offences such as bodily injury, statistics are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes make property damages, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been destined."</seg>
<seg id="28">"even the famous burning cars, there are no longer there in Riga."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, the street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important that the residents got their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by jointing new buildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well infected here," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction cannot be seen absolutely." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you want to do if someone is never listening?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for breeding enthusiasts who are annoyed about color bombs: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the cutting-edge woollen jacket, which is above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less spotless than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant purposefully - meant as the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative expert with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a cutting-edge woollen cloth."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with local people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine's customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the follow-up refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the interconnection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is changed from the Land Registry to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search is very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in fact, the administration does not find any private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work so far, whether you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, communal dwellings must be erased as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers are set up in the Wasstrasse."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but only with apartments, it is not done."</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be conceived or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as reported by Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity means not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say deuscher and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here are administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedures is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they have to explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever develops the feeling, he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problem cases also, says customer honest," people, where nothing works. "therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is a" "mammoth task." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer clearly, "what some people may call naive." a risk could and may not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitized already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins killed them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine's client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach, where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbach are already busy, to integrate the previous people wisely."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, one must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
