Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ ehr@@ an dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal promoted by Obama for the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu , at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was part of an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to his election in Israel at that time . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , to have shot his girlfriend &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb spoke with a somewhat timi@@ d voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I am sorry I could reverse , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school site where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he was also a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; Lamb previously asked the Delta State University to leave a complaint for health reasons , and said that he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy mean that the promotion , for which Lamb worked so hard , would not guarantee a guarantee for an automatic path to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Mississi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran into the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he received his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool senior guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s s@@ warm then .
&quot; all girls were mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and P@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said Ms St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica qu@@ ill before a sp@@ her@@ ical audience . &quot;
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first term seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Ms. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated in the &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to make our students return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported on Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call was called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to set fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says there will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year but the toy and baby @-@ products dealer says that he will give the currently recru@@ ited employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
&quot; the company said it plans to stop 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . 4@@ 5,000 workers have been hired during the holiday season 2014 . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; the company said it will start with job interviews this month , and the number of employees increases from October to December . &quot;
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees selling , ship and supplying products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty beside me , and it is clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated g@@ äh@@ nen and a band length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had a premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s real for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; Un@@ str@@ anded the biggest time @-@ travel movie that was ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be featured on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie theatres in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; for almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the margins of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the face of the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
&quot; 8 survey values , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in poll@@ s down , it has ( still ) not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit area , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given guidance to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom also won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters are happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; angry , &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of Irish voters will believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first electoral state of the nation , the state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not pass into the White House , as ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their hus@@ bands , Republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four out of ten of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; however , a large number of GO@@ P voters show Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still propos@@ ing almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed over more than a dozen other Can@@ did@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that and no one can really say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 per cent said they left the door open to change to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump in the issue of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign for two months ago called immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; , &quot; the immigration pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse was in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano American will be far away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the new orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration is left in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will also do . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs up to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North sea .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a flat roof house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sylt , the range of objects is limited naturally , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter is the most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double keeper at Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave him a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Wit@@ ches of Pir@@ äus . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers twin pack ( 51 . / 90@@ . + 2 ) and G@@ ötz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; with his 28 hits in the Champions League , Müller received a ben@@ ign co @-@ operation of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had passed one of the world &apos;s eighth shot pe@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is @-@ Stadion in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ air fans - and the Munich stopped . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the royal class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European countries with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went courage@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts it was often too mon@@ stro@@ us to work . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often launched by reloc@@ ation to left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , who rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right than his fl@@ ank from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7. minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown beat the Pol@@ es head ball from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
then by direct de@@ commissioning to the Tor@@ wart Roberto with his knee ( 35@@ th ) .
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians went up their usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus could set con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
but at Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
&quot; for example , when he saw a shot of Ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; prior to Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had a qu@@ at@@ ch@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng defending it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was first sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after finishing the final training , &quot; &quot; said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; whoever wants to do something different from it is already vi@@ cious . &quot;
&quot; also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller continued on . &quot;
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partially m@@ um@@ ber@@ ed Bavaria fans apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pir@@ äus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with banners against the Munich tra@@ ilers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the good news : in the case of aband@@ on@@ ment , the risk is reduced rapidly . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely to get the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; root causes for tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to common gum infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment decl@@ ines again to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health even to the old age according to our findings .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study will substanti@@ ate the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet the banks of Cologne on rem@@ n@@ ants from the late Anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine .
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered a specialist for archae@@ ology preservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists have now found their way . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained to Trier . &quot;
&quot; besides rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs that probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman died at the train station in Gei@@ ers@@ gang @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman crossed the railway station towards railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by cap@@ turing the train , she carried he@@ avi@@ est injuries to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by emergency personnel .
&quot; over the cause of the ni@@ ghtly rail crossing of the young woman , there is no evidence of the medi@@ ator officials . &quot;
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to de@@ position the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement ( TTIP ) .
&quot; the disp@@ uted private lighting equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which in its mode of operation comp@@ lies significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; declared the Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on the idea . &quot;
the Swe@@ de presented the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP should be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure show con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot;
&quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the proceedings involved interven@@ ed among themselves on arbitr@@ ators , a possibility of objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long run , she wants to work towards an international investment course according to his own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the Investor @-@ State arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , over which companies le@@ verage damage to the tax@@ pay@@ ers , bul@@ b national laws or to impose a lowering of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act outlined the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it has been critic@@ ised that they should not be considered for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
the Commission considered important points in the reform that Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts may be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic potential of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains uncle@@ ar on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the timi@@ d real follow@@ er recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gri@@ pped by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells us about various places he repeat@@ ed@@ ely depic@@ ts on the map , about his min@@ u@@ cial and delicate arranged songs . &quot;
where they came from and how it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart @-@ composed songs appear wis@@ ely very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a twi@@ sted series : each of the 50 US states should be ob@@ s@@ essed . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot;

&quot; a year later , the musician returns to the series in New York . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Vo@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide celebrated masterpiece will be published in 2005 . &quot;

the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not in any yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; after a very productive experiment , St@@ ev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic parts . &quot;
&quot; this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs came up , the stage shows here become the colorful spectacle of Ne@@ on brow@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is a member of a five @-@ member band through Germany .

&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the much more mature st@@ ev@@ ens comes back to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album . &quot;
the audience li@@ stens to the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore disc@@ ard the &quot; record . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tions
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister &apos;s fac@@ tions . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frac@@ ture and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set the first of his six issues shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MEPs . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to pers@@ ist on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several stories stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says political differences can also be st@@ acked within Labour , namely by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of work and pensions , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory leader , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader who has promised another policy approach says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Isl@@ ington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too con@@ front@@ ational and that he will be subjected to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is on his way abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings . but a few years later , he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the British Prime Minister considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , even though critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would have far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound was rising according to data , which showed an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s bid objective . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v took over .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were up 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ t &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; Gl@@ enc@@ ore &apos;s shares increased by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a 4.3 % decrease after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had made his assessment for the company rating . &quot;
JD Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company announced a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the first half .
the head of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate for the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile arrived in Munich at the Patent Office in Munich .

Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches ground level campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ -
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and store shop@@ ke@@ epers selling cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor @-@ strategy day . &quot;
&quot; it is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
&quot; analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost some 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business lunch in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in terms of operating revenue and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler thri@@ ves and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to increase sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to deliver IG@@ A retailers to improve their shops through fast growing fresh foods and to deliver a better choice of private label food . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refurb@@ ishment programs are to be given to Elan , hoping that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and ear@@ ns more praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight by the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualification @-@ game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka could have sm@@ iled Cyr@@ gi@@ os and I should strike the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he struck a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp broke a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I am rather des@@ i@@ fer is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ os in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , stops refugees &quot;
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency , and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian civil servants with indign@@ ation .
&quot; the people who had fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations grew .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; and sh@@ rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot;
some refused food and water protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take another 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put their hopes on a bal@@ eful action of Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency stand out on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having finished a fence along the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage to the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for convic@@ ted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but Repor@@ ter by Associ@@ ated Press had already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ ony@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos embr@@ aced the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and press a crowd to penet@@ rate there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in arriving , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 per cent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he can candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pres@@ election . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed to which candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
Clinton holds a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates but these projections have decreased .
&quot; their support in the men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has become volati@@ le , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage with the elderly voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections state that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support it with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support it because it is the nomin@@ ee .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support it .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about its leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president will be ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ encies are also cited .
&quot; as the Vice @-@ President re@@ jects a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head will be ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has decreased by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about the constitu@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters to vote as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important tra@@ its among voters in the pre @-@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being asked as Minister of Foreign Affairs during the term of office , most democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it does not affect their opinions overall . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans are now un@@ happy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this remains a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of eligible voters will also see Tr@@ ump as dish@@ on@@ est and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes on the leader@@ board . &quot;
&quot; between the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not think of him . &quot;
the failure rate for the sample of 351 German voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the report provides detailed information on M@@ erg@@ ers and Ac@@ quis@@ itions , Equity / Deb@@ t Off@@ er@@ ings , Private Equity , Venture Financing and Partnership transactions recorded by the company over a five year period . &quot;
but Car@@ son spent the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demo@@ graphical groups and sur@@ ren@@ ders Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can elec@@ tors with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ es , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % in third place . &quot;
the fault margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - he lands with 19 % support among the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest ABC News / Washington Post was also showing Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising up in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing tourists to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , assass@@ inations are filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and was attacked repeatedly while trying to move over a frozen field to a target . &quot;
&quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ sil and put the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with bl@@ unt power . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood . at least one student died since 1970 each year at the chic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third tier for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with suspic@@ ious attacks and the formation of a criminal organization . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest
&quot; a interest increase comes , and the hous@@ ings will fall into re@@ fuel , returns to bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the economy . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial assets react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so v@@ ehem@@ ently stressed that investors should not concentrate on increasing interest rates , but rather on the time period needed for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement was probably exagger@@ ated because of interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal to the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest expenses can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in more detail , the market in the past 35 years is mostly up @-@ to @-@ date - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , has been published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to occur later in the increase cycle , while the return on return begins to decrease . &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but they often promote interest rates .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; remark@@ ably , the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest charges since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest expenses in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants were prepared for a interest rate of the F@@ ed all year long , and all eyes were focused at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only gives a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all In@@ cre@@ ased cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ed before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ism very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in stocks if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first increase / decrease is done in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the bond markets fell straight away , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles S@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer tigh@@ tening of returns between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a down@@ turn of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones said that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit tigh@@ tening have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large enterprises , which ent@@ ail major part of their business activities in the USA , benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debt will be worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond to extremely positive three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
firm of the Year for Distribution and Fran@@ ch@@ ising Os@@ borne Clar@@ ke Firm of the Year for Employment Fresh@@ fields Bruck@@ haus Der@@ inger Firm of the Year for Insurance
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains through higher yields , even if experts in different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the broad@@ c@@ aster because of its &quot; &quot; de@@ duction &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the mission The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , claims a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public legal radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ me &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like using the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontan@@ eously named examples , where you can only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director dism@@ issed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and inform@@ ing the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , finding new music and commissioned new works , I really consider important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work was needed to engage audiences as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC @-@ production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports for it was under fire to step into the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC that was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ .
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future , or to give money for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales rose in August on slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of the Great Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ uting , and we will probably see that growth decreases . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decl@@ ining revenues .
&quot; experts believe that buyers hold their purchases before this event , which takes place last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites rus@@ hed off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that 5 £ expenditure was issued a little more than £ 1 online .

Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia sh@@ uts down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane rus@@ hed
hundreds of Muslims assembled when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed who were killed as a crane on Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandmother .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to declare their respect when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession passed on to the holy site , where only days before a building crane had collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the concrete . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s building because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , imposed a sanc@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beds , which were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the great central mo@@ ch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , was in support of the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca , with thousands who continue to come to the city , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised what caused the overthrow of the crane that rus@@ hed into a large @-@ mo@@ ck courtyard , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround m@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ cha as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dec@@ eit@@ ful son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said 158 people stayed in the hospital .
&quot; government officials said that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other wounded will receive half of this amount .

&quot; it is claimed that Brit@@ ons lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out the work in their home , &quot;

&quot; King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ bugs Shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop are taken by women . &quot;
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to exhibit the growing demographic trends that have more feminine single households , make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot;
we have to shift this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Ms. Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also been brief@@ ing her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial support . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important issue . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and turnover , after the group owed the cost of closing the stores . &quot;
&quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also been indic@@ ted for office abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , preliminary investigations were made clear that the def@@ endants received mon@@ ies from club accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he will damage the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ats , Jud@@ ge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence argued that at no time an asset was created . &quot;
&quot; sports officials only charged expenses for allowance and the sports club , which they have been operating from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money from debt , the liabilities came to 600@@ ,000 scar@@ ves in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were standing in front of the situation : do we run the club or shut ourselves up ? &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants told the chief occup@@ ier of the chief financial officer in the bread profession . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have advanced money , lay down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said at the capture . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debt . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , in case of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the expenses allowance was decided retro@@ actively by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was depos@@ ited on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump @-@ sum and non @-@ detailed explanations , the former Ob@@ man explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and saving books were administered together by the two def@@ endants , the second def@@ endant said . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not published in detail in detail , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association did not interest in details for the financial engagement , important was the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one functional investigation into office abuse , an amount of € 1@@ 20.000 was transferred to the Club &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , declared the def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant , and was not known according to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , finally , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room . &quot;
&quot; the compl@@ ain@@ ant was informed , justified himself to the function@@ ary . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; compensation claim . &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fication ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ endant explained that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the society was never damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the function@@ ary , he never obtained a cent salary , he counted only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he added 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort has been much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documents for the early years could not show the def@@ endants .
&quot; these were not kept in place after a trial , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all dwell@@ ings are in cash , and he said in his statement from his dom@@ ic@@ ile to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard starts another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the personnel mining that has been running for three years , the Compu@@ Stra@@ ight will have further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the sub@@ missions at the U.S. computer terri@@ fying Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate divisions . &quot;
&quot; thus , costs amoun@@ ting to USD 2.@@ 7@@ bn ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the disman@@ tling of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the past three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 300,000 associates . &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard &apos;s share was 2.3 percent later .
&quot; the Group from California Pal@@ o Alto , with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led even more in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC he@@ el as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers , according to its services , set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo recently . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; thus , the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP answers the changes in the industry with a spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and always do business online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total of around 5@@ 5,000 points . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : break@@ age at the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police campaig@@ ned at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ lights against several hundred standing refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind the police line there was a police line and behind the polic@@ emen a floo@@ d@@ light was ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially put on pepper spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now waited a little while .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried .
other refugees bag@@ ged themselves and suffered under the breath of breathing .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US note bank is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make an important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade interest has been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation where a large central bank might leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the indications suggest that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death Con@@ tri@@ bution at Delta State University left ap@@ ology
&quot; after the firing and killing of his girlfriend in Mississi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he would &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; on the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could not do it &quot; , &quot; gave authorities known on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , I have shot a man , and someone killed . &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , which will &quot; &quot; nobody b@@ other &quot; , &quot; but will probably be ag@@ itated . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when the police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb ran 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were killing him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and P@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed . &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when police captured him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb ran his car and ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; Lamb received a doc@@ torate from Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his curriculum vit@@ alizes on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who lost their fortune
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ res@@ ome years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor has allegedly tried to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was condemned for drug possession . &quot;
all this is certainly challenging his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the approximately 1,000 executives worldwide will cost the Group restructuring to the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evaluating the low @-@ light Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the objective of the real@@ ignment was an earnings contribution of some 500 million euros per year for cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; for this , the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible . &quot;
&quot; in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ aud will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the management team headed by CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Group , which represents three quarters of annual revenues of € 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective conflict with the pilot association cock@@ pit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the qu@@ ashed strike . &quot;
this shared the union .
the topic of the talks shall be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit wants to come as quickly as possible to load @-@ bearing results . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , the conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the transition supply of the pilots , the concept &quot; Wings &quot; is in the background . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is taking part in the Group &apos;s own bil@@ let line Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ tures
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left external def@@ ender to the crying and exp@@ end it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was lost in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double bass structure and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then the six months will take , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f meter and a red card are due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I &apos;ll get back stronger . &quot;
related : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the British Def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the room with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg breaking when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad hurt , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad in doing so . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital after a f@@ oul@@ tery by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the prime minister chose The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead re@@ prints a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of T@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted is hoping to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if it were not yet worthy enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partially like the summary of the Lor@@ pa@@ x movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted is hoping to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar to the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ person said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s staff , but gave no immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not finish a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batch list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; message referred to here : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England Test @-@ K@@ ader , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer is focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I &apos;ve said this forward - players are their own best choices . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire are coming out , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that didn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question how much time a test perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er gets to put his mark is difficult .
&quot; lyrics got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first placed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer I treasure .
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very well . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this naturally depends on the position of men in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ spin and receive four ticks , di@@ ved up , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ th@@ and has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he immediately managed three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics on an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inning that lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few wise additions to the Train@@ erst@@ ab . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and te@@ amm@@ ates do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you have to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Des@@ cen@@ sion of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy went into a Fl@@ au@@ te until 2017

we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are climbing up at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants a UK @-@ looking UK inside the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and civil servants came to the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exc@@ essi@@ vely long endurance as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande is looking at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are going to take a leg to help the self @-@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally plan no more helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won none of its value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone , as it did during the referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ line ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his cra@@ ft@@ iness , Ed knew Mili@@ band who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sm@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking aliens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ countries that have most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air thought similar about them , but noted that when sitting in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , better ban@@ anas are distributed to di@@ stract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ ms because Bl@@ air had put the principle on the non @-@ passed constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never dec@@ eived him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly sla@@ p on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time to waste me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional anti @-@ fuel tendency and wild rab@@ ies of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ men can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and members after all reports on their clause on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron a free map for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the paper campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son firmly believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic ause Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; last month , an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
&quot; two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said the public anticip@@ ates that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are approximately 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria @-@ making analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to bring their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director prior to British American Tob@@ acco Monitoring ( BA@@ T ) should have received an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes maker , but not the funding he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International according to reports beforehand . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a sector funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the Tob@@ acco leadership took part . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ is@@ cated &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products with most criteria , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of p@@ he that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; were premature .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been responded beforehand . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System $ 2 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard @-@ disp@@ uted time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC Secretary General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least put its production on programs that others do not do or put on commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as much support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to do so . &quot;
I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give it back what former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ enders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where one fairly can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue when they go to their apparent commis@@ sions for justification of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcasting fee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , we all think that one gets a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of BBC @-@ production would be officially classified as education - he said it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada , &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial broadcasting alli@@ ances go to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically altered ne@@ ural systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they have sound impulses , which for the human ear have too high frequencies to be heard . &quot;
&quot; impulses work by turning mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultrasound waves . &quot;
read more about this topic : read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms demonstrated the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths @-@ brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with , such as a report of Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ ions carry the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bes and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired position in the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily suscep@@ tible human neur@@ ons suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are to be seen at bus stations and in the subway trains and which require a second look . &quot;
important announcement : drive from 15th to 18th September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the font types of London Underground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line which turns into the picture of a tank .
&quot; in September , a flock of weapons dealers will travel with the DL@@ R ... Custom@@ ers will be asked to help stop the tru@@ ce fair . &quot;
the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel Designs in Ban@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
&quot; a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution in London and used &quot; &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks &quot; , &quot; a 6 £ pack of bus keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one @-@ third of bus stops on the planet . &quot; &quot;

&quot; according to G@@ avin Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and Lec@@ turer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries . &quot;
many artists work with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to go outside to the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapon badges greet the commuters on the subway .
&quot; the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist , who also works for free . &quot;
&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising for the weapons trade - through a lead of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic ru@@ st@@ ful company advertising , but &quot; through the shr@@ ubs with bright colors and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us shar@@ pen the awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a stri@@ ding of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the tru@@ ce fair dates from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors rally fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago I went into a student residence as self @-@ for@@ get@@ table 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to the residence halls extends from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to w@@ it : people tell where you get , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms often turn into beverages recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people prefer to wear and press their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ prayer culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I consume for interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a com@@ milit@@ ant is exhausted by soci@@ alizing , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking . &quot;
speaking apro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
&quot; as you start the Uni at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of Brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have made you a little bit baked . so , and now please smile as I give you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat suggest that people make themselves sleeping when you tick . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the claw of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if there was something to give them a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music and closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally enter the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be quite embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ ommate for your future spouse , take care of her , separate herself and see her again every day and perhaps witness how she over@@ takes all of the common friends . &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to introduce a little reason to your abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that somebody has got his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and har@@ ass@@ ment is fine as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good grasp is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety , but never do any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door and put their keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not ch@@ ew their poss@@ essions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ paying , Ger@@ ing@@ compressed &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ homes for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential homes , but also the mother and the ear@@ ners alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds on terrac@@ ed houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terrac@@ ed house is the solution . &quot;
guil@@ ds : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when one puts people in blocks of living .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be adapted easily according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; deb@@ tors : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ deb@@ tor : &quot; &quot; legally I have gone through my project correctly . &quot;
&quot; especially complicated , it always makes the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kul@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the slot ordin@@ ance ordin@@ ance . &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ rated , who in a row house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the local residents react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
deb@@ tors : there were those who imagined to create luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but are you not tigh@@ tening the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; in the last five years we had a boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght will go back or try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may imply the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by simpli@@ fying the update . likewise , it will be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it pays to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may turn off half way , and this could lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of the update . &quot;

&quot; you should also make sure you have seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things before your download to prevent things going wrong and protect themselves if they do it . iOS 9 brings new functions , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system . &quot;

&quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg , in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , knows only one motto : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup Team stressed that I had nothing to lose . &quot;

&quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member to his ranks so that the number of members rose to 19 players . &quot;

&quot; the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation , which President Alfred Klein received . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who can not record the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent research should also be promoted .
&quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his clos@@ eness with the spa town . &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the old centre of Alten@@ ist@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new address at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new district office .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ í@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the retirement centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention , and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the sen@@ iors Centre for Care and Care , &quot; explained Heike R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre shows both business leaders especially in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
&quot; in addition , the Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ büro also dedic@@ ates himself to the meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
&quot; thus , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as much as possible . &quot;
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 pm , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one from the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the altitude of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men now sh@@ ou@@ ted the young people and hit this with the fist .
the victim suffered a no@@ str@@ ils and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the r@@ ack@@ et , he first left his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and demonstr@@ atively drove past several times there .
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went out front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
&quot; with the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a v@@ ague work description is available . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field@@ breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; in addition , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also delighted . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1st . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing next to his successor in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympath@@ etic at first glance , when the standing out of years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who are currently completing her speci@@ alization in the Ver@@ den Hospital , will also want to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I simply called her . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the gar@@ bage men bought the house with practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller has also grown up , his medical studies in Hannover followed several stations in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , Germany . in 2009 he was appointed head physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is involved in voluntary work in the DRC @-@ willingness fr@@ enz@@ burg @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; starting September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as pets . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ building , the rooms will look modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 500@@ 00 Euros will receive the gar@@ bage collection in the framework of a funding programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes Sam@@ ar@@ itan mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , about 2000 patients come into the field of field breaks every quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practice over@@ taking by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in As@@ endorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; if there was no successor , it would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , those who visit Müller &apos;s consultation hours , inci@@ dentally , also look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialties and the cleaning power of the fel@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; with their par@@ ting ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years there . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel says . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly she feels after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will surely see them , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband laugh@@ ed laugh@@ ingly : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 m2 plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pushed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also taken up at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; on the other hand , it is clear that everyone who wants to make asylum is &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs distinct signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia har@@ bours &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling in direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see this in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already highly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to make its borders to refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; any EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; says Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government told , the first refugees had already attempted to enter Eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police allowed them to take up in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has constantly met police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country with some 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border were diver@@ ted to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but the government in Belgrade denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a slightly further west section . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive limits to border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perform rig@@ orous checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country since then , concerning the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still uncle@@ ar .
&quot; Wednesday morning , the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic appe@@ aled to so@@ ot@@ he the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not currently be a very high number of refugees .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn up by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock exchange h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who are accused of having gained an insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information collected , insi@@ der @-@ shops are to be made at the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators were given a total of more than 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately tr@@ apped , &quot; it says in the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trial against 32 additional charges in the case lasted .
most of the def@@ endants were taken from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a busy operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; people do their concerns , partly fast stri@@ de , partly cozy bum@@ bling . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim aut@@ os@@ al@@ lion at the parking place .
city rail@@ ways hold .
&quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ all@@ uring life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of the middle four large boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to ... &quot;
&quot; the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid made it aware of its 20 @-@ year existence with this action , and is entirely confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well for questions and conversations as the voluntary employees .
&quot; while some people spontan@@ eously enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ate to the chal@@ k and read the sentence about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , there are small discussions about the action on themselves , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world will come to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bear@@ er of ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot;
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to share on the tablets , is understandable , but ultimately it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with Tab@@ us , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up people . &quot;
an assessment that divi@@ des Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; faced with the topic of personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid was seeking volunteers , she immediately reported that she was involved in the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hosp@@ ice St. Vincent . &quot;
all are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle well with her job and experience and experience .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ p , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ances and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the mort@@ g@@ ages and ob@@ itu@@ aries .
all two years are offered training courses for new employees .

Fed@@ Ex result bl@@ ended , financial outlook for 2016 reduced &quot;
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter and the delivery giant lowered his profit margin over a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation time . &quot;
the share fell by over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Corp. told us to earn a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and € 10@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in May , 20 cent less than at previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; despite the price increases , the lower view comes in spite of price increases , which will be at an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ transporting of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company considers &quot; solid yields when considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex consolidated 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which were forec@@ asting twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research analysts . &quot;

&quot; over the past few years , Fed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipping that brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales of bo@@ d@@ transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while earnings decreased because of higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares sank by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on the most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen is spending two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time for the first time for almost a decade to raise the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
&quot; above them at one end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat sa@@ ws there is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed @-@ chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it is announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented rate of interest since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is sound growing , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global marketplace is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted this week &apos;s interest rate .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the blow by promising that a further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Index j@@ umped by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that it won &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a interest increase would calm the financial markets , because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; even before a month , the F@@ ed seemed good ways to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would require more economic progress , an increase in the movement . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation went steadily under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can master higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial verage value fell by more than 16 % below its top level , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would crum@@ ble global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , but the Dow is now around 10 % below the level of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence impacts complex calculation , when interest is to increase . &quot;
&quot; if the events in the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Not@@ en@@ bank . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the effects on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere reference of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , dissolved conf@@ usions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , observed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; acker , vo@@ iced member of the Federal Open Market Committee , argued for a interest increase , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its cor@@ p@@ se by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited visible effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should point out aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , &quot; said Adam S. Poz@@ nan , a former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest increase because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time . &quot;
need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of view and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and c@@ rock@@ ery , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les . &quot;
&quot; if the whole purchasing process makes you hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the kitchen ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the coff@@ ers and has various tak@@ eover options .
what is there : need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even cook on demand for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer . here you can find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ ing , whole du@@ cks , fish , cattle shed , fish balls , regional saus@@ ages , commercial foods and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here a : restaurant owner and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide gears are suitable for shopping trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : young Refu@@ ge@@ es for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , does not go without the engagement of countless volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot;
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she does it in the asylum seek@@ er at the Dill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande encourages diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ried Sports Hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ longed gymn@@ as@@ tics building at the Bern@@ ese sports ground are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent assembly session , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously lowered without any major discussions . &quot;
&quot; the committee , among other things , submitted an application to an &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; of the valid cultivation plan . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; exception , &quot; it was the permission of a special form relating to the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof over@@ hau@@ ls &quot; should be established . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; in turn , it was about the ti@@ lt , which for energy reasons - different from the cultivation plan stipul@@ ated - should be below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because there were no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; with regard to the slope - although the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally drives more restric@@ tive on liber@@ ating requests . &quot;
&quot; however , during gymn@@ as@@ tics construction however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
at the expense of approximately 2.3 million Euros are calculated .
supplements are expected from school and broad@@ band support .
&quot; in the next procedure , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Regional Office for examination . &quot;
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of the employees move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the land@@ lady Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will take place on Wednesday 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing inner station .
the rooms are present .
&quot; employees who are not able to work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has caused the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; with the question of who to follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead as of 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in every case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
f@@ isher is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the In@@ ner Station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years Fischer will be appointed with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to the two houses , until next year the former hospital of the squ@@ ad , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 if the current refurb@@ ishment was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß land@@ lady , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came against rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ appe , will in future be used as shelter for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I conclude that . as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ dream psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi removal to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .

&quot; in the last season the Bad@@ ener had a gri@@ ev@@ ous defeat at the B@@ HC , and made some dirty things there . &quot;
hunting - with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the ab@@ err@@ ation on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use , as the police shared . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how accurate it could come to the accident , was at first uncle@@ ar . &quot;
the crime police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
&quot; in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that teenagers were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violence . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also considered to be active in the Tuesday evening , according to the alleg@@ ations , and the investig@@ ators lead to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported to be missing on Sunday mor@@ nings after they did not come home on the eve after a visit of a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first bite on personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the arrest occurred in the police inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the cor@@ p@@ ses placed in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented on Wednesday to the har@@ sh@@ er , the investig@@ ators put a dead end to him . &quot;
the further investigation will take place on the near@@ er circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing land
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction faces a challenge .
the distribution matches on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers coming from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; compared to this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first emergency accommodation . &quot;
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policies of recent years .
&quot; Germany is moving a housing deficit , which will grow from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently around 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study compl@@ ains . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in big cities not@@ ched in flat @-@ room rooms .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the flute on the housing market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; suggests a restart . &quot;
new incentives are to boost the social housing construction again .
&quot; in this way , the tax tax will be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the alliance . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters for the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros was already rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia establish a corridor
&quot; in Hungary , practically no diar@@ rho@@ ea is coming , more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing its passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported to the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , are also practically super@@ flu@@ ous in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity .
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country . &quot;
&quot; most of the media reports are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have been temp@@ ted to walk on the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach the border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees to go to Hungary . &quot;
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before the deadline on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the Over@@ coming and Dam@@ age of the Border Guard as a criminal off@@ ense .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the sentenced thre@@ aten to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; , &quot; of which nearly all - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be depor@@ ted there .
only a few hundred refugees were gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers begin to clean up .
they collected waste that had left tens of thousands of people over the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the shooting stores in the bor@@ dering was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; the 20,000 migrants were still staying in the country according to government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , there met regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing , when there were suddenly ten people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly hired the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames with two additional hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we have only appe@@ aled the unexpected guests with a snack or a drink . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels , the str@@ anded train passengers switched from an ICE into a regional train direction Pass@@ au , in order to try it after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still to try over the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was dropped off the border into W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ festival association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able , on the day before a two @-@ bridge sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; now that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us , a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy is : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help build structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor officially and publicly put the position of the Hungarian government into the dun@@ geon of National Socialism . &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; the refugees will also realise that the &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed us , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , in which we produce decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5,000 w@@ inters &quot;
&quot; with the provision of refugees , Konrad has all hands full to do . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the housing of the 20,000 refugees arriving in Austria on Monday was without great tur@@ mo@@ il , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ y year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found over the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capitals .
they would have assured him to create lod@@ gings even for the refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
&quot; in the morning , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator also demands great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards of accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that lod@@ gings have to hold a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the overhead . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot;
&quot; that he was more successful in contrast to the Ministry of Interior at his accommodation , Konrad reas@@ oned with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without doubt the un@@ truth . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to have any costs , as they explained . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; until now , his own artistic search has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to put a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
the city of Linz is planning not to open municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees .
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently susp@@ end those affected without these measures , &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the city chief has critic@@ ised the distribution of refugees inside the federal state . &quot;
other districts also need to make their contribution here .
&quot; sea @-@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; borders are not sailed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zes further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , Austria is now &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; Die Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ zeile is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT @-@ Group S &amp; T is dra@@ fted , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in startup companies of the new ship@@ yard , and later to acquire them . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; D wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; EUR 1.7 million was invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is desp@@ ised by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
&quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la Hand@@ bags are the centre of attention . &quot;
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arc@@ ades : after all , it has now received an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop , in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of its own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has received Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many woman in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in decoration , can also not answer the expert woman with last security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is used .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ ker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects man@@ holes to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether it is alien@@ ated hostile to journalists , journalists are concerned or gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fris@@ ur is a concept for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ village is related to it about -@@ zig @-@ corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
what do vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt kind , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , to which besides Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the King of the Hear@@ ts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to think that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dently the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ ac &quot; &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundations of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; however , the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared a film start . &quot;
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
it repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter il@@ licit immigrants .
&quot; just like the pol@@ y , it is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was borrow@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension @-@ go@@ ddess Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz donated something for the church organ at a visit , which is generally well ank@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t expect the election , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the legends at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are ripe , even without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; W@@ end@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump was inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 film cat@@ chers , even in the USA the interest is w@@ aking up . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavaria municipality Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park on Wednesday received the award for Sustainable Tourism . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain sti@@ cker villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the village is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .

&quot; Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was aired by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the pres@@ enters David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators in the five capitals , compared to the today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18.@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9,000 viewers to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial port of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck easily The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) was the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e on average 44@@ 6.000 visitors . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;

the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery reveals ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows next day before out of three two , you possibly acci@@ dentally gave a note on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood resol@@ ves his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have a ly@@ rical way of explaining why Wood is the perfect man , and they called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers become a game trou@@ bling , who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot;
je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki were both quick - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and realizing ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I sens@@ ed that they were fairly compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah faces both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be suitable as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood could be the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls in the same way - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30@@ pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle demonstrated great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams who sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
&quot; some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game , when he lost an angel as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ rug@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first p@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ unt return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly during his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first play area of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings . &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian crew had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass was leading to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al region .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; due to the high number of refugees , Free voters demand the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn class in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and fac@@ tional leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not new teachers corresponding to the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get obj@@ ections in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Sunday fraction of the free voters conven@@ es until Friday in the Francon@@ ian Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum is to over@@ lay the exam , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Security Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as existed during the Yugosla@@ v Wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters Chef . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more personnel for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum in@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW MD critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistently : &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing long @-@ standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; at the new school year , the German Minister of Education Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; &quot; in 47 gymn@@ asi@@ ums , where an extension of the secondary school of three to four years will be tested - in the result it will take nine years to the Ab@@ itur . &quot;
but this does not go far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the FW boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ tics that want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
wall Street helps D@@ ax to jumps on jumps
&quot; after a long distance , the German stock market has made a seamless and nervous trading course with winn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a strong start to the U.S. stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points . &quot;
M@@ DA@@ X in medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

&quot; the Euro@@ St@@ ox@@ x 50 as Lei@@ c@@ dex of the euro area declined by 1.01 percent to 320@@ 7,@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also posted trading places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Sustainability Index recorded around 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the debate about the bur@@ dens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E into a record low , leaving deep traces on E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon stocks rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax point .
&quot; according to a retail@@ er , a positive report from the US startup magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors gave little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
investment in future w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were again ab@@ used than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
autom@@ akers Daimler and BMW accoun@@ ted for 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits de@@ vil@@ ed by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; on the German pension market , the return on the exchange rate fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0,50 per cent ) . &quot;
the income index Re@@ x increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
&quot; the Federal Government lost 0,@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4,@@ 11 points . &quot;
&quot; in the afternoon , the course of the Euro fell to $ 1,@@ 12@@ 62 . &quot;
&quot; at mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber missi@@ les on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after police demonstrated rubber missi@@ les into a crowd , demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , some 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Head of the District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before returning to rubber missi@@ les . &quot;
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber missi@@ les , known by those that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern states , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ igh@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be restored .
the city is currently preparing everything for the commerci@@ alization of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; a mix of trade , commerce and living is planned - but there are no concrete proposals yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Old Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the ground for a mixture of trade , commercial and residential . &quot;
&quot; looking for appropriate offers , it is said by the city . &quot;
&quot; what investor question is , is not yet clear . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the ring road / corner Great road , already bought a few months ago and let the building be disman@@ tled . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plant@@ ations for housing estate at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several tra@@ ilers are further worried - they fear the sale of their Freizei@@ tzentrum
&quot; for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday homes settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den enterprise &quot; System construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ de Council for the first time . &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , who accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends from the system construction management into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euros has been in discussion for months .
&quot; sharp reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the images and new details about the hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ landlord and board member of the interests representation of the tra@@ ilers , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like many other project critics that traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase strongly , &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come , so that it counts , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is happening on the well one hect@@ are of the former inn , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still was missing , the development plans were also variable . &quot;

twin @-@ bir@@ ths are rare with gor@@ illas .
&quot; the last one in a German zoo is nearly 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967 , it is called the Zoo . &quot;
&quot; the sex of the new@@ born gor@@ illa @-@ tw@@ ins still does not stand firm , since mother Di@@ an has so far kept her close to the body . &quot;

Google launches campaign donations to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ money campaign to help the thousands of refugees who over@@ roll the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the Don@@ ate call on his blog .
&quot; instead of giving a manager the announcement , Rita M@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / refuge@@ es@@ worth to 11 million $ .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven over 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also escaped from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years O@@ bes@@ ity sur@@ geri@@ es have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out among people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data gathered in a study since 2007 and compare two types of O@@ bes@@ ity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who did not receive surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who had under@@ gone surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease broke out completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with diabetes , it dissolved completely only at one percent and partly with only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood glucose levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ omy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.4 vs 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.3 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went an obesity drug , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is gaining attention at this time in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ attractive , meets the sho@@ al of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
so even in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and is pleased that she could establish a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take up all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford that devot@@ es itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama comm@@ ended Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , primarily through education that can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence and that has prov@@ oked unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centres in the U.S. report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ low strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 were reporting poison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
show videos on YouTube how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic m@@ outh@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( Hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in inf@@ ants , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would leave no si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es of straw@@ berry sc@@ ented hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ acked her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors were supervised by night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl fell through the alcohol and met the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; over alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ective agents containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the 4th grade planned to po@@ ise their &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police saw the tar@@ nished plan as &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three cars damaged
&quot; in the case of a coll@@ ision accident on the cross @-@ gap between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was easily injured in a rear accident . &quot;
&quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove towards the industrial area in the cross sp@@ ange , and it was too late that there were two preceding cars at the round@@ about . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a stand@@ alone Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the accidents involving accidents involving damage to accidents involving around 10,000 euros , the police split . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish Football bor@@ es Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former Rang@@ ers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show any highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the old property .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ law games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around the things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands out with five points lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel that exactly like this - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;
standing now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously with January @-@ transfers

&quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage will be done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole in the same period rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the occupation in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost a year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death Chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ous inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
who is selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; have better form@@ ulate it , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I had said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and I will see him dying from this perspective .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase talks to get out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he was talking to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; &quot; persu@@ ade him &quot; &quot; to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed on Tuesday to a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ dor@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good police officer . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to escape an alcohol control and then tried to float over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspir@@ ational natives to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that the Racing Victoria ste@@ wards tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s ste@@ wards and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ tenor dress rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations , and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go about raised head , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
Moo@@ dy had previously dropped the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his st@@ ables .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that &apos;s the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ anen , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have cow@@ ard@@ ly beha@@ ved and makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the train@@ ee &apos;s frustr@@ ations have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation of Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to he said that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the imper@@ is@@ hable Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ tor , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
&quot; it would have been so yesterday all day , which was like that . &quot;
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the racing day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after the flight is arrested
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a crash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent rac@@ er flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley motorway .
the police said the driver continued to stop without stopping to help the injured driver .
on Monday there was a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from Nath@@ alia the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be accused of driver acc@@ ru@@ ed and abandoned assistance and charged with other transport charges .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy turns against ri@@ val due to claims on ring struggles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the Storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm &apos;s victory in Sydney &apos;s qualifying fin@@ als on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett did a little cau@@ tious re@@ mark on the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy defended his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; while tac@@ kling .
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team gave him confidence , because they were worried that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this happens again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring competitions , when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . &quot;
it is funny as this always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; thrilling football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our on Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
&quot; or are breaks , and do not points a little bit of excitement ? &quot;
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has free this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; beer with 200,000 $ deposit after drug ad@@ diction &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly thre@@ aten a lifetime penalty for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gled up to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants at the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police over his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ lu@@ ent declarations of the two individuals , it is clear that the issue of a safety of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against damage , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , regi@@ sters daily with the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
&quot; at a rear @-@ end accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday night . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid , at the last moment , to the left , as the police split . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing plan completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours to 2 am .
&quot; there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a teacher used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when this slept , log@@ ically turned into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the dor@@ man@@ t H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed immediately her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; concerning &quot; &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches , which used terms for the search for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet , &quot; and he then pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment un@@ attached pictures of children on 14 June last year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked for H@@ og@@ g to not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his behaviour . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was given a deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was taken up before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are accessed from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ ders let people from fear of discovery and arrest multiply men at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up along the river river Inn in Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were on foot via bridges and fire@@ arms to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and for@@ warded to the registration .
&quot; according to the Federal Police Department at Munich Main Station , more and more refugees arrived at the beginning of the week on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people arrived at the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said one speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : drop off of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of Stur@@ mb@@ ö@@ en in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , distributed by Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who had gone over the Atlantic in recent days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
violent storms and storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , even until Thursday early in the Black Forest , at the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom @-@ sea circle with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 km of kilometres . &quot;
on Friday you can see the sun again .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car manufacturers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is above all movement in the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accoun@@ ted for this segment alone in August alone . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( Public Days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; so that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is not supposed to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel makes an entry to the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially available as a five @-@ door Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can already be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be done next to the Astra at the IA@@ A on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five door in a conventional and under@@ lined sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he comes early next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan de@@ posit@@ er wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact infin@@ iti fits into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 that can be seen at the IA@@ A .
outside the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger laid hands on the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights with LED technology were fitted .
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was primarily moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants like the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I have been added . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this made the Federal Constitutional Court decision on a decision that was published on Wednesday .
the parties concerned can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office because of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional judges rejected the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for renewed examination . &quot;
they see the human dignity of the man injured .
the Court of Appe@@ al therefore decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive for the repar@@ ation period , a compensation of compensation was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a wor@@ sen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; thus they spoke only in April a prisoner of damage , because he was locked in a cell in the nude . &quot;
&quot; according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also deser@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have come into the head@@ lines because of lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , prisoners are always locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even for r@@ ack@@ ets , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Jus@@ tiz@@ Express est@@ elle , 21 points in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the offspring shortage , 19 are to fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is to be done in Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the German Federal Ministry of Justice this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that .
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built until now ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing , however , is dramatic , but especially for paid rent objects : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social flats are out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Environment Minister agree that there must also be more tax rul@@ ings for investments in housing construction .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not systematically ask themselves systematically after their qualification to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from work ban for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled workers , the point of view prev@@ ails that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing German knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often im@@ par@@ ted by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the building of networks is based on the view from the Königs@@ weg ( Königs@@ weg ) for work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration stated that only a few parents gave their children to Kit@@ as , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the parent @-@ born parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zy@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ rails in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increased sharp@@ ly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the following countries , students will be prepared for classes without a knowledge of German language skills . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have qualifications in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School Department . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
student @-@ willing refugees may be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a state of residence or de@@ ul@@ sion do not get any services after the asylum seek@@ er performance law , if they start a study . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter does not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since it does not fall under the circle of the authorised persons . &quot;
&quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely move the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches law shall continue to develop into a new state religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who cares about the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner . &quot;
rights also include obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him some control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination position and a general equality law for a decade . &quot;
&quot; but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U @-@ series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German are calling for a long time and what international tre@@ aties such as the anti@@ racism convention in Germany must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and should use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees so far , says Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for some power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money ought to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards immediately . &quot;
provided services could later be rep@@ uted with the federal states .
&quot; in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to send so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors make the language barriers in particular . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more po@@ orer about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over , she demands . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have already been helped with more general medical check @-@ ups in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; in the case of refugee children , there are significantly more untreated disability , and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other disease pictures , German physicians come from their formation but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned , even relief in sight is possible by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , several refugees were even physicians . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly ex@@ ert tests again . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; particularly vulnerable are refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who are suffering from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate , and death @-@ fear@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration distur@@ ban@@ ces , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social offices may submit a request for a psych@@ otherapy , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; &quot; passion &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst pic@@ ks up on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream up in the arena .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the actual production of the real estate . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift to the spiritu@@ alists lies in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to pick up people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ ck@@ tails with Welt@@ stadt @-@ flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family moves the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to take up the Cuban Duo loos@@ ely . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with t@@ act and joint . &quot;
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
fel@@ low@@ men fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and fascin@@ ates others and fascin@@ ates with her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it &apos;s not good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are called loving , will be retri@@ eved by the eyes of every desire . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want it into the arena . &quot;
the highest commandment is good for the animals .
&quot; especially on its zeb@@ roid , Jum@@ bo , a mix of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst tells . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or one hundred viewers , we always do our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
&quot; from September 17 to 20 , the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances every day from 17 to 20 o &apos;clock . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal watch is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations made by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with her . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians had received SMS messages on their phones they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament ends , and once they leave Parliament their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard starts building up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25.000 to 30.000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
&quot; HP will be divided into two publicly listed companies this year , separating the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP president and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and profound portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the revers@@ al from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and as far as his rehabilitation was according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of its history , his involvement in the next summer is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd shows 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 league games in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the injuries stage . &quot;
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a time frame , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d in lieu of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players that need a little break off , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al are clear favor@@ ites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , where 3,@@ 2 were measured on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by far @-@ reaching hope , with his management to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : com@@ edy show , giving us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships &quot;
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more desperate as ever before , as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it is three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece of the battle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
&quot; in the age of communication conducted through social media , with its emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more profound . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent h@@ ug@@ s , moments while so@@ cks in cosy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can always refer to it , even if they often with@@ hold themselves completely to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of telephone care I explained to me : &quot; &quot; my audience role for people who feel de@@ pressed and suicide are clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I can cope with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; as much as my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may help people in the eye of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ ign Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria arrives at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria scored less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Shak@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only striving for the kno@@ ck@@ outs of the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ume in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals scored . &quot;
&quot; after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which was able to hold 2 : 2 un@@ deci@@ de@@ dly in his own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was st@@ ung by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ ass was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he went in to the long corner of the network in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a he@@ avier opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3rd minute , they offered little to attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up , with some short@@ com@@ ings and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half alone with no less than five attempts , after Cav@@ ani used him after the restart . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned the Di Maria into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
&quot; it ended all thought that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ land from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognised a goal at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league that did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fier games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore g@@ athers $ 2.5 billion through share sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , which is resident in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials , collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday as part of its huge debt cancellation plan . &quot;
&quot; the company , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion £ to pay its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn reduces demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid increase at the top of the London Stock Exchange when trading on Wednesday morning trading .
&quot; the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; last week , Gl@@ enc@@ ore announced the 2.5 billion dollars of stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to destroy around a third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on September 25th and re@@ jects President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yuan at a State D@@ iner after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks .
&quot; President xis visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese collaboration on a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi have the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit first was announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before he travels to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi addressed a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber es@@ pi@@ on@@ age in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion Champions , two times champion world champion , two times champion champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi is now announc@@ ing that he was before the Euro 2008 leave before the f@@ arewell from Barcelona . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not changing
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explained why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM .
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so he has taken me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , split the Red ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end of the royal class triumph . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the African filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not required behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ min@@ ed as this emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in filling the film and not in filling the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown responded , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers , to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I would like to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line , beaten by her white hal@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film , Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - that is SO BE that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
women &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s movement achieved nationwide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against the above @-@ mentioned content . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , it is uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; Crow@@ ns first Champion
&quot; Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition venue , which had just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot;
the climbing rope was part of the last task at a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task in time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge every three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. like I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final , and why Brit@@ ten , although he first received the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he got some res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac felt the same , if they had exchanged the roles . &quot;
&quot; America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday . &quot;
the T@@ wins got a chance to climb up to the second American League Wild@@ card slot for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to believe about a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in sixth and then again in ninth . &quot;
&quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside 6 times , and enabled three R@@ uns . &quot;
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ fights every game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first round since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the strike well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ do@@ cks , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get into play again . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right Fiel@@ ds Aaron H@@ icks got a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy ran over the wall , the only man he was faced with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run left @-@ run right @-@ handed in Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the finale run the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
&quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season , that pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth session , Detroit was able to set up a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ h@@ anders stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pitch for its fifth grade . &quot;
Detroit was the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game from an even un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three rounds in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than one month because of a back@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch da in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the lead off the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , created another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers put on the second one , made a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit very well , but he got the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three rounds at six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
note : tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to injury to the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ pull , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is deleted from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he was absent from 20 August because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in it will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden ex@@ po@@ unded on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily perish .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse after the government pres@@ idency of the governing pres@@ idency of G@@ ießen . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency lod@@ gings in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the determined thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; collective trails &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed by a military participation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the Austrian Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared that no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
Germany too did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call for concrete figures and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkans &quot; route . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week . &quot;
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU countries have so far failed to agree on common action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to a binding distribution of more than 120,000 refugees in a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ time and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , turn it too . &quot;
&quot; but those who have no perspective , could not stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view was unanim@@ ously dealt with in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , thousands of desperate refugees stuck in the Balkans . &quot;
&quot; in the night to Tuesday , Hungary closed its 175 km long border to Serbia . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to lock the border with Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia .
&quot; Hungary wants to avoid that tu@@ gs sought ev@@ asi@@ ve routes across Romania , Hungary Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut through the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , the number of e@@ ye@@ witnesses testi@@ fied that thousands more migrants were on the road to the Greek border . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; is the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot;
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ aps a global ocean .
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon turns easily on its way around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this exchange rate is only small , but still too big for a universal cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; even longer it was known , that it must be liquid water under the ec@@ lip@@ se of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot;
&quot; thus , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; was already discovered in 2006 Ice vul@@ can@@ e at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and iron particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers joined at that time . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to abst@@ ain from an offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; a study commissioned an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , informed the association . &quot;
R@@ ama was compl@@ aining about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s Lion , the diagnosis is expected to be four weeks &quot; forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; said sport director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , looking at the possible commitment of a united professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a Def@@ en@@ siv@@ mann . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; the Kro@@ ate currently has &quot; &quot; the possibility of demonstrating his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fighter Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training again next week .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to get into the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent cl@@ ash on his head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a severe bli@@ ster . &quot;
no Fruit @-@ Fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : in them vitamin B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. First of all , man@@ gan@@ ese contain plenty of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when purchasing , man@@ gan@@ ese should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
&quot; the shell @-@ color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is , so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or sweet food .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ ory dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , p@@ oultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. package service U@@ PS again provides up to 95@@ 0,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the company already started with recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
above all drivers are sought .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95@@ 000 subsidies . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions for the Christmas business since last year . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought a harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;

on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the fo@@ ehn partly blows through the flock of the flock .
&quot; after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind @-@ bu@@ cks and a temperature return . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive deep @-@ print area on the British Isl@@ es in a powerful southwest current . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , the valleys will break through the valleys at night . &quot;
&quot; in the wake of the F@@ öh@@ n to Thursday morning in the caves with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ i country partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ ehn can advance to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even Or@@ kan@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ ehn for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees provides , the moisture begins to st@@ ow at the slope . &quot;
&quot; here , rain puts on , that lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated , depending on the amount of rainf@@ all in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow we@@ aves the air , as a result rolls a cold front with a strong , partially swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes strong until stor@@ my , and temperatures go far behind . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of honorary President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday in the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the working community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the City of Pop@@ es were often only able to live in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city then as a comm@@ ended sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions should be reinforced by historians in his later fight against Rome .

Hammer artist invested in the personal interpretation of the Bible for three years
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thor@@ ns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now published with gorgeous images . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equal to &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he met a subjective @-@ artistic choice from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles have emerged that focus on topics such as cru@@ ising , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; with this he has spontan@@ eously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who wrote on the basis of painting with the respective scrip@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and so into today , translated into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror by Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original biblical certificate of Martin Luther , and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cl@@ asp has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ ham Order . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing has already been done with the cane , &quot; Oth@@ mar Alt &quot; re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up this , to bring me back to the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to re@@ vise art again in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is now characterised by advertising , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is displaced there .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall into the images &quot; to let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like living with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not take care to fully grasp the Bible , but have chosen the most important and mysterious subjects for him . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned to shape Erd@@ hü@@ gel for a round course : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn it was finished again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration caused dr@@ one , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; so hill shut down , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will take place in October , the First Commun@@ ist Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; commem@@ oration break &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees

the football re@@ acts to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing to me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; that must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday , and there I meet the Secretary of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and wants to help .
&quot; the decisive turn@@ outs , however , have to face politics . &quot;
the German So@@ ccer League therefore has extended its refugee initiatives &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; says Nier@@ sbach , on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot @-@ sleeves instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the printing &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ ens Sports Director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ sbach conf@@ essed the support of refugees as &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 Lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their locations , be great . &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we have spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have also called up the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; says Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP Board of Directors lo@@ oses an eye on accident
&quot; the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; after midnight on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he almost ble@@ eds , was power@@ less , and then brought out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner cited . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , however , could pursue his work . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 year old manager is attending the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to conduct the software group . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot;
it &apos;s important to get up again when you &apos;re fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Re@@ placement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered an appropriate picture and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; in Singapore on the weekend , he is as little as a spare driver for the two stam@@ mer@@ ing pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ quired , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken down . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top game against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B Coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
he announced a change at the goal of the goal .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of master b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future comes into action in all European league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ge statement of fellow players Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers medium field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l to be trac@@ eable : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to get the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany is to be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IA@@ A trade fair , from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which also come together with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and fast switching on digital radio . &quot;
&quot; for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks arise , &quot; the Federal Government wishes to check the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the per@@ missible top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 mph . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the federal government wants to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention which has so far only seen the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increases the leadership , the driver becomes more and more the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which record the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles are expected to be expected in public roads &quot; until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital alliance , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could imagine at least 15 percent , in the traffic 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth would not leave the car under any circumstances . &quot;
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current status , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf stri@@ ves for the title fight between September 25 and October 4 , only in the individual . &quot;
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , head of the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo &apos;s the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; said Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the setting list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; that is why we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; declared the world ranking fifth . &quot;
the British football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has with@@ drawn a heavy injury on the right leg .
&quot; at the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the Def@@ ender was hit by a tac@@ kling by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an ant terrible
&quot; it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figures &quot; &quot; Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett &quot; &quot; : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich . &quot;
&quot; the highlights : display man@@ nequ@@ ins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits became the great star of fashion scene - and that he was stuck in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today , I can no longer tell that I am the en@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his initially rej@@ ecting attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a little bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving work of man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not built up chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograp@@ hed overall art work , for which a lot of effort was used : to refresh the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot;
14 tons of material earned the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Festival there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative modi@@ fying experiments of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
to play with a doll his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught himself the design of fashion .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich . &quot;
later I bought it but of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but could keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener peak as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it worked on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the mo@@ dic@@ ate Pl@@ auen . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of Pl@@ au@@ ener peak fashion plays a larger role , it was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans back on past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already take half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mo@@ desp@@ itze Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies . &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
retail stores and wholesale markets are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively by chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the export , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons therefore for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein explains : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; a graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger outer corner of the West@@ Saxony University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , speci@@ alizing in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design will often only vary slightly to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historic snow ball . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sticks little ch@@ icks at some points . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ mare Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ght was inspired by this : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who would like to mem@@ or@@ ise . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends should not be stir@@ red , but Disney calls for a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about re @-@ in@@ filtr@@ ating but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays the magic children &apos;s girl for twenty years after the first film . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping spoke on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new spin @-@ off@@ s and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , Xi said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population detector system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a far @-@ right business environment and shaping the market open , the statement said . &quot;
the government will also make controls over the powers transmitted to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also attended the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury @-@ border value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous fish , and to allow consumers to significantly increase the dose of nerve gifts . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who has a corresponding work paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full impact on pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; commented Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish are to be lifted at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish for &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury that on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the length cannot be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 per cent would be un@@ market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; trick &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; that is why the lowering of frac@@ tures is &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ action manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal poison@@ ous for the human being which accum@@ ulates on the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; even small amounts of inf@@ ants may cause damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explained on its homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is mainly transported through coal combustion to the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants b@@ ade more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury last year , two @-@ thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish@@ ings , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and widespread , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had been cited in March out of paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from mer@@ cury in fish have already counted among the most frequently reported health risks in the RA@@ SF@@ F warning system . &quot;
