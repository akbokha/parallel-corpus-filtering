&quot; this data does not need to be materi@@ ally covered by the organisation , provided that it will remain accessible to the organization in the Community premises for further examination . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation brings the approval of the community and states to the appointment of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) S@@ aid the community either against a proposed denom@@ ination or at any point against a given designation , thus propos@@ ing one or more alternative denom@@ inations to the organization of the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the re@@ peti@@ tive refusal of the community to appro@@ ve the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is imp@@ eded by this Convention , the Council shall discuss the refusal to discuss with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
B ) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organisation may actually be able to fulfill them according to their agreements .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) are as low as possible for the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disturb@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities lying beneath ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other information provided by the inspec@@ tors of the organisation for knowledge of confidential information .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks according to the Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the Privileg@@ es and Liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures according to these conventions are termin@@ ated with respect to core material , when the community and the organization find that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity , which is no longer usable or practically cannot be re@@ usable . &quot;
&quot; according to this Convention , the community noti@@ fies the transfer of core material from the states under the scope of this Convention , which is subject to the security measures following this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures following this Convention are termin@@ ated with regard to core material as soon as the receiving state , as envis@@ aged in the Convention , has taken responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation conduc@@ ts documents from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures to the further core material . &quot;
&quot; the core material , which is subject to securing measures according to this Convention , shall be used in case of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , so that the association with the organization is agreed upon such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures according to this Convention can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the candle material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives during the duration of non @-@ use of the securing measures according to this Convention .
B ) The organisation and the community make a provision that the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will not be applied as long as the core material is used for such activity .
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be used . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is being returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is kept up to date on the total quantity and composition of this material in the country concerned or the states concerned and on any transfer of such material from this state or to these states .
&quot; this explains their agreement as swi@@ f@@ tly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as time and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a permit or under insi@@ der knowledge of military action , and does not apply to the ensu@@ ing use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grows in the implementation of their respective obligations under the Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , the States or those who are subject to their sovereignty , however exceptional costs arising from a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs as long as it has been trans@@ figured in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states ensure that the liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used according to their laws and other provisions , in the same way as to the nation@@ alities of the states . &quot;
any claim that the community or the state against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the state due to damage - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - is asser@@ ted in accordance with international law .
&quot; after examining the relevant information provided by the General Director , the Council shall not be able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to security measures according to this Convention , can restore the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and may also take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council takes into account in which mass is achieved by the securing measures applied , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is affected - any justi@@ fiable occasion to give the advice the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the organisation , the community or a state , consultations will take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , are examined by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes , a statement made by the Council in accordance with Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council shall be disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another by the Organization , the Community and the States , upon request of a party to submit an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states name two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also ren@@ ames two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appoint a fifth , which will pres@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organisation have not appointed two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for an arbitr@@ ator , the Community or Organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the arbitr@@ ators shall be competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the community of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply their security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states consult one another on request of any of the contracting parties about a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All amendments require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
&quot; a ) This agreement enters into force on the day , in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for the entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention remains in force as long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the Protocol .
the purpose of this section of the Convention is to determine the procedures required for implementing the provisions of Part I concerning securing measures as required .
the objective of the precau@@ tionary measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of distributing significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a distributing by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; for the enrich@@ ment of the target determined in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ ati@@ m with spatial integration and monitoring as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the tests performed by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of material for each material balance zone is specified for a certain period of time , stating the accuracy limit for specified me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organization after article 3 makes full use of the assurance system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the community will use the methods and measures of the following way and they , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are near@@ er determined and appropriate in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock of the core material and the volumes ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of the measurements and the assessment of the measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of transm@@ itters and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
e ) procedure for evaluating pil@@ es of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which shows the core material inventory and the changes of this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone , for each material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; ( g ) provisions , which ensure that the booking procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) procedures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
&quot; B ) Uran@@ ium or th@@ orium content which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle under the letter c ) is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not implemented for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) the core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity for the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the core fuel cycle , is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled or desirable , the organization and the community consult each other on the application of appropriate securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are am@@ ic@@ ably determined that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material if it is used in grams or smaller amounts than sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; ( C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community the organisation fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , from these securing measures , provided the total material quantity liber@@ ated in the States at no time amounts to more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; C ) 20 metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; should the free core material be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject , processed or stored according to this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the securing measures are taken on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets the organization of supplementary agreements , which is necessary in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective assistance of the tasks of the Organization in accordance with this Convention , in detail as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts in order for these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the take @-@ over between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report published in Article 62 , the organization provides a consolidated inventory of the total material material that is signed in Article 62 , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its veri@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme fixed at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general traffic @-@ cent@@ ers@@ problem problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by Member States will be tied within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and , as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other through the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria defined in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; Special Investment Account &quot; which consists of the funds entrusted to the Member States in accordance with this Agreement and is used ( in this capacity , the organization will be referred to as &quot; ste@@ wards &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is seg@@ reg@@ ated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is done in the form of cash or in@@ sensitive deb@@ tors of the member state , who , on demand in the currency of the State concerned , to pay the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited in the country &apos;s jurisdiction in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the application within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the manager at the time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker considering the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach member state may request payments in advance of the above mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker will take about propor@@ tion@@ ale drawings to cash or school fees to cover expenses for the special loans and balance the Special Investment Account in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; in the case of gran@@ ting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the E@@ EC conditions : &quot;
III ) the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional lending capacity to credit conditions ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each shareholder loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ end@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral scheme ) , regardless of whether it is part of the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices , which are considered to be the objective of the agreement named under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the Special Inter@@ action account shall not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound by the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Section 4 , special loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment terms , which are generally valid for the development loan granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in 10 years of age in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are rep@@ ay@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts required to pay this security watch are to be made directly to the organization that re@@ tains it .
&quot; each loan loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the source of the funds is specified in particular . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special loan loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are manufactured or provided . ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are , and those according to what the car@@ et@@ aker defined at the time of the loan guarantee , recipient of a special loan loan could be . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special loans are to be credited to the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in the currency of a member state is as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; the administrator has instruc@@ ted the E@@ EC to complete all special loans issued to the E@@ EC , through the plans and programmes approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the period of rep@@ ay@@ ment of the special loan loan , the administrator supervis@@ es the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special loans and the expenses for this loan . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible after the financial year of the organization , the administrator convey@@ s a detailed account of the transaction accounts with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account closure . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special loan loan , the E@@ EC car@@ et@@ aker sends a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the Special Investment Bank . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes suitable records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , resulting from the account recei@@ pts , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the withdraw@@ als to the member states are evident . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the Man@@ agers work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the complete issue of the Special Inter@@ action Account from time to time receive an exchange of ideas on the status of the Special Inter@@ action Account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by Special Inter@@ actions , and all other issues concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organisation possibly agreed , did not enter into force , so the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties concluded with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of the loan amount received by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all parties resulting from it are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedures concerned .
the Secretary @-@ General leads these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper appro@@ ving of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is translated into two original manus@@ cri@@ pts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding equal to equal terms . &quot;
whereas the agreement is signed in the form of a change to change Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE RE@@ LA@@ SS@@ ES :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation according to chapter V of the Eur@@ atom treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Business J@@ ET &quot; - will be transferred . &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been concerned with research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is carried out , it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping and to accelerate their respective research work , which has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement should put each contracting party into a position to avoid unnecessary over@@ l@@ apping through a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for the mutual research work , i.e. , by using the controlled core fusion reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of this agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes , defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and the forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or modified following examination by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , it enters the agenda of the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realized by : - adequate participation of each of the parties during preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third @-@ states , &quot; as well as the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right of access to the scientific and technical results of each program .
&quot; within the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; association agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the states and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the date of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Human Resources &apos; . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the time of entry into force of the present agreement to the Joint Business J@@ ET , which has accepted its statutes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland may become contractual partners of any contract whose purpose falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the bodies , which are tas@@ ked with carrying out the association provided in Article 2 , 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes setting up a steering committee , the competent representatives of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , and thus to direct the best results achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by no more than two delegates in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; V@@ G . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions related to ongoing or planned programs and activities in the field of the Eur@@ atom program , takes this task on all research and development activities to which this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and aims at promoting their T * ability in the interests of both parties involved in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme and in Articles 1 of the present agreement , with which the scientific and technological developments in the world will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities are concerned . &quot;
&quot; the advisory groups , which present the V@@ G research proposals to the extent that the means approved for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task in terms of all research and development work carried out in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the directors of one of the laboratories involved . &quot;
&quot; the committee &apos;s committee to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , fulfill this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of personnel and for the exchange of the same between laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to take part in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees established within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordin@@ ating committees , which provide adequate proposals for the best use of the resources , personnel and knowledge and skills of the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , carry out this task in the respective field with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a representative responsible for the core and energy research of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third state . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in the preparation of future programs and the establishment of their overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the area of merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the V@@ G , the Director Committee , the Advisory Group and the coordin@@ ating committees have an advisory character . &quot;
the opinion of the V@@ G to the urgent actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the committee &apos;s committee in the area of HR exchange .
the representatives of the two contract parties work in the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; according to this agreement , the Swiss financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom program is fixed annually to an amount , which is at the cost of the Eur@@ atom program in the same proportion to the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of the atom on the Common Market as soon as this is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland is transferring an amount to the Common Market J@@ ET , which is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Common business . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of the work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contribution to the financing of the work , which are carried out due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
the Commission divi@@ des the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with which amount to cover expenses in the framework of the Eur@@ atom program is envis@@ aged for the relevant year .
the Federal Council is paying the amount due to this Article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
July . the other payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are laid down in Anne@@ x III of the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures , so that Eur@@ atom is exemp@@ ted from tari@@ ffs or other donations as well as import ban and restrictions to the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland or where acquired items may not be declared free of charge in this country or free of charge , unless approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to resting wages and loans which will be paid to these persons .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Agreement shall be governed in Article 14 and 15 of this Agreement , in the Association Agreement and in the Agreement on the Exchange of Human Resources . &quot;
the provisions on access to the knowledge required for Switzerland &apos;s participation in the Joint Business J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this agreement and in the Stat@@ utes of the Common Market .
the right of any party to access the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
&quot; - the exchange of personnel among the involved laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ; &quot;

&quot; the agreements could be closed down to the total amount of the contribution paid by credi@@ tor countries to the mechanism paid by credi@@ tor countries , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future stand@@ by funds of the member countries . &quot;

&quot; in each stand@@ by credit , the BIS would first take on an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extending extensions without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as during the extended extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit default vision . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the first draws would not be made before the end of a month following the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draws would take place in the currencies available at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods taking into account the funds of the Bank , expected to be three or six months . &quot;
&quot; conditions would correspond to those who applied the BIS at the respective time at similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BIS has to obtain the necessary funds even on the market , the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum , corresponding to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin . &quot;

in the form of a letter change between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic about the trade of amm@@ unition and lamb
&quot; I honor to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on import@@ ing H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat from the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or ch@@ illed lamb , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in battle body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the amount of annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or refriger@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 in order to find a suitable solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community accepts the protective clause , it obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the common market is not affected . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceeded the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products recorded by this agreement to a maximum rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; with the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount specified under number 2 corresponding to the extent of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burden for these new Member States is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the calculation of deduc@@ tions mentioned under number 5 will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 23@@ ,000 tonnes of battle weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community is taking precau@@ tions in order that the sales of intervention states in frozen meat is not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat due to the implementation of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of funds or other funding measures for export@@ ing H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that quantities of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement are given for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community , in turn , obli@@ ges itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions in order for the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina on the basis of a export license issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be wai@@ ved for the goods in question .
&quot; furthermore , implementing regulations stipul@@ ates that the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals is given the amounts given to the export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand about trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor to take on the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on import@@ ing H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep &apos;s economy and export@@ ation of amm@@ unition - and lamb meat in the world market , and especially after the community for New Zealand &apos;s economy , must be ensured that the normal sales of New Zealand and lamb on these markets is not imp@@ aired , I honour myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement is valid for : - fresh or frozen H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will be secured for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the commun@@ ion market in the agreement stipul@@ ated in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal sales of his amm@@ el and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , New Zealand accepts to ensure that the amount of annual quantity does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ defined quantities are executed in conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community affir@@ ms that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the community market .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two contract parties consul@@ ate each other before introducing such a change in clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 in order to find a suitable solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protective clause , it obli@@ ges itself to protect the interests of New Zealand &apos;s interests resulting from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products recorded by this agreement to a maximum rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand will change the quantities set out in clause 2 according to the extent of New Zealand &apos;s trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import burden for these new Member States is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the clause 5 will be taken into account in clause 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned in clause 2 , with the day of the accession of Greece to the community , is set to 245 500 tons of battle weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could compromise the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets provisions in order to prevent the sales of inter@@ vention@@ ism from frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of this goal . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of meat in the community without danger for market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of funds or other support measures for export@@ ing H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is to be reconc@@ iled with existing international obligations and taking into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities stated in clause 2 in particular that there is no export lic@@ ences in excess of these amounts .
&quot; the community , in turn , obli@@ ges itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand depends on the submission of a export license issued by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license can be wai@@ ved for the goods in question .
&quot; in terms of implementing regulations , the competent New Zealand authority in the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals is given the amounts given to the export lic@@ ences ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot;

the annual volume stipul@@ ated in clause 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount pay@@ able from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is fixed in relation to the total @-@ year amount .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand , and for New Zealand &apos;s main area . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 in relation to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; an &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative advantage over C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the tigen D , the ser@@ um is supposed to react with blood cells , the do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , designed to use slides in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it respon@@ ds with floo@@ ding human red blood cells containing the tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these ser@@ a are therefore specific for the C @-@ tigen only if the blood cells tested have been weak@@ ened in a 0.9 percent sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; the Tit@@ ans of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , designed for use on slides in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more people immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 towards C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on slides in accordance with the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form Anti @-@ D may contain ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ e ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation time in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction should not be lower than with the ant@@ ec@@ oni@@ ous antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A ser@@ um is derived from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells , which contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is , those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ eal no human red blood cells that contain no A @-@ tigen which means those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding comparative advantage , separated with floo@@ ds of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the Joint Declaration adopted by the Ministers of the EF@@ TA Countries and Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , which includes a call for the creation of a European Economic Area , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fying the borders and the original rules of origin , &quot;
&quot; in the assessment that the community decided within the Action Programme to strengthen the internal market , as of 1 January 1988 in in@@ tra @-@ Community goods transport , to introduce a uniform management paper , &quot;
&quot; in the assessment that it is appropriate to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA Countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a single management paper , &quot;
&quot; in the assessment , that this Convention may not be interpreted in a timely manner , that it bin@@ ds the parties from its obligations from other international agreements - &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the transport liabilities between the Community and the EF@@ TA Countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as standard paper ) is introduced , which is to be used without prejudi@@ ce to the type and origin of the goods for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
the transactions associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single permit for pre @-@ prints to be used according to the patterns in App@@ endi@@ x I to the Convention .
&quot; the uniform paper is used as an application or paper for export , dispatch or import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; - to be explicitly required for the implementation of legal regulations in force in a contracting party , whose application is not guaranteed in the sole use of the uniform ; &quot;
&quot; - required by the parties , so that they may be able to obtain an advantage or a certain facil@@ itation upon request . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement prevents the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ le procedures may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the concerned goods are not present at a customs office and the application for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; moreover , the submission of an incomplete application can be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , a registration in which the relevant authorities shall be able to submit a peri@@ odi@@ cal application must be submitted within the period set by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted instead of using the same paper . &quot;

&quot; - allow applications to be created without im@@ print by public or private data processing facilities , according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities to request the data necessary for obtaining the relevant authorities in their data processing systems for the treatment of applications , if necessary without giving a written application ; &quot;
&quot; - allowing the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of applications , that the export , mail or import announcement depends on either the uniform paper produced by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering data into the data processing system ; &quot;

&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country or its representative in this country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In violation of paragraph 1 , the application shall always be carried out in one of the official languages of the import country if it is carried out in this country by using other than the copies of the application submitted by the Cust@@ oms Office . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may apply for each individual proceedings part of a goods traffic between the contracting parties , only in this one section , to obtain the required registration specimens , to which necessary copies may be included in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on con@@ sign@@ ments , the relevant authorities can stipul@@ ate that the for@@ warding charges for export and shipping procedures are transferred to one and the same pre @-@ print by means of the copies designated for these recei@@ v@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the relevant authorities will agree to the extent that the information contained in the copies of the application is contained in the individual proceedings . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure trouble @-@ free goods traffic between the contracting parties and to facilitate the exposure of irregular fluids or violations , the customs authorities of these countries place each other on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance can be denied or denied in whole or in part , if the requested country of view is that the administrative aid infr@@ ing@@ es its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests , or would viol@@ ate business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;

the contractual parties DI@@ ES@@ ES convention that has been elabor@@ ated under the au@@ spices of the Council for cooperation in the field of customs .
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to facilitate comp@@ iling , comparing and evaluating statistical data , particularly those of international trade , &quot;
&quot; in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH , to reduce the costs resulting in the fact that in international trade goods , goods have to be newly re@@ written , newly co@@ ded and re @-@ co@@ ded to facilitate the standardis@@ ation of the trading documents and the transmission of data , &quot;
&quot; in the assessment that the development of technology and structures of international trade necess@@ it@@ ates significant changes in the Brussels Treaty of 15 December 1950 , with the customs tari@@ ff scheme for the import of goods to customs tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore IN THE estimate , that the level of differentiation expressed by governments and the economy for tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is presently far beyond that which is contained in the system to the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in fact , that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in the assessment , that the Harmon@@ ised System is to be used for freight rates and traffic statistics of various types of transport , &quot;
&quot; in the assessment that the harmon@@ ised system is intended to be included as far as possible into the systems used in trade , for the designation and coding of the goods , &quot;
&quot; in the assessment that the harmon@@ ised system should contribute to achieving a close relationship between import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics , IN THE estimate that a close inter@@ relationship between the Harmon@@ ised System and the International Trade Register for Foreign Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations shall be safegu@@ ar@@ ded , &quot;
&quot; in the assessment that it is desirable to comply with the requirements listed above by a combined customs tari@@ ff and statistical reporting , which is appropri@@ ated for use by international trade partners , &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ised system to the development of technology and the structures of international trade ; &quot;
&quot; considering the work carried out by the Council for co @-@ operation in the field of customs clearance for the harmon@@ ised system in this field , &quot;
&quot; in fact , although the aforementioned agreement on customs tari@@ ff scheme has proven to be an effective tool to achieve some of these goals - the conclusion of a new international convention is the most suitable way to achieve the desired result - &quot;
&quot; in the sense of this agreement a ) &quot; harmon@@ ised system for the designation and coding of commodities , &quot; in the following &quot; harmon@@ ised system , &quot; consists of the positions and sub@@ positions with the associated code numbers , from the notes to the sections . chapters and sub@@ positions , as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ised system ; &quot;

amend@@ ment to the International Convention on Harmon@@ ised System for the Desig@@ ning and En@@ coding of Goods ( Events to Brussels on 24 June 1986 )
the contract parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a Council for the Cooperation in the Cust@@ oms Industry
&quot; it is desirable that , on 14 June 1983 , the International Convention on the Harmon@@ isation System for the designation and coding of the goods entered into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in fact , without a change in Article 13 of the Convention specified at the time of entry into force this Convention would remain uncertain - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ isation System for the designation and codi@@ fication of goods , referred to in Article 13 of the International Convention on 14 June 1983 , in the following &quot; Convention , &quot; section 1 receives the following version : &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement enters into force on 1 January , which follows immediately at the time after the exp@@ iry of at least sev@@ ent@@ een of states or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or have depos@@ ited their rati@@ fication or accession documents , but not before 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; A. This Protocol enters into force at the same time , if at least sev@@ ent@@ een of states or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists signed in Article 11 of the Convention on the adoption of the Protocol to cooperate in the field of customs clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only states or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists can deposit the certificate of the adoption of this Protocol , which have previously signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication , or at the same time sign or post@@ p@@ ate their documents on rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B. Je@@ der State and any customs or economic union , the contracting party of the Convention according to the entry into force of this protocol in accordance with paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version . &quot;
