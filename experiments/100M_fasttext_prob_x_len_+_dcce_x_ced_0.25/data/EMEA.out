&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Acc@@ ur@@ acy Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the conducted studies to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ th thought and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance , a mental disorder where patients may have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ mal sei@@ z@@ ure ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal temper@@ ament . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for preventing man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or the melt @-@ coated tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , which are also degra@@ ded like A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly used as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in less measure than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine plays a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their re @-@ occurrence . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms , was investigated in three studies up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , suffering from severe un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence , in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness with which Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and plac@@ ebo were compared over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment was examined . &quot;
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bed the sm@@ el@@ ting tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy dimin@@ ished in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented more effective than plac@@ ebo for recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally given to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were equally effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common adverse events of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled itting ) , irrit@@ ation , nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , irrit@@ ation , nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , irrit@@ ation , nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vom@@ iting , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturb@@ ance ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were talking about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance , if oral therapy is not suitable against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy to the entire European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of the meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disturb@@ ance in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic illnesses and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , vom@@ iting ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ on@@ ate for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if patients treated with abili@@ fy symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , consider reducing the dose or breaking the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics including abili@@ fy have to be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; there were however , in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dose , a significant relationship between dosing and response for unwanted de@@ cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in combination with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and leads to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is recommended if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased 107 % AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensively metabol@@ is@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made . &quot;
&quot; after conversion of the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose @-@ level before beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data security situation in humans and due to the concerns caused in the animal reproductive studies , this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side @-@ effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ par@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ sia , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was observed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term trial lasting more than 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
comparing the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and sei@@ zur@@ es , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma connection . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recep@@ tors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ c rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ and , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of the respon@@ dents involved in the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including the PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ al Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and at 57 % under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus plac@@ ebo , comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
also in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of Man@@ ia such as Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in part over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um @-@ mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ laying of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ism is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean period of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours with &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients did not show gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ Speci@@ fic Analysis of Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no evidence to clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans , thus only limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ ds @-@ aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( mean 10 times the medium Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a result of precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile according to repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ all of apes and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solv@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recep@@ tors .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of the meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets can use the mel@@ z@@ enges alternatively to abili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the appearance of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after onset or after changes of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;

dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recep@@ tors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness against plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio was between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
99 Bes@@ ides a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile according to repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ab@@ norm@@ alities and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance when oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be completed and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under the radius of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical state taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the medicine to abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy mel@@ z@@ enges or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ab@@ at@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which have been caused differently from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , vom@@ iting ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ on@@ ate for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythms ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and leads to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was larger compared to the following dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly received and simultaneously received the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the rate of res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensively metabol@@ is@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose @-@ reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after conversion of the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose @-@ level before beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after the sole activation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side @-@ effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently to ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral care of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term trial lasting more than 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
comparing the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and sei@@ zur@@ es , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant major improvements of Agi@@ itan@@ ism / behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ance was compared with plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ab@@ at@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the ab@@ at@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturb@@ ances compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; mean mean improvement from bas@@ eline value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour final score was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analysis of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe inflammatory , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population but a statistical significance could be detected due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of the respon@@ dents involved in the study were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including the PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sion@@ al Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disturb@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in part over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um @-@ mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular inj@@ ections 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after dose of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until the maximum plasma level was reached within 1 to 3 hours . &quot;
&quot; the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated inser@@ tion in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns regarding mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) were above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans ; thus , they only have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a result of the elimination of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile duct after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane spoke to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer have no difference in efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
&quot; in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments from their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it may also not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or having low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was in patients in which the first treatment was no more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy was and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union by Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited . &quot;
abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients whose first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
&quot; in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose has to be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were performed in patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on the safety and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nano @-@ particle formulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which could significantly have other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be taken and the patient must not be treated with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
patients should not be initiated again until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils have increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; during a clearly identified cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients following the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ative methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after treatment not a child . &quot;
male patients should be advised against the treatment of a sperm cell conservation because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect traffic and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects associated with the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy have occurred in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , blo@@ wers , tongue burn , dry mouth , pain in g@@ ums , loose stool , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of kid@@ neys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , head@@ aches , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , f@@ lange pains , dis@@ comfort in limbs , muscle weakness &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive outcome in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , there are no estimates of the actual incidence possible and there has been no caus@@ al relationship with these events . &quot;
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the amal@@ gam@@ ation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ sc@@ iss@@ ors and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ ation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the Trans@@ zy@@ to@@ sis of the plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in supports the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ dot@@ ion transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 Alb@@ ula receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ um@@ bi protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two @-@ armed un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III trial .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
&quot; this multic@@ entri@@ c study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which received a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in form of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ as@@ ation and 19 % due to metast@@ as@@ ation and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are outlined below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ies grade 3 at a time during the therapy . &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy as a result of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml equivalent to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration in a multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to an extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or soft band@@ age of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; the clearance of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration , and also the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is metabol@@ ised primarily to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given overall dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which refers to far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients aged over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in front of light light for more than 8 hours .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the market launch will provide healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
&quot; • training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( technical information ) , labelling and packing examples . • With a unique visual representation of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes for transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers , provided they have received adequate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
the iron levels of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment .
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used prior to surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and reduce the consequences of loss of blood .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been incorporated , which is enabled for the formation of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; when administered as an injection into a v@@ ein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with a main study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , with the reference drug . &quot;
&quot; at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ s@@ amed or to continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study investigating the effects of abor@@ tive targeting with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of patients who were converted to abor@@ amed were retained in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not cause allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the European Union &apos;s regulations , it has been demonstrated that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the Company , which provides Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical staff in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission approved Medi@@ ca Dru@@ gs P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG approval for the market launch of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ t my@@ el@@ oma , who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion occurs due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without a lack of iron , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion @-@ complications is expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 m@@ l. can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed in one patient over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is required in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ emia and the symptoms of an@@ emia . &quot;
these clinical results suggest that patients with initial low H@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; these clinical findings suggest that patients with initial low H@@ b ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; initial dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and total disease . therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a dose management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number for ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loid count &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ n count increased to ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ fs is required , should be received in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. several weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the Ab@@ aqu@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa was supposed to pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from an ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ li@@ lies ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently occ@@ uring heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the common causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ ela toxic@@ ation , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes ) , is degra@@ ding ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason of a drug loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be assessed and an examination of bone mar@@ row is considered to be considered a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not exceed under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have demonstrated no significant benefit due to the administration of ep@@ ox@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is elevated above the concentration required for control of the symptoms of an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not exceed under Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of kidney failure . &quot;
&quot; for tumour patients under chemotherapy , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should take into account a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients that need to be trans@@ figured ) . &quot;
&quot; if the increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; if possible , before the ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in case of an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that for patients with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cul@@ arly events may occur in patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , ep@@ ox@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned when a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels should be controlled by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro tests on tumour tissue , no evidence suggests an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF as regards hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; an@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( brain perf@@ usion , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients under ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations into thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sides and in terms of amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate part identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of an@@ emic patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ blast cells ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Hod@@ g@@ kin &apos;s lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ og@@ ho@@ blast cells ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 mam@@ mot@@ h carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal cell carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ mot@@ ac@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ ch@@ ial tum@@ ors , 174 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 other ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ og@@ ho@@ blast cells . &quot;
survival and progression was studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to several common mal@@ ign@@ om@@ ies consistent , significantly higher mort@@ ality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in combination with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in controls satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy , with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data . &quot;
ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the servo @-@ mirrors that are reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the mirrors remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the final gift . &quot;
bone Mark@@ fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be trac@@ ed back to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated for three years with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ sh@@ es was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal experimental studies with approximately the 20 @-@ times of the recommended daily dose , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased fat weight , to a del@@ aying the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports support in vitro diagnostic findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of minor significance to the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient use , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed unique for a maximum period of 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a sti@@ cky label , so if necessary , the measurement of sub@@ sets is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not exceed under Section 4.2 . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in blood pressure .

&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of the blood @-@ arm with Ab@@ sen@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of kidney failure . &quot;
a 2 - 3 week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .

&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances affect the tumour . &quot;

&quot; if your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken or used other medicines , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ sen@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means to build the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood @-@ arm ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may need regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread across two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor may need regular blood tests to check the success rate and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • O@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that br@@ ittle bones ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered from a minor traum@@ atic frac@@ ture like in case of stroke ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , A@@ cl@@ asta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; the first study included nearly 8 000 elderly women with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was investigated . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood reg@@ alized norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ tures in patients was reduced by 70 % compared to plac@@ ebo ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without o@@ steopor@@ osis medicine ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ ergy effects occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent when inf@@ usions are repeated .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ asta &apos;s manufacturer provides supplements for doctors to prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ era should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
&quot; after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure adequate intake of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ era inf@@ usion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
&quot; patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended because limited clinical experience for this patient group is available . &quot;
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta &apos;s children and adolescents are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data on un@@ obj@@ ection@@ ability and effectiveness are missing . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ave is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia should be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with A@@ cl@@ ave ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding to twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be assessed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk evaluation .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days of the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the incidence of severe side @-@ effect reported cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ asta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0,@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.9 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug interactions are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which referred to as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases referred to as acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were in a clinical study of o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years similar to the A@@ cl@@ ast and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of dose was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ era compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of the laboratory findings the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently released hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions at the inf@@ usion site , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area occasionally became , especially in cancer patients , about o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ opathic itis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area of one with A@@ cl@@ asta and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density filter or a BM@@ D T score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing spinal structure . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric teb@@ ral form@@ ulas A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new fluid chro@@ mat@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ergy treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of vascular complications compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ave increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , all hips by 6.0 % , of th@@ ist@@ le neck by 5.1 % and dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) one year after the third annual dose bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the basin .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to plac@@ ebo to increase the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the maintenance of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture .
bone turnover mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) - the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times .
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment resulted in an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % in the fem@@ oral neck . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % at plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once yearly administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the once weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate referred to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment in the case of Parkinson &apos;s disease of the bone A@@ cl@@ asta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly mild to moder@@ ately heavy mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um @-@ levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold to triple @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in combination with the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value of A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate . &quot;
patients who were classified as resp@@ onder@@ s at the end of the six month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study of 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , compared with 71 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , could be sustained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ eless . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma reaches up to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value of 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.0 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal eli@@ oration period t ½ h 146 hours . &quot;
the early dividing phases ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the inf@@ usion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid concentration at 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabol@@ ite in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an even kidney function disturb@@ ance down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .
&quot; because there are only limited data for severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was at mice 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight . &quot;
&quot; in studies in dogs , individual doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C mean 6 times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was determined in rats by doses of 0,@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C , corresponds ) , well tolerated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in accumulated positions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred with other organs , including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common occurrence in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absorb@@ able effect of the substance . &quot;
rats were observed in rats from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg following the low Ser@@ um calcium level . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance @-@ class substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is done too fast , and new bone material is constructed dis@@ ordered , making the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ave works by norm@@ alising the bone structure , ensuring normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff when using other medicines , if you use / use other medicines , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines , of which it is known that they harm the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying A@@ cl@@ ave together with food and drink , please worry that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; as A@@ cl@@ ave works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
&quot; before the end of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta If you are considering the completion of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the inf@@ usions afterwards . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; at present , it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ era causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; physical symptoms due to low cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

&quot; if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture is recommended to carry the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ era two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after A@@ cl@@ era administration , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a diet and exercise , A@@ comp@@ lia is used to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • those who are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more &quot;
four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking .
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was hard to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The full list of side effects reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia is to remove the treatment bite . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts among other things . &quot;
&quot; caution is required in simultaneous use of as@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

&quot; in Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average decrease in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des of 6.@@ 9 % was seen ( initial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type @-@ 2- diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 to plac@@ ebo after 6 months -@@ 0.8 % . &quot;
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 mg and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . LN &quot;
&quot; improvement of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % caused by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z &quot;

&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of these undes@@ irable effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , which were not observed in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic sector , were evaluated as possibly relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be linked to proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , thus no adverse effects were observed on the fertility or cycle disturb@@ ances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in doses up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study of rats to pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by Lak@@ tation caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Acc@@ ur@@ acy Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the conducted studies to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest acceptable dosage . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fa resin or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fa resin or insulin can be maintained with the start of the acet@@ yl@@ phen@@ ol ( low blood sugar ) , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fa resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa @-@ har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received either acet@@ one or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood glucose levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of additional acet@@ ylene was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ one and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin increased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with ac@@ tos were visual disturb@@ ances , respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that acet@@ one should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve the launch of Ac@@ tos in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ ular disease was performed .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased incidence of hep@@ atic enz@@ ym@@ atic ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range , the liver Enzy@@ mes are to be controlled as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , super@@ structure , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver Enzy@@ mes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessments .
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be obtained from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ channel or triple combination therapy with insulin , risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ens , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported about a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 tril@@ lion per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medicine .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to pregnancy or if this occurs , treatment is cancelled ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not exercise any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the insulin resistance resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not available from the present data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ or and the crus@@ hing of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents above triple the upper limit of the standard range , however , were often less than plac@@ ebo , but less commonly than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fa @-@ har@@ n@@ â . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ ular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ ides . &quot;
&quot; since its launch , it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials performed over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial lasting over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years to evaluate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of the therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimi@@ zing phase with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who still only received insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year there was a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the bas@@ eline values .
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks study of type 2 diab@@ etics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically , elevated L@@ DL cholesterol level has been observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de reduced the overall plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while lower values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both in terms of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is rapidly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to efficacy is equivalent to the triple the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , it has been demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; following the oral application of radio@@ active pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the average plasma @-@ Eli@@ mination rate of un@@ changeable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites is between 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreased , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder are induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ es resulted in increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 tril@@ lion per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medicine .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medicine . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were investigated .
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , there was a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both in terms of Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study l@@ acked the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the markings &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures of random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures was observed in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post @-@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both in terms of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; in some patients with long @-@ term type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and heart disease or previous stroke , which were treated with acet@@ one and insulin , heart failure developed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , in which pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was compared with other oral hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or plac@@ ebo ( active @-@ free tablets ) , women ( but not in men ) who took pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one showed a higher number of frac@@ tures . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as compared to another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane should not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ one may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to remove the package insert ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ anes were out@@ weigh the risks associated with the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the launch of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane in the whole European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial action together with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be changed and should accordingly be advised . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ polar , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA from insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane is required in the patient &apos;s dose adjustment , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic reactions occurred after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to consult his doctor &apos;s advice , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider potential interactions in the treatment and his patients always ask for other medicines taken by them .

&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of the medication lasts up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is due to the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a number of cle@@ av@@ age ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule have been considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the cle@@ av@@ age is active .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ yl may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit to transport Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin that is quickly working needs to be raised , then the amount of insulin that is working . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosing or in the first weeks or months after the switch . &quot;
&quot; travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to consult his doctor &apos;s advice , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of the activity amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data are limited , but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or arthritis ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ ate cryst@@ alli@@ zation , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism can still occur . therefore , it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ auer are still taking other medicines to prevent rheum@@ atism . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ o@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ auer ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients who took a dose of 80 mg daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who took 120 mg daily in the last three measurements of the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to that , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Aden@@ uria ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin r@@ ash and abnormal liver enzymes . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with cardiac complaints in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain adverse events affecting the heart and the blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of adverse events related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already lead to ur@@ inary drainage ( including one from the medical history known or currently available tops and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um resin has still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully studied ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents Since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ t recipient Because there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ emic heart disease or cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency the treatment is not recommended with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other non @-@ sow@@ ing medicines , it can cause acute arthritis during the initial treatment because it is possible to mobil@@ ise ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ seed pi@@ eg@@ els . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of Feb@@ u@@ o@@ stat@@ or and in further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in fiz@@ z did not perform any in@@ verter @-@ studies at Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; at test persons , the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ u@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ chic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without any dose adjustment needed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient at the same time .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC showed 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ or effect of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous capture of an ant@@ acids , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the recording of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be close to any side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not include direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the exam@@ iner was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ ine group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation was found with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ clerosis and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients received up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received the Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies for these doses or at a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , con@@ spic@@ uous E@@ KG , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin les@@ ions , erectile dysfunction , erectile dysfunction , erectile dysfunction , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
the effect of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ites in humans and is created within the scope of the reaction sc@@ as@@ k@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is a powerful , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro inhibit@@ ing that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients where the last three months certain ser@@ um resin @-@ acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment value at study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a significant significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a significant significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) received , were summ@@ arized for analyses . * p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 vs 80 mg &quot;
lowering the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ave pi@@ eg@@ els to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentrations in patients regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT ) had a ser@@ um acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 extension study showed that the permanent decrease in ser@@ um resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a dose ) .
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the ven@@ ous no@@ des size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the arthritis no@@ des up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dose propor@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; for doses ranging from 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to 2,8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in the concentration of ser@@ um acid concentrations , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 litres after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma separation of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is approximately 99.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 and that Feb@@ u@@ o@@ stat@@ eh@@ ard@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , about 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as un@@ modified Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , as@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at took about 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction did not significantly change the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes regarding AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( intermediate cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the highly @-@ dose treated group , at about the 11 @-@ times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and ur@@ inary composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in case of high doses , which were about 4.3 times of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a decrease in the increase in re@@ plen@@ ishment and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies with extrac@@ ting rats with ex@@ positions , which ex@@ positions approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and with load @-@ bearing rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which roughly doubled the 13 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;
Col@@ chic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ chic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without any dose adjustment needed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient at the same time .
diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease where bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 may already be used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D mirror .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data that present the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose , contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ob@@ struction ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ tuous abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) , as well as aci@@ dic sensation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any other component , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in diseases of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients unable to stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to transport AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • The patient should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , since there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , be given only with special care ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hospit@@ alization ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore carefully examine all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be pointed out when symptoms es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn use the medicine ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine correctly , and / or take it after the appearance of symptoms that point to mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , there were rarely ( after market ) gast@@ ric and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ opathic itis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment regime mainly contains intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the elimination of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a max@@ illary surgical intervention , reduces the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is author@@ itative for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk evaluation .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that at the failure of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE they should take the tablet the next morning after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take one tablet a week as originally planned for the planned weekday . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the therapy begins .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients , but also reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ ums increased to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0,65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , and side @-@ effects in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main action of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ amine D3 is the increase of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , the ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in o@@ steopor@@ otic patients . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( Ser@@ um value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ amine D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .

&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the share of patients suffering one or more ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ rate of 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Reference to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for no@@ d@@ ules between 5 and 70 mg after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting and two hours before receiving a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first eating or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the average of 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution trials to rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly circul@@ ates into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the com@@ partments .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic clear@@ ances did not transfer 200 ml / min . &quot;
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems .

&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion in the dose of radio@@ active marked vitamin D3 to healthy subjects was the mean secre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours , 2.4 % , in the com@@ partments after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the percentage of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in the animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a somewhat elevated accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is expected in bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent transplan@@ ting of transplan@@ ted organs from the immune system .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft , as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was exp@@ ended after one year of treatment ( for example , examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body . &quot;
&quot; trem@@ ors ( trem@@ ors ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar level ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , as well as in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be used . &quot;
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( in particular some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f since the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased incidence of adverse events , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; re@@ aliz@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dosage should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level measurements ( see below ) .
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations for both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation below Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate re @-@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral consumption of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment may be intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the preparation of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments can later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabil@@ isation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis for gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted a gra@@ ft receptor twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , thus taking place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ t following a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the oral initi@@ als recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
&quot; heart transplan@@ t In case of adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft recei@@ vers , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patients , came into an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced hep@@ atic function To maintain blood levels in the desired area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disturb@@ ances .
&quot; since kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , patients with reduced kidney function can assume that dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um incre@@ ment levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is recommended ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley mirror in the blood blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ king Contro@@ ls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dose adjustment , alter@@ ations of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may take several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of seb@@ um cannot exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the pH levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood stem in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has caused serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over @-@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; re@@ aliz@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close supervision of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recei@@ vers in childhood there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
&quot; due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is recommended , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to significant fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , ocular hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which may also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , sp@@ as@@ ms and visual disturb@@ ances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ absorption , special care is required in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase or decrease the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while using substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for the maintenance of even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole , and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies revealed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal contamination . &quot;
&quot; highly @-@ dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lowers the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives , and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive actions are particularly careful . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long its half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for potential harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyp@@ er @-@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence of 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

&quot; cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; action Mechan@@ ism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are likely to be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucleus . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent hibition of signal trans@@ duction in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells depending on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tors . &quot;

&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the major studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;

&quot; a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;

in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) than the number of patients that were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;

&quot; adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a disorder caused by the deficiency of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ots ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but manufactured according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been incorporated , which it enables the formation of human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , Adv@@ ate &apos;s effectiveness in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in 86 % of 510 new bleeding episodes was &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for the transport of Adv@@ ate throughout the European Union . &quot;
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency according to the location and extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , the recommended determination of factor VIII @-@ plasma can be advised for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ time periods . &quot;
&quot; 3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis To long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , doses should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma @-@ activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the feeding speed should be directed according to the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII . Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the magnitude of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in case of pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 re@@ positioning days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic well @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences on the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , which have a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .

&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) , an F@@ VIII @-@ inhibit@@ or was determined by exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
previously un@@ treated patients in a ongoing clinical trial constituted 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against Factor VIII .
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by investigating antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a continued peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were isolated from the occurrence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , pren@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ us gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product texts within the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , has decided to apply for another extension procedure within 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited granted the official approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that link and support other structures in the body are envel@@ op@@ ed and supported ) . &quot;
it is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically engineered so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; that has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced by the non @-@ broken p@@ 53 gene , which is not broken in the human body , normally contributes to restoring damaged DNA and killing cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the submitted documentation , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company on day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the inj@@ ections of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore bring benefits to the patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration , and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not notify the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
the release of active ingredients means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by allergies to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents ages 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is twice a day , which is to be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are abbrevi@@ ated . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main activity measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients showed their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of all h@@ ay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported to intake the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , over a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took up pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disturb@@ ance and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , or even hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the EC Europe approval a permit to transport Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without fr@@ ying it , to cr@@ ush or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of data , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms do not sound .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as for long @-@ term use the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy when necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , resp@@ . within the 2 weeks after the end of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , erg@@ y@@ amin , erg@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce the appropriate recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce the appropriate recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythms , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a gain of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; treating patients with heart rhythms • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be completed at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise have positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients with the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ convenience of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ ting properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering . &quot;

&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( m@@ outh@@ wash , pup@@ illary ar@@ re and - dil@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an adult single dose study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flow velocity , including ampli@@ fication of subjective conclusions or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily did not detect increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause other sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined based on the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling of the nose , determined on the basis of nas@@ al con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city defined patient sub @-@ groups . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze for healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole activation of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ produc@@ tion@@ toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not recognize any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies on seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by modi@@ fying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ gles , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were considered , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom sever@@ s was assessed after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the deployment of A@@ eri@@ us in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the disease progression and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms occur .
in the pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period a prolonged treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most commonly reported adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth drying ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ ache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ a as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flow velocity , including ampli@@ fication of subjective conclusions or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the score of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the load caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology similar to the ae@@ ti@@ ology of different forms is similar and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the history of hi@@ stam@@ ine is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , besides the chronic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , also leads to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies lasting 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pron@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and awareness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .

Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative difference in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin have no particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of an infectious hin@@ itis using A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to exclusion from upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age are limited to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and learn a higher amount of substance ( see under Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully met@@ aboli@@ zing , is identical to those in children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ cro@@ se @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the effect of alcohol is not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents diagnosed with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged 1 to 11 , who were eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily disaster dose of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults to the children &apos;s population can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
controlled clinical trials were noted in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in case of a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us pills in adults and adolescents in clinical studies have no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the intake of alcohol was neither a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced power imp@@ aired nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish those induced by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies lasting 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pron@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in ch@@ ew@@ ing paras@@ ites ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which restri@@ cts met@@ aboli@@ zing . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies revealed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) were applied .
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg a day ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily did not detect increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;

&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown on the score of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the load caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population were comparable , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;

there is limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dosage of the hot plate is taken without damaging them . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of sm@@ el@@ ting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side @-@ effects between the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us mel@@ z@@ enges proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ a for the intake formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;

&quot; in an adult single dose study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement variables of the flow velocity , including ampli@@ fication of subjective conclusions or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poor@@ ly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
in single @-@ dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us sm@@ el@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ a for taking the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully met@@ aboli@@ zing , is identical to those in children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months were the most commonly reported adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , there were no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see under section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
controlled clinical trials were noted in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be observed depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life for Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the load caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;

&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
different single dose studies revealed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution to intake is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , elderly people included . &quot;
&quot; if the solution for inser@@ tion an application sy@@ ringe is attached to the intake with sc@@ aling , you can use it as an alternative to take the appropriate amount of solution to take . &quot;
&quot; regarding the duration of treatment , your doctor will determine the type of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis that you suffer and will determine how long you take A@@ eri@@ us solution to take . &quot;
&quot; however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness frequent side effects while in adults ti@@ red@@ ness , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness and head@@ aches were often reported than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; 97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is available in bottles with a child @-@ safe closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
the 150 ml packaging size is a measuring spoon or application sy@@ ringe for intake with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml@@ - and 5 ml cans .
&quot; June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially handed over the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company re@@ jects its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain of H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus causing a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the flu virus appears that can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have not yet established immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; physically foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to make contact with a flu virus of this stem for faster antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a foreign body ) was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base did not suff@@ ice to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti @-@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules are available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; as@@ er@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drug the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines should be taken . &quot;
&quot; for children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ eri@@ ase is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti @-@ viral drugs , A@@ generated ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not to cure , but can delay the immune system &apos;s damage and therefore also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the high @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ generic was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 206 adults who used to be prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load following treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load among more than 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ generic ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; children also reduced the viral load among children , but only very few of the children who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were only very few . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , this compared with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the virus last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ vo@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger tr@@ ash of the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gen may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ ger@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just like A@@ ger@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ generic drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; as@@ er@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ generic in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; it was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted approval to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited as a permit for the transfer of greenhouse gases throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ generic drugs should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre @-@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule , therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ war@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic drugs are used without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be used . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ war@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ er@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not been studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data about safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ generic drugs should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction , and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ ger@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a decreased therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ cri@@ st@@ asis does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal disease progression .
&quot; for the event of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with previously controlled hep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction caused by anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ or@@ tic oids that are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible use of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the release of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of am@@ v@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
patients who are taking these medicines at the same time may be less effective for am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r plasma gas ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for os@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col in the A@@ gen ase solution to intake , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; as@@ er@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an indication of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which medications were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B . higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as a longer permanent anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages are reported . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections which leads to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width aspir@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in trying to compens@@ ate the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um Mir@@ ror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rin level and , if possible , to check the virus &apos;s load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % , on the other hand , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove efficacy and safety of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % decreases if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended close monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed in combination with Di@@ dan@@ o in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ generic are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in lowers the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r possibly .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advised , because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapy plasma . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be conducted , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous activation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side @-@ effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ generative , the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ er@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed but could be increased the plasma &apos;s of both drugs in case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma at 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines listed below including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if used together with A@@ generic , may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines when used in combination with A@@ gen .
&quot; based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da may not be taken at the same time as A@@ generic as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption problems . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ va , known as enzyme degra@@ d@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma beam of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ ger@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration significantly and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to test persons , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of A@@ generic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ oids , unless the possible use of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabol@@ isation is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , there are pronounced increases in plasma concentrations in simultaneous dosing of a@@ generative gases . &quot;
&quot; as plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ub@@ om@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; more frequent surveillance of therapeutic concentrations can be increased up to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased while am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gen may not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while with simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for os@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous treatment of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous treatment of a@@ generative ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected ; however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the ni@@ st@@ ung into the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the follow @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gen therapy were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment ab@@ rup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the sei@@ z@@ ure or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) assessed by the investig@@ ators as related to the study drug were performed and reported in more than 1 % of patients , as well as during the treatment of any kind of laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and anal connec@@ tive tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation ( bul@@ bs ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , not pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bul@@ ls ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 7 cases ( 3 % ) were observed in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s ( 3 % ) in 241 patients with In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro@@ por@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be broken off . &quot;
&quot; cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients , which received 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the types and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed very frequently in patients who received A@@ bread@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently permitted Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically were tested . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance samples that were similar to those observed in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were observed : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 54@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M as well as a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always approach the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for ass@@ essing the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; companies that exp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( Separ@@ ation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity towards in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment not previously untreated patients with which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of which showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the maintenance of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the test@@ ament of the efficacy of A@@ ger@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which patients treated with PI ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards A@@ rom@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ flow threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ born A@@ war@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gen .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; A@@ generic .
&quot; according to oral dosing , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % , on the other hand , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake affected the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , representing the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentrations of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remain constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates throughout the dosage interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , which indu@@ ce CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with A@@ generic ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exhibition like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; from the solution , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules . therefore , A@@ generic ase and A@@ generic capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of kidney function disturb@@ ance on the elimination of am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot;
these regim@@ ens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma membrane comparable to those obtained on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma was not elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; in the present study data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there is little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation test in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in the clinical routine by measuring the AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the ad@@ minist@@ ering phase or after the end of treatment . &quot;
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated from an age of 4 days demonstrated high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with the pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic drugs are used without the rein@@ forcing addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be used . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ war@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with weak or mild liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; as@@ er@@ ase should be dischar@@ ged to 27 if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer permanent anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % , on the other hand , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended close monitoring because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be conducted , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with a@@ generative , the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will fall to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although there are no clinical data available for this . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine ,
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to test persons , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous treatment of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % res@@ p .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the ni@@ st@@ ung into the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding time Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in weight during the down@@ time . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is indic@@ ative of signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) when necessary , provide necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the maintenance of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , therapy optimisation should be considered with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; A@@ generic . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentrations of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remain constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates throughout the dosage interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , which indu@@ ce CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with A@@ generic ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney function disturb@@ ance on the elimination of am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be minor .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , ben@@ ign aden@@ omas ben@@ ign in male animals that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma was not elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , there is little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;

studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated from an age of 4 days demonstrated high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with the pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in young animals the metabolic path@@ ways are not fully mat@@ ured , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ generic ase solution for recording was not proven neither with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule , therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ war@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ generic term solution for inhal@@ ing and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary for necessary , an application of A@@ generic ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic response as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col content , A@@ generic ase is a solution to intake in inf@@ ants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ cri@@ st@@ asis does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines which can cause serious or life threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; if a skin r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer permanent anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages are reported . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % , on the other hand , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ generic can increase their plasma concentration significantly , and associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturb@@ ances , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increased the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am following the oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is unknown . A@@ generic ase solution for intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected ; however , it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given to the uter@@ us in the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding time , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during the follow @-@ up . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the sei@@ z@@ ure or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently permitted Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .

&quot; • In case of acute war@@ ts in the genital area , Al@@ dar@@ a is to be applied three times a week up to a maximum of 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected areas of the skin , so that they remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before being washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all trials , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo had been administered either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ os .
&quot; • In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In treating war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate was between 15 % and 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible genital war@@ ts in the genital or per@@ anal area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
a break in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammation reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; in case of follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only in@@ completely healed , another therapy should be initiated ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient would need to apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual regim@@ en . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and cleaned in the cleaned , with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces infected skin area until the cream is completely dra@@ ined . &quot;

&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed even under proper use , which have necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied means for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ic@@ um area , no clinical experiences have yet been found . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ination reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group regarding the removal of the genital war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair attachment has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during the therapy or the reactions turn back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment period can be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data available about long term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs do not present clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended in case of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower likel@@ ihood of response to im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
only very limited data is available about the use of im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the treatment of intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause serious dis@@ comfort to the patient , or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions indicate a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;

the most commonly shared and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in studies with three weeks of weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of genital war@@ ts ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects .
the most common than likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction at the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the investig@@ ative evaluation of the clinical signs , these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials often led to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , exc@@ itation / dump@@ ing ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , the clinical signs show that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and a severe sensation ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dental unique oral absorption of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 sach@@ ets , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 screening relevant phase 3 efficacy studies showed that the efficacy in regards to a complete healing of the genital war@@ ts in an im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
&quot; at 60 % of the total 119 performed with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients , the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) &quot;
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients versus 5 % of 161 treated with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI )
&quot; efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured , and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of weekly treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;

the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical wound healing .
&quot; the approved indications of external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively .
a minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three week application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and measured 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single @-@ bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on the current toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg body resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen @-@ weight ; a study carried out for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice in older administration on three days a week induced no tum@@ ors to the application .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and does not mut@@ ant , there is a risk for people due to systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
tum@@ ors entered the group of mice treated with the drug @-@ free cream earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

&quot; very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every new information that may be disclosed , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will see patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in terms of the reactions to the inf@@ usion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. permission to transport Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient dies , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be performed in an appropriate clinical setting , which will immediately be available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because there is little experience in resum@@ ing treatment after a longer break , risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction must be cau@@ ti@@ ously prec@@ eded after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be assessed and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to half of inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 become ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on breast milk , is recommended to do not satisfy al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me during treatment . &quot;
the adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase III study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment period of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe follow @-@ up form and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dosage ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
in most patients there was a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment .
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( resp@@ . to a premature departure from the study ) , there were no antibodies known by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ y@@ c@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients with whom it had never come to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with l@@ acked down to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was observed in the urine . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutral inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the appearance of undes@@ irable drug reactions was typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulate sub@@ strate and preventing further accumulation of adequate recovery of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose 6 Phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the serious phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the FE@@ V to be expected and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute ear test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function versus plac@@ ebo group , which is shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ alo@@ virus ( 85 % ) , a normal liver size was observed until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first four weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous diseases of the patients , which was taken into account by the use of a combined repository , the clin@@ ically significant changes in line for five effectiveness variables were observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me &apos;s safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy stroke form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased g@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe follow @-@ up form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was detected . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schemes on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute @-@ test were performed . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dosage ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique dose , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; since no compatibility studies were carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except with the ones listed under 6.@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that the di@@ lution is controlled under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the holder of the authorization for the transport market has the following programme of studies to conclude , which results provide the basis for the annual review report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
this register will receive long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; patients suffering from M@@ PS I have an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase has occurred with you .
inf@@ usion @-@ conditioned reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines taken or taken before , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;
indications for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for manufacturing an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient dies , will gradually increase every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; very common ( appearance in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nau@@ sea • stomach ache • skin r@@ ash • joint pain , pain in arms and legs • red@@ dened pulse • hyper@@ tension • Less oxygen in the blood • Response to the inf@@ usion site &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available , rate , and if necessary , the package insert will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided that the di@@ lution is controlled under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • first determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ent blood vessels according to body weight of each patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drug against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is probably easily spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( pharmaceuticals against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood cells change or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , ab@@ ated or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells being divided .
&quot; the transformation of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed into its active form is more easily done in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 month compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the single dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who previously received chemotherapy had the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack squ@@ am@@ ous cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta indicated longer survival times than with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission informed the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. permission to transport A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the s@@ wine bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
&quot; in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin , ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ op@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma , except for over@@ weight plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after conclusion of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma after prior chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed @-@ Gabe . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue during the entire therapy period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third duration of the treatment .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixes , a complete blood image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place whilst taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the pre@@ - h@@ ending treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
if patients do not develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA needs to be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA needs to be ab@@ orted when in patients with 2 dose reduc@@ t@@ ans a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort in grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , there is an elevated side effect risk in patients aged 65 years . &quot;
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and effectiveness .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary for dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin level and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( if liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically investigated in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored in terms of bone @-@ market suppression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ron numbers once again reached a value of ≥ 600 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number once again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ emic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia has been be@@ amed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
therefore all patients with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treated patients must be used to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous capture of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and less than 2 days after the therapy with emet@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is provided , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ weight for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with emet@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients experiencing these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent should be considered before the p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this ingredient was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic ingredient . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except Yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity through P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised in front of the patient &apos;s patient to consult consultation with regard to sperm conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can result in increased re@@ occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution must be advised if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ izing 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ weight such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days prior to therapy must be avoided at least 2 days after the therapy with emet@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with decent An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary , demanding and after careful consideration of the use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity through P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the start of treatment to consult consultation with regard to the sperm count . &quot;

&quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important fol@@ lic acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies , P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ ogenic ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ides . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the common c@@ is@@ pl@@ a- tine arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement in lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in control .
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ised , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC received a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival effects on overall survival fell to favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly not dis@@ kl@@ epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9,@@ 3 versus 7.4 months , adapted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ prem@@ acy of the ALI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 5.2 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin compared to 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see the table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ prem@@ acy , with a total margin ratio for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ sig@@ net limit of 1,17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ mer@@ gers ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ mer@@ gers ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;

&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , as a mon@@ otherap@@ eutical , were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with a variety of solid tum@@ ours ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usi@@ ons over a period of 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; emet@@ re@@ mixed will mainly be ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the dose administered will remain in the urine within 24 hours of application . &quot;
emet@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al fun@@ tion ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of fats eaten with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared with plac@@ ebo in 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg taken an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year versus 2.3 kg taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for the patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ work , chair strand , o@@ ily / o@@ ily fa@@ eces , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be applied in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission approved G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve the distribution of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ otic and fatty diet .
&quot; it may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , because there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , the dosage is not necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a high @-@ fat single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of anti@@ diab@@ etic medication may need to be adjusted . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional precau@@ tionary measures , in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with the simultaneous use of Or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma has been observed . &quot;
&quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene were normal . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; following the dose of a dispos@@ able dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers were observed at the same time , a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies did not show direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of known side @-@ effects identified after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of certain size . &quot;
it is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in regards to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and over@@ weight patients over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at have been reported . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid atro@@ phy of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ pas@@ ab@@ ating properties can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is composed in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ ine remaining of the ga@@ stro and pancre@@ atic lip@@ ases .
&quot; clinical trials were derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ otic , fatty diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3,30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; during waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours following the oral dose of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be spor@@ adic and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minim@@ ally absorb@@ able dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ form @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified which represented nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data does not recognize any particular danger to humans . &quot;

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • Blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • Lyme disease • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis Review with your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what amount is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body can &apos;t handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time decrease the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously grow about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set yourself realistic calories and fat destinations and also adhere to them . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat reduction and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , you can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; it is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ is can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
&quot; this means that the drug inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ is was studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or even tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are regular tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for placing Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ is is indicated : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in case of strongly em@@ itted chemotherapy , due to a canc@@ er@@ ous disease and for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ itted chemotherapy , due to a canc@@ er@@ ous disease . &quot;
the effectiveness of al@@ op@@ an@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting caused by a strongly em@@ itted chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute im@@ pi@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised for simultaneous treatment of pal@@ mon@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or that tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is said to be used neither for prevention nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five investigated chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics in pre @-@ clinical studies ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous activation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience on the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not available , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common at a dose of 250 mc@@ g. to observe side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least were related to Alo@@ xi in connection with head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the meeting place ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ activity relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been performed because of the large distribution volume a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving oral chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) were received , which was given intraven@@ ously to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ itted chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously to day 1 . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on the indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval followed with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; goal of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. administered pallet col@@ on in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
absorption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate throughout the dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
&quot; according to the intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean average ( ± SD ) measured in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular carcin@@ oma patients was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg was equal ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after applying 0.75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron metabolism , so that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of healthy eyes , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimin@@ atory rate and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure to the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be blocked in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose expressed in roughly the 30 @-@ fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is determined for a unique application , the relevance of these results is very low to humans . &quot;
the European Commission must inform the owner of this agreement on the plans to transport the drug approved within the framework of this decision .

June 2006 the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the prohi@@ bit of approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C in the treatment of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended .
&quot; this means Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal herb that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference doctor &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in the case of a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are further increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates this to the formation of the active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s manufacturer submitted data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; in the study , we measured how many patients responded to the treatment after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http :
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after adjusting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was re@@ tar@@ ded in more patients than in the reference doctor ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study for investigating the question to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by br@@ ust formation ) and small infected lo@@ ins ( cracks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against these kinds of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it acts by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke on the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wound , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were examined in Hau@@ tw@@ ound , about 90 % of patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( deep cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 from 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation to the order .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go predomin@@ ate against the risks in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , sc@@ rub@@ bing or stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission informed the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with whom there is no improvement within two or three days should be examined once and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully ab@@ stain@@ ed and proper alternative therapy of infection is started . &quot;
retin@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies of secondary open wounds , retin@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be taken into consideration when there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on scrat@@ ched skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition could not be expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After a simultaneous oral dose of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean retin@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on s@@ worn skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical retin@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go has to be continued / termin@@ ated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation was at the meeting place , which considered about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is ins@@ ulated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ at@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of retin@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by inter@@ acting on a specific binding body of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacter@@ ium ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding unit ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ zentrum .
&quot; binding on this binding site inhi@@ bits pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of retin@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences were found in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
in the case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
absorption In a study with healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ be was put on intact and rested skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place during the days 3 or 4 with the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) was 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirt . &quot;
&quot; metabolism In vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test resp@@ . in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 slo@@ ping skin ) : &quot;
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were determined in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) ; development toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .
&quot; the holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as presented in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the authorization for placing on the market is obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance activities in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as described in the 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Ex@@ other@@ use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP will also be submitted to the next Peri@@ odic Safety update report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated spot , you should quit the use of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not use any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not expressly ordered by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is out of sight on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is available in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure that contains 5 , 10 or 15 gram of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ ent is used as part of an existing vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ isation and is ensured that the vaccine will end up from two cans . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by att@@ aching the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the twin @-@ rix vaccine approved since 1996 , and the vaccine approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three doses of vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contained identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adult were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ ey@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last inj@@ ections .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
&quot; Ambi@@ ent , between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , led one month after the last injection to develop protective anti @-@ antibody concentrations in hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most frequent side effects of Ambi@@ ent ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , red@@ ness , mat@@ th@@ iness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ ent@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission informed the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ tious on the whole
&quot; the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ ent consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ H@@ AV vaccine ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies refer to the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have addressed a vaccine vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic response should always be immediately available for medical treatment and monitoring according to the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardized vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels in these cases , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal impot@@ ence , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , if thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation disturb@@ ances , Ambi@@ enta can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an exception , as in these cases it may be intr@@ amus@@ cular to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ ent was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection , simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ism , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ defects , it is necessary that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ th@@ iness , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thi@@ el@@ age and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 1,0@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ th@@ iness on a calculation base per imm@@ ac@@ ulate setting , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ eri@@ x had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle of 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was small and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ination , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed when administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ey@@ rix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of imp@@ fl@@ es reported regarding severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus , and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted with impot@@ encies in the age of 1 to including 15 years , the dose conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the dose conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out at 12 - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ TXT and 147 received the standard single @-@ dose @-@ vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for 289 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the dose of 3 dose ino@@ cul@@ ation significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which has been reached in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the imp@@ fl@@ es received either a 2 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with ambition or a 3 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ eri@@ x in the 0 @-@ 6 month ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme . &quot;
the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12 - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month V@@ acc@@ ination Sch@@ eme .
&quot; when the first dose Ambi@@ ent was administered simultaneously with the vacc@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ um conversion rates , as for earlier formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing eye to possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in poll@@ uted waters . &quot;
&quot; you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ ent cannot be fully protected from an infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ inations ( though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; • If an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ eri@@ x or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) has been shown to you / your child . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction may manifest through it@@ chy r@@ ashes , breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the commonly prescribed dose of the second vaccine dose ) . &quot;
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / her child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ent .
&quot; instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased level of effective hepatitis A virus ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with decreased levels of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the ino@@ cul@@ ation series .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ ey@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / she / she takes other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated or has been given immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins or has been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given simultaneously with ambition , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as various limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ ent is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; typically , Ambi@@ ent is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is strongly required that they can be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot;
please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) for you / your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 mixed doses ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at the inser@@ tion point or red@@ ness • Mat@@ th@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 mixed doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Re@@ duc@@ ed • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal ail@@ ments
&quot; further side effects , which were reported in two days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 c@@ ased doses ) , are : &quot;
&quot; these include loc@@ alized limited or extended failures , which can itch or be bul@@ b@@ ous , swelling of the eye and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain cr@@ amps , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ concep@@ tions such as ting@@ ling , loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts , severe head@@ aches and sti@@ ff@@ ness of neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;
&quot; impot@@ ence Infl@@ amm@@ ation of some blood vessels un@@ healthy or disease feeling , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea and abdominal pain , increased incl@@ ination to bleeding or bru@@ ises ( bru@@ ises ) caused by falling down the amount of blood . &quot;
23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice side effects not specified in this packing unit .
Ambi@@ enta is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that has become known since the first approval for the market launch , the CH@@ MP res@@ igned the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ enta remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , as Ambi@@ enta was only put into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia ende@@ mic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentration ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is - split on several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a investig@@ ational medicine , i.e. without drug ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , fatigue , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle to high ammon@@ ia levels effectively prevented .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was admitted in &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this drug was available . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 life days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life @-@ month ) , there is an indication for the use when there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient for growth and development .
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ y@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ity@@ tran@@ scar@@ can@@ ine are the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must get ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s tablets may not be given to patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily average . &quot;
AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
&quot; as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ ylene but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and kid@@ neys occurs , AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thereby a han@@ di@@ cap of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MONA@@ Ps is contra@@ indicated while breast @-@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s at 56 % of the patients stood at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , which developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with Lak@@ ef@@ i@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound associated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys .
&quot; sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; 5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ ylene but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine @-@ nitrogen . &quot;
it is important that the diagnosis is established early and the treatment will immediately start to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the earliest manifested form of the disease with the incidence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ low and the disease led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nit@@ ro@@ genous analogue within the first year of life .
&quot; by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative routes of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zene and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first months of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with the time in many of mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ity@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ ogen deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical state can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kid@@ neys with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined using a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in so@@ ber @-@ healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with urine cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentrations , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in plasma next morning after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the central phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma are five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine above the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children , which can not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups ) or a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ ll or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ y@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ity@@ tran@@ scar@@ can@@ ine are the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily average . &quot;
&quot; if rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyram@@ idal cells of the cereb@@ ral c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient , which developed a metabolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with Lak@@ ef@@ i@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ alan@@ ine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ ylene but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical state can occur . &quot;
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ules were determined 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; when a patient has to obtain the medicine by probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot be eliminated after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if lab tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding time , you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s as the medicine could go over to breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste difficulties , rel@@ ays of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice one of these symptoms , immediately get in touch with your doctor or the emergency hospit@@ alization of your hospital . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , stomach ache , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , mal@@ function , kidney function , weight gain , and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly imp@@ air you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this user information .
&quot; you can no longer use AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cover and the container &quot; &quot; us@@ eable to &quot; &quot; exp@@ iry date . &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ MONA@@ PS look and content of the Pack AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are equipped with the &quot; U@@ CY 500 &quot; em@@ bos@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ s to the same single doses or@@ ally or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a higher dose and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a given dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in with regard to all indicators , except for heavy bleeding that was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other mil@@ ud@@ ines or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox was an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during one PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox on the whole European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is envis@@ aged .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous pin of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be added and the inf@@ usion increases to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
&quot; according to clinical requirements , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a stu@@ b should be given from 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an im@@ min@@ ent intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us dose of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to under 225 seconds , a second release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ated and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully bl@@ ended prior to application and the base dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( if treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes must be reviewed again after the second dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after giving the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tional le@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular si@@ par@@ in .
• severe un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and / or ir@@ reversible ag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial end@@ othel@@ ial hyper@@ tension . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis .
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in case of PCI @-@ patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din most bleeding in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment generally everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ira , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is once again the level achieved before treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( h@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ bers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters can be checked regularly in any case . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the band@@ aging or post@@ nat@@ al development are insufficient ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ Dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age in the point position , reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood@@ shed , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages observed at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or throat . &quot;
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ira in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI diagnosis .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as patients over 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice following comprehensive application and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system organ@@ classes . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ira is immediately termin@@ ated and the patient is close mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the Ani@@ on@@ enb@@ ind@@ ent region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in liquid phase or t@@ innitus . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in partially spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was infected with ser@@ um from patients who had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induction of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te generating reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is showing a dose @-@ dependent and conc@@ entri@@ cular anti @-@ inflammatory effect that is supported by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be added and the inf@@ usion increases to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
&quot; according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) , in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated le@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in the A@@ cu@@ ity arm . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to receive a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients undergoing treatment within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a continuous inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose sy@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood , or that the insulin cannot be effectively processed . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from insulin and the change means that it has a faster effect and a shorter active life than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body does not produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the insulin can not be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined by 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ per after six months . &quot;
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human standard insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission approved san@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion into the abdominal area . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin resistance , insulin needs in patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method may result in a change in the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosing or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can necess@@ itate a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin they use and can therefore change when moving the treatment regim@@ en .
&quot; substances which increase blood glucose levels and increase incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tic agents such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c regulation can be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies for reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity showed no differences between intra@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin occurs not in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application . &quot;

&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ination , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause for severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ es@@ izing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate surge in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ izing effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as a normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ cing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than insulin engineered .
&quot; from the data it was clear that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ c@@ emic control is reached , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; the insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was pump@@ ed 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; the insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ emic control as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in given 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) prior to the meal in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the meal in comparison to human nor@@ - mal@@ ign@@ ant , which was 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) was given . &quot;
