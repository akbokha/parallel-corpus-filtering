<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for preventing manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or the melt-coated tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, which are also degraded like Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly used as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole acts like 5 hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less measure than the neurotransmitters to activate receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamine plays a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their re-occurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, was investigated in three studies up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, suffering from severe unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, in 160 patients where the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness with which Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo were compared over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment was examined."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body resorbed the smelting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify diminished in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented more effective than placebo for recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were equally effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common adverse events of Abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled itting), irritation, nausea (drowsiness), irritation, nausea (drowsiness), vomiting, nausea (drowsiness), irritation, nausea (drowsiness), vomiting, insomnia (sleep disturbance) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who mainly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were talking about the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disturbance, if oral therapy is not suitable against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify to the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for abilify amounts to 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disturbance in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4-inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the appearance of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic illnesses and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changes of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole was compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, vomiting), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predisponate for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients treated with abilify symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia, consider reducing the dose or breaking the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a Mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of Mns, all antipsychotics including abilify have to be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"there were however, in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dose, a significant relationship between dosing and response for unwanted decerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, and leads to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is recommended if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased 107% AUC from Aripiprazole while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose-reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'poor' (=" poor ") metabolisers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensively metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after conversion of the CYP2D6- or 3A4 Inhibitors, the dosage of abilify should be lifted to the dose-level before beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data security situation in humans and due to the concerns caused in the animal reproductive studies, this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I disturbance is mediated on the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity for dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disturbance Aripiprazole showed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disturbance Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12 Aripiprazol had a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of Mania such as Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in part over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum-mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylaying of Aripiprazole, N-Dealkyism is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>

<seg id="2038">"the evidence of the efficacy of unborn Awarase is based on two uncontrolled studies involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pretreated with PI."</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006 the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the prohibit of approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C in the treatment of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal herb that is already approved in the EU (also called" "reference doctor" ")."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"furthermore, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after adjusting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retarded in more patients than in the reference doctor; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study for investigating the question to what extent the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection accompanied by brust formation) and small infected loins (cracks or cuts), abrasions and stitched wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections which have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body's surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It acts by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wound, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were examined in Hautwound, about 90% of patients of both groups responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, however, Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (deep cavities in the body tissues) or of infections caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 from 100 patients) is an irritation to the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo predominate against the risks in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, scrubbing or stitched wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission informed the company Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the launch of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with whom there is no improvement within two or three days should be examined once and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the case of a sensitization or severe local irritation by applying Retapamulin ointment, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully abstained and proper alternative therapy of infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical studies of secondary open wounds, retinamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be taken into consideration when there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on scratched skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition could not be expected in vivo (see Section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After a simultaneous oral dose of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol, the mean retinamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on sworn skin of healthy adult men by 81%."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retinamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether breastfeeding continues / terminates or the therapy with Altargo has to be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"in clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo applied, the most commonly reported side-effect irritation was at the meeting place, which considered about 1% of the patients."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is insulated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passaterianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retinamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interacting on a specific binding body of the 50S subunit of the bacterium ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding unit ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptidyltransferasezentrum.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"binding on this binding site inhibits peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retinamulin at least some infection forms should appear questionable, a consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"no differences were found in the in-vitro activity of retinamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a study with healthy adults 1% Retapamulin ointbe was put on intact and rested skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">"516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin ointbe twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place during the days 3 or 4 with the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">"however, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP shirt."</seg>
<seg id="2709">"metabolism In vitro oxidative metabolism of retinamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>

<seg id="2712">"there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 sloping skin):"</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were determined in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-times the estimated human exposure (see above)); development toxicity (decreased body weight of foetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">"the holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the application application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied."</seg>

<seg id="2723">"Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambient is used as part of an existing vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix must be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunisation and is ensured that the vaccine will end up from two cans."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"if a refresher dose of hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given."</seg>
<seg id="2727">"vaccines work by attaching the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" foreign "and generates antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambirix contains the same components as the twin-rix vaccine approved since 1996, and the vaccine approved since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three doses of vaccination."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adult contained identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adult were also used as evidence of the application of Ambieyrix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injections.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"Ambient, between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, led one month after the last injection to develop protective anti-antibody concentrations in hepatitis A and B."</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar in a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most frequent side effects of Ambient (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, matthiness (tiredness) as well as irritability."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"Ambientrix may not be applied to patients who may not be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic)."</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 the European Commission informed the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of Ambitious on the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the standard vaccination plan with Ambient consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"if a vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-HAV vaccine (anti-HBsAg) antibodies refer to the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"it is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons, who have addressed a vaccine vaccination, need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"3 As with all vaccines, an anaphylactic response should always be immediately available for medical treatment and monitoring according to the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardized vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen."</seg>
<seg id="2745">"in the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels in these cases, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be required."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impotence, these injections should be avoided."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"however, if thrombocytopenia or coagulation disturbances, Ambienta can be injected subcutaneous as an exception, as in these cases it may be intramuscular to bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"when Ambient was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection, simultaneously with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussism, inactivated poliomyelia and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"in patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immundefects, it is necessary that there may be no adequate immune response."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"in a clinical trial conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matthiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thielage and preservative-containing vaccine formulation."</seg>

<seg id="2759">"in the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambieyrix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per prop."</seg>
<seg id="2760">"the proportion of impfles reported regarding severe side-effects during the 2-dose inoculation scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- formalininactivated hepatitis B virus, and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different."</seg>
<seg id="2761">"in clinical trials conducted with impotencies in the age of 1 to including 15 years, the dose conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7)."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or upper arm injected or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose sypiegels (sugar) in the blood, or that the insulin cannot be effectively processed."</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from insulin and the change means that it has a faster effect and a shorter active life than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body does not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in case of type 2 diabetes, in which the insulin can not be effectively processed, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined by 0.14% in insulin lisper after six months."</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human standard insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission approved sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH to approve Apidra in the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the abdominal area."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin resistance, insulin needs in patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method may result in a change in the insulin requirement."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosing or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can necessitate a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin they use and can therefore change when moving the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"substances which increase blood glucose levels and increase inclination to hypoglycemia include oral hypoglycemia, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphs, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, under the effect of sympatholytic agents such as beta-blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine, the symptoms of the adrenergic regulation can be weakened or absent."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies for reproductive-toxicity showed no differences between intra- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"podystrophy Wird fails to switch the injection site continuously within the injection unit, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"severe hypoglycerides with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after glucoagination, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause for severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin lulisin the action occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosesizing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate surge in the glucosesizing effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast response as a normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosescing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than insulin engineered.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"from the data it was clear that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-prandial glycemic control is reached, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
