&quot; package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available easier . &quot;
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select settings extensions ... Open the card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install k@@ de@@ base package that &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present . &quot;
the module An@@ alog filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras connector filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default the display begins with the root node of the document , example : Docum@@ entary Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of showing inde@@ xed folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called Tree map . tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is propor@@ tion@@ ate to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . thus , it can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the database description represents a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , rec@@ tan@@ gles have useful color geb@@ anding and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or representation of another file properties such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can determine if it is at all displayed , only when sufficient space for representation is present , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle may be used ( whereby , consequently , representation errors may be set by constraints in the symbol of the Corn@@ wall ) . in addition , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; settings algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed as a rule , that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . &quot;
&quot; how to split the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for inscription and avo@@ idance of space losses due to frame always advantageous the areas to emerge that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ rent branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the super@@ ordin@@ ate entry in order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the photo@@ gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the gallery gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can define the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option frames per line has a slider and a shooting field to set the number of mini @-@ pictures of each row in the gallery .

&quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , enter where the HTML page should be stored . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub @-@ folder by a slider or a shooting field to which level the sub @-@ folders will be included . &quot;
&quot; with the original images , copy the original images to the gallery . &quot;
&quot; using the comment text file , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera image will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and to download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ous ; - albums can be downloaded via the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with you . &quot;
&quot; you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; easy to use , dozens of professional capabilities are available . it works completely in the 16 bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC colour management . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , like &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvements . &quot;
&quot; where ever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problem or wish to report .... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined connection . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer aid one another . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des , we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ box ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ ate ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to announce in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter path names or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you will need to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k will be saved . this path will remain the same for all image folders . &quot;
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ library . setup digi@@ K@@ am Cre@@ ate collections
&quot; if you already have a compilation of images on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . no image will be changed . no picture will be changed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; thir@@ sts recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders , unless there is i@@ ste in hidden folders . this can be done by extrac@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Old List have no photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . further details can be found in the albums section . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ ate your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favorites to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera image will be made available to you to connect to your digital camera and to download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ous ; - albums can be downloaded via the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with you . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) .
&quot; digit@@ alized ; use the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera as@@ . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software for digital cameras , which supports an ever @-@ increasing number of more than 800 cameras . photo 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transferring images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection has meanwhile become outdated . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably from some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators . if Exif @-@ support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not be seen or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; it &apos;s how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ - , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop pictures everywhere : you can lay a picture in another section of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or to another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , record list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this icon view is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos , which have been created by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , are stored in a single album room . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to right click on the album and select the album &apos;s album properties . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set is used to sort or delete albums . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections preferences . &quot;
the album date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with View albums By date .
&quot; the Buttons El@@ dest , average , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the passage of the album . &quot;
sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to choose another photo as a symbol .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; As an album preview &quot; &quot; in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&quot; the collection includes all the photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album for the first time , you must wait for a while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using all preview images in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can change over settings , change settings . select the albums page and customize the preview image to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window .
&quot; photos are all that comes with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; works . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to make a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing images , slides or editing images . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... select . in the digi@@ box , you can view your photos and change them . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . to do this , and how to customize them to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store this data if you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ s and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides two options for turning . the simpl@@ est one is to right click on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview button and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ on ; delete it , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ list &apos; ; organizes your photos with the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the Date View so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stick@@ ers , individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search . &quot;
&quot; if a key@@ word is selected , all photos taken with this key@@ word will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be group@@ ed in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word@@ li@@ ste@@ amer , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word or click on an existing key@@ word . if you click on an existing key@@ word , after clicking on an existing key@@ word , this will become the key@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select del@@ e@@ tion . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by right @-@ clicking and edit the key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word .
to select another photo as an album symbol you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
&quot; to make use of functionality with keywords , you first need to make your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a key@@ word , you can click on the thumb@@ nail in the tree &amp; quot ; My Favorites button . alternatively , you can click on the thumb@@ nail to view the pictures and assign key@@ word from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords attached to it . in this way , you can assign a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was done etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have a photo with key@@ word , this will be shown in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and remove from the keywords menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus , all corresponding images will be shown in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . &quot;
&quot; all elements of the database include names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if the search didn &apos;t find anything , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be done . the results will be displayed in the My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you only have to select the appropriate entry from View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; for more information , see the section The Tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the contex@@ tual menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group , or delete them . additionally , you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; it allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a spon@@ ge it can be enlarged or reduced . if you are drag@@ ging a picture from somewhere on the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; finds the right pictures . also here can be set a threshold .
this tab makes an intuitive map search tool available based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this requires naturally that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em Ligh@@ tly added from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you are using p@@ airing from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas of the same . the right mouse button is displayed in the right @-@ hand area . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tions also work directly out of the lumin@@ aire like F@@ 4 file editing ... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan @-@ turn function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to display the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview , both images will display the same image area . &quot;
the zoom function works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - away from the for@@ e@@ word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process , following the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos prints , sc@@ ans or stores digital photos carries out a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and re@@ use photos . we focus on the processes for digital photographs we can use . we look at downloading , ren@@ aming , converting , group@@ ing , archiving , optim@@ ising , waiting and export@@ ing image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management increases , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , conf@@ ec@@ tures and exports content that may have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
&quot; metadata is defined as data about data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the approach to save both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving solution that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . you must decide whether to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive some@@ time . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found on your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes st@@ acking easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files makes a backup strategy and migration simpli@@ fies . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the option Metad@@ ata saving in the setting page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to enable that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? to do that , you have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos in the further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s take keywords , keywords , as you often call or continue in other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; automatically build the tree for you , res@@ p the images in the correct place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are being tr@@ acked by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata trans@@ forms itself . this is a very coarse representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to just let anyone see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dre@@ aming , having associations , memories , the historical period of time is present , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help Him over the motive that you moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a label . you can even export it for a selection of images . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell chec@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already drives already with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ ation are countless and will be even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic information . you can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export k@@ ml files to Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights , to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . &quot;
&quot; this field holds the work title of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note of the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; this must not necessarily be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here . if the picture is a warehouse photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for individuals and semi @-@ professionals . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; issues : plate failure , plate failure , current violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , desktop prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , common super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photographs or neg@@ atives . this section deals with problems with the so @-@ called new media .
&quot; roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has . &quot;
&quot; in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated as careful and you may not be trusted for longer than a few years . of course , you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 this piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you &apos;ve just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control summary mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , which appears to be a wonder of CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you copy the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study &quot;
&quot; these are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MAR@@ T are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T cannot detect these errors . some of S@@ MAR@@ T &apos;s errors are caused by the im@@ pending failure . some of S@@ MAR@@ T &apos;s errors are caused by errors . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices don &apos;t make much sense , this can cause serious damage in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage to your computer . so , protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result causing a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that part of the energy heat absor@@ bs and flus@@ hes the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector line . remember , however , that not every connector line also contains over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over @-@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even an failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in power failure with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your machine is protected . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . &quot;
you are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . data transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies are contained in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors .
the worst part is that no one says you have occurred when a transmission error occurred . all of these disturb@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you have one day to open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by broadcasting problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle record errors on a low level and highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs File System , which is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used for z@@ fs and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the most commonly think . it leads to less damage than for example theft or new installations , and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical borders . this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural barrier for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensor . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 megapixel cameras . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard disk is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make no one responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year . so secure your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before making any dangerous , such as the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , you hit a flash , you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ iev@@ es are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ Prevention always means not local storage . bring up your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighbouring house , into your office or the like . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for a data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup is made . this backup comes closest to the exception that it is only scann@@ ed and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike scripts @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that have actually been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
save important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; metadata , stored IP@@ TC data , associated X@@ MP files , origin@@ als , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting pictures and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is roughly the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression of the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with you and want to expand the area you want to expand on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary , &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . &quot;
&quot; PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open raw image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provides DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to embed the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo , mostly in the raw format , as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , you should consider whether you are using DNG as containers and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use it as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images again , then you should add the metadata . these were then trun@@ cated by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; see Ad@@ ding a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . if this is the case , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side strips properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information , which are stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image is not yet downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available on some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata , such as Exif , producer &apos;s note , GPS , etc . this information is the same as with the metadata tool@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection from All . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed . during downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the chosen &amp; cons code selection methods . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and download the selected file . the selected button is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not been downloaded yet . in this case , the new images are downloaded with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
the list of existing albums is displayed in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed in the My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; load the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the photos you have downloaded , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you want to delete only some , you must first select them and delete them afterwards . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully removed from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully removed from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so over the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as file names for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually recycled after the photos from the camera are deleted . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made in the fil@@ en@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data to the author in the chapter standard authentication . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the editing panel , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option Camera File name , you have the option of modi@@ fying the file names in lower case letters . or , in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ came ; for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and automatically used , if you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Side@@ bar Metad@@ ata page , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , you can use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the lower range of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , you can automatically create sub@@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date are downloaded to the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can check what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to disable this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ column at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button downloading . select then Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , queries &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; you , where the images are to be loaded . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ds and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be calculated from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with one click , which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how come the GPS data in the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ites and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS recei@@ vers . either as map module or by transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to store these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o mapping module . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool from Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pron@@ oun@@ cements to be created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show European street maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . you can switch between these , by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image processing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; fix when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copy@@ ri@@ ghted data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected when downloading from the camera plate . also with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should include the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to give the one that offers the photo . this must not be the author when it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the image is a warehouse photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this means that the metadata is permanently included in the picture , and not just in the database of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without being lost . &quot;
&quot; saving image cap@@ tions as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the inscri@@ ptions included in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cur@@ sor rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; display , you can add and remove the file extensions to this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ box ; Album Fol@@ der that will not have these extensions will be ignored . &quot;
default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Up@@ gra@@ ding right from each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size lad@@ en@@ quot ; should you only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar , if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing mode this picture mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off .
Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling is meant that images can be enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia as a closer explanation .
&quot; it does not reduce image quality because PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TIFF files , you can comp@@ ress the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF photos . it has no effect on image quality since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the setting los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the scann@@ ed green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensi@@ tively to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , photograp@@ hed on a white card that was photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the pointed lights , so the parts of your pictures are burned in , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as a penet@@ rating white . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions of the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to recon@@ struct the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture . &quot;
&quot; put the L@@ umin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to put it a little higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing in small , you should be conservative . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ construction .
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w provides you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue maintenance values here . this is certainly the best method for a color adjustment correction , as you are done during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; information such as color information from a color space to the other can be translated to the colors as accurately as possible .
&quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , when an image is opened in the image processing / image management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color profile folders Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , in which you save all of your profiles . &quot;
settings of the ICC profiles you have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed later when the raw file is opened .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model that you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which does not include color mapping or g@@ amma correction . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can have a very saturated color . this could be corrected manually , rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately not in Canon models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile expansion lets you see the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portraits and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing ; many modules support , which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adjust@@ s the time between the picture transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . &quot;
&quot; on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Autom@@ atically Det@@ ection that tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . below are the serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn it on . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; setting a photo in an album . del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details . &quot;
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the splash screen from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; stop at startup . this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed under certain circumstances .
&quot; setting Bei@@ m start looking for new pictures forces &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos ; this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; if something has been deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; you , if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ at ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings Design . a preview of available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; contains fast image processing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image , or through the context menu of the entry / editing window . &quot;
&quot; the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ at , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section image editing . &quot;
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; edit editing functions change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
you should possibly add a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save As .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore menu or using the knob Rest@@ ore to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last time . &quot;
&quot; almost every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing undo or restoring , by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer through the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a pop @-@ up menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you &apos;ve made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying the magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
view full screen mode indicates the full screen mode . you will enter the normal view in which you can use the Es@@ c key . normally the tool@@ bar will be displayed .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or entire sets . all images can be selected from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and choose from the menu Album Export Control Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , even in the image processing . it will appear when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple @-@ clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
&quot; in the inscription view , you can enter cap@@ tions with unlimited size or insert . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ s and IP@@ TC fields , so that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling area in other applications , you should observe these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or switch to the next image , the labels are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation diagram shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ ding . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the assessment is carried out in the ur@@ gency of the IP@@ TC field . the enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with previously used keywords . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set in the tree by marking the corresponding check boxes . all keywords of an image are stored key@@ word in the IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , please read the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the key@@ word@@ filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - data , key@@ word and search queries . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter reads no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched on under Settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or one , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already placed in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can choose an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then using the group@@ ing button . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come a predictable vari@@ ance from the actually photograp@@ hed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resem@@ ble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; when the theme is on colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results they want . unfortunately , colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should you use a different colour space and make thoughts about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent page and click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; if you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor because s@@ RGB assumes that your on@@ itor is installed on s@@ RGB , then you must either cal@@ li@@ fy your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alizing , Compar@@ ison , Automatic Comp@@ are and Con@@ tr@@ ast Exten@@ ds from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ise Autom@@ ati@@ cal Cor@@ rection automatically try to make the best out of your colors . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see what works best with your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ous values over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; same : this method adjust@@ s the intensity factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same amount of brightness reaches the same number of pixels . sometimes the same is very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; automatic Compar@@ ison : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area . &quot;
add contrast : this method enhances the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the wid@@ est possible area and a re@@ ji@@ us@@ cation of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is a little limited since the color space is 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , then it &apos;s enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
thumb@@ nail preview features a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dim also . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load do exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you set can save you in a text file and load it later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button delet@@ es all fil@@ ter@@ values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the enco@@ ding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this enco@@ ding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF , and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted by the chapter colour management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool color effects provide four color effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar isation , also called sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of the additional light . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper of the additional light . the result was a partial negative image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar radiation . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is edited ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an altered colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . with large images , the filter can rel@@ ieve the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ common to change the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied . &quot;
&quot; if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can be a good choice for satur@@ ation rather than raising them . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on tone correction for the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and take care of how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right you can see the original and preview of the picture . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the picture . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can adjust whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to create the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used , for example , to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is in the foreg@@ round . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this knob , the image values are automatically placed depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
save as and load : using these buttons the values stored in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and later re@@ charged . to do so the Gim@@ p level format is used .
&quot; when using this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result . &quot;
&quot; intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
more modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images photograp@@ hed with a digital camera , linear mode causes a wide bar . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cur@@ v@@ epi@@ ece to the right e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that become dark@@ er with the corresponding image pixels . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photos is a red marker to see . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve showing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve generated by you can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cam format .
&quot; activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you are found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ate channel . shadow and sun tones have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ box ; editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer from Edi@@ ting Edi@@ ting .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image features a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction permit you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you activate the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient if you also activate the color components option , since the channel bl@@ ender then DAS tool to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color will result in a visible noise coming from the colour@@ ing . colour@@ ing consists of small room arti@@ facts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose smoking patterns are different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color noise first . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer placement later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel bl@@ ender format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; black / White photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;

green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good with all scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; Oran@@ ge@@ Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate light lun@@ ches at day@@ time . similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shade . this is very similar to the process of dro@@ pping a pressure and the recovery in a sep@@ ia . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture apply , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter Relief has been set to 200 .
add the &amp; digi@@ box ; add tool box to add a decorative setting to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a spect@@ ator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the moving eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . permanently surround the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : specify the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the picture decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing pictures , especially if you have used the tool to cut the aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can insert easily a form@@ atted text into a picture at any location . this also goes in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text execution , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool template , you can place a template over an image . &quot;
the menu Image Template apply in the image processing can be used to place templates over an image .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . &quot;
&quot; when using this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the knob base folder . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will update the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; small : this knob uses the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improved the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photos without focus and most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digi@@ tization process colours with only minimal differences to a col@@ on . elements that are smaller than the resolution are thus to be combined to a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more after@@ ward shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
JPEG images often have a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format on the other hand must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
&quot; some scann@@ ers already use a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter during reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing movement . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges . in general , the most useful technique for sharp@@ ness of an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus it using the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little bit sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry basket sof@@ tens and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . increasing the radius or the amount increase the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are generated close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius defines how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution pictures allow larger radi@@ i . therefore you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mascul@@ ine filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; mould re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Desig@@ ned Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtration . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a sharp@@ ness mask .
&quot; in practice , circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß @-@ F@@ itting . the Gau@@ ß Plateau has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ae that are far from the original source pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should yield 1 good results . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is . this is most commonly caused by a previously executed un @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ed filter . in most cases , you should use this parameter to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circle @-@ shaped sharp@@ ness or the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set is stored for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but the later unpleasant arti@@ facts left behind . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ ring meas@@ ur@@ ers produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ ring a larger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in theory , bl@@ ur masks must always generate art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vienn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ ear Filter . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in handling small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original unclear Colour picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
&quot; the regulator Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area of the dark@@ ened , in order to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see blue eyes instead of dark , you can set this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove undes@@ ired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail hus@@ band@@ ry p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . &quot;
&quot; action dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es equally in all directions while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ular@@ ity or CCD noise will produce a high value und@@ ulating pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness factor above all@@ . p defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . normally ranges from 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle progres@@ sions &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More of quality you get by selecting this option is only minor , but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to leave it out . &quot;
the buttons save as and load exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a unique black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need further information on sensor screws from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window and the Advanced Settings window can stay with default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance between the filter to the front . if it is increased , noise tips will be cleared . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication appears again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong you can not remove the whole noise or smoke peaks may occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ant of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the thickness tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically m@@ apped . however , it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter atten@@ uation . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of lumin@@ ance . when it is elevated , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters to reduce the noise you set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharp@@ ens . use tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ ter with the menu entry basket sof@@ tens and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Photo restoration is definitely one of the fur@@ th@@ est developed tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ ired art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove the pal@@ ate &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local mistakes that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture release . the texture is performed with another tool , the image missing correction , and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm he generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ ts@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any adjustment of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button ending . &quot;
the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera is taken to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gran@@ ular@@ ity on the faces .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures reduce to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanning and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Hot@@ pixel tool allows to remove the Hot@@ pixel from photos with a CCD camera gem , eight were deleted . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark@@ picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wiz@@ ard with the Dark Image button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous paragraph , you should download the appropriate dark image to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will detect the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : it is determined an average of the adjacent pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixel in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block . &quot;
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo formats , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; however , it also has dis@@ advantages . many center @-@ filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed in circumstances that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use with Center Filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise dis@@ advantages occur by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and the color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of an center filter by applying an equivalent transformation at a rough image that is done without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction addresses the transformation with an cent@@ er@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , what an optical filter with a aper@@ ture of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate a light intensity of 2 , h@@ ul@@ .@@ In@@ cre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction dimin@@ ishes the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ ci@@ fication in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; linear distor@@ sion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . colour@@ ing distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geomet@@ rical distortion .
&quot; general : this value controls the power of distortion second degree . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the dist@@ orted fourth degree . this value affects the edges rather than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thereby results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
&quot; bright : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
the t@@ onn@@ e- or con@@ ical correction should be performed before all cuts or size changes . best do this correction as the first . if you cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction the effect would be obvious to the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea margin or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ e- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove this with the cutting tool in the trans@@ former cutting tool from the image processing or over the zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some subjects such as shots from the front , frames and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . keep in mind that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film gran@@ ular@@ ity if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gran@@ ular@@ ity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter uses colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photographs , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ me@@ et@@ ect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter film gran@@ ular@@ ity is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; the film gran@@ ular effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ened from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the standard value is , although often higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter Oil Pain@@ ting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter Oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
&quot; two controls exist to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better suited for large pictures . smooth control the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is lab@@ elled with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel big image is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . the lines , which define the outline in the drawing , are emphasized . &quot;
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper slider sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth@@ ed ) .
this is an example of the coal label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter engraving defines your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped into wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important one . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape . &quot;
&quot; depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave poles 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look like it is viewed through glass blocks .
&quot; wave poles 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button ending .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of bl@@ ur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a focal point . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing a zo@@ oming camera and thus generates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pe the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograp@@ hing , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ ks the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a random moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of drops . as the dro@@ ple@@ t size is not automatically increased with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the visual effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; edit image processing a area free of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ ps , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the menu trans@@ former turning or transformation mirrors . &quot;
bli@@ sters are definitely one of the fur@@ th@@ est developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or gu@@ essed the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select trans@@ former size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to close the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing up . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying Algorith@@ m photo was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
&quot; keep aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
the buttons &apos; Save as &apos; and &apos; load &apos; are used exactly for this purpose . it can be saved as text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; blowing photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and draw a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button ending . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard aug@@ mentation compared .
&quot; editing a photo is not just a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you just have to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and moving the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . you can create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ tr@@ l button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as high @-@ format or landscape format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the horizontal format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are cen@@ timeter , In@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . relationship Button opens the area for cutting to the wid@@ est possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are saved in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data mirror the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the cooperation aid allow you to hide aids , so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden mean : the golden mean is a dividing that is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sels or the leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which used to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden centre . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer to achieving good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ rule the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition results the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also der@@ ive from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . its ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place on these lines can leave a static object more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise . &quot;
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al and Ver@@ tical options can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the color button you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines in your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it easily happens that you keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; edit image processing and tool free rotation . select trans@@ former free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider An@@ gle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after turning a picture , you will find undes@@ ired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function trans@@ former trimm@@ ing from the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic crop function . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : indicates the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new Height : indicates the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left top : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed region .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed region .
angle left bottom : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture will be a bit dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is dist@@ orted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module on trans@@ former sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using Horiz@@ ont@@ al An@@ gle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ ar , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ ew@@ ings produce twice as much understanding and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after firing , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ former cutting from image processing . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the formats available depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on its system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; this is done based on file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions . you can change this list of file extensions . see the Con@@ figuration section for more information . &quot;
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced , thus saving the image data to a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there is better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less when it is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; supports loading raw images with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is in &amp; digi@@ ous ; all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed : &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short movies . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . and digi@@ ti@@ sed , but is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . &quot;

many tools you need the photo editing you need in &amp; digi@@ pack ; contain your description here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs , noise suppression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ ry masks , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable &quot; &quot; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it five buttons allow the comparison mode of the preview area to change . these modes are :
&quot; ver@@ tically , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left side shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area . &quot;
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
the left side shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper part shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter . &quot;
mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and click on the part of the image , from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noticed .
the Properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab makes an intuitive map search tool available based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this requires naturally that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m Curs@@ or is enabled under the color button , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cur@@ sor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box over@@ writing under Bei@@ m Curs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Insert . &quot;
&quot; use the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a pointing mark , if another color follows . if there are three figures in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color pic@@ ker on the left .
&quot; graph is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ ene . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ ene . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphic ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; GUI ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; &amp; &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re @-@ calcul@@ ates the graph and displays in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems from about 1000 k@@ not and one h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
&quot; additional software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs . required are : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is bigger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview using the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file is changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later it will be done . if you want to change your decision later , you can configure the menu item Settings k@@ graphic viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; open &amp; eg a graph file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; or to display the graphs in a sub @-@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the start of the program , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph is to be split up to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are on one side , should be fitted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
side preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with another font
you can set a default behaviour ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
opening the page opens the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; when a graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( opening the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to set the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can set a default behaviour ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked at any start .
&quot; the context menu , which appears usually with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up other possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; the algorithm tables hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directional graphs . the algorithm tables edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statisti@@ cally multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; -@@ Algorith@@ m creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for un@@ eri@@ ed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ eh@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the S@@ wan project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default default duc@@ er , to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start with the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the lower right corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure that the window will appear completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button scanning you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image will appear . please remember that the type BM@@ P will not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; you must also select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the menu Imp@@ or@@ tier@@ - &gt; Screen Photo ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have chosen the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay controls how long screen shots will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other desktop , you should select this delay up enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot was made , the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF map words and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , longitudinal and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . in order to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains naturally data that were recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file loads , an automatic correlation takes place which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here . &quot;
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . is the devi@@ ation below which the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and Differ@@ ence in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the knob cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog will notice the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and zoom in . select this again and again until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the map can be selected manually between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adapted . the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ft@@ show &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your related images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is shown as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change pictures without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of color information takes place . this can be found for example also with the PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see what formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ dec module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG Enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . you can also add a audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Layer . afterwards you can create the module to start the module via extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you selected are then listed under picture files in the Portfolio . there you can also change gra@@ ding the images respectively the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and path of the generated file can be set by name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a hint appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages using the Settings button at the bottom . &quot;
the print wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing g@@ im@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; first , select the RAW file to be converted and launch the module . the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further process the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to process your pictures frequently or later on , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Output button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , if you are safe , for example by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . &quot;
this module can be used to convert all images into an album . it uses the convert convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 d@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
&quot; proportional ( 2 dim . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your picture to the screen format . &quot;
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent .
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images selected from you . you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent .
remove images from the list of images to be sent .
&quot; after you have selected all images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you selected are already attached to the attachment . &quot;
do not make sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions for the size of mails sent . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used again and again until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must enter the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transi@@ tions option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option will show that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then start with Es@@ c manually .
&quot; the option to select pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not the order of the pictures in the album . &quot;
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly select another effect in any transition between the images .
&quot; during the slideshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and the next picture and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not yet have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through these browsers , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; with this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to some single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images next to the names , select the button located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can e.g. show symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; in the view window , you can select the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image view window ( in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you access the search in the main window , a dialog will appear that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you type a string into the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions respectively descriptions of the images will be searched by this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but prefer to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the fast entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos . &quot;

first enter the title of the header and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page . for more information about export files you will find in .
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is visible to the viewer without a description . for example , all pictures are exported from a party . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this is not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images which for example have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting range , set the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you have to select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically completed next time . you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the shared folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external files . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML Pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the pictures of the URL that you have given when creating the HTML files will be scann@@ ed . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ Export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can access via the Export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices for you :
&quot; to copy the manual into the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; photo@@ album automatically close to the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be up to 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , will &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard for import is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you are the category people of the import@@ ing file ( if you are a domain ) while this category belongs to your database people . therefore , you are asked in the third dialog window to import which categories of the imported file are imported and what categories they are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will go through the different steps of the ( 1 ) set of information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to back up a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and use it in future starts automatically . if you want to start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; in the following section of the User Manual , the various settings options are explained in the following section of the User Manual . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which you can access by pressing the F1 key and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select an inscription and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left @-@ hand window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , you can find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of several applications are shared among themselves , it can be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the command line using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I would have not warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this sort of order isn &apos;t supported , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules to use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ate &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you have set up as a category for virtual albums in the Settings dialog . for example , if you use the category people , you will have to do it , so if you have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and a tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people depicted on the image , where the image is taken . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , since you can always use them when you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are m@@ apped , you can , by doing so , that the names used are moved up to find people faster and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and add these pictures with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the upper right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these pictures and use the menu item Various entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S. . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you will see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it in an sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... , which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide the box . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and click on the window . &quot;
&quot; for example , see here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be created as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the Rem@@ ove button or select in the Edit selection menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&quot; photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example , you have to save images somewhere , with it &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be downloaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so the thumb@@ nails may show you the preview of these pictures . however , you can &apos;t see these images with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function needs you to copy files out of folders and then copy them back into . if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance about how to avoid confusion of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all pictures on it . &quot;
&quot; in the View menu , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , you filter the pictures so that at the end of those that you want to make for others and click Current View locking in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all images that your little sister can see , and choose the menu entry Every@@ thing except for current view . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , allowing all images that you have locked , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply choose the password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand you can read or delete all images on your hard drive , and on the other hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml can only read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only to those who are not very familiar with the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours of hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer inside . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered over the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it elsewhere . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded more images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can enter in the image and zoom out . with the mouse button , you can simply draw a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom into the middle of the image again . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity sets the zo@@ oms so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos will work in and out with the plus and minus t@@ ass@@ el .
&quot; with the turning functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you look one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to create images with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by clicking on the characters A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have attributes to your pictures , they are available in your browser . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview image . if you can view categories in the preview image , you can simply press the characters to the pictures by simply clicking the characters for the feature after the image was selected . &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you can use photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
you can see an image on which painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to end the painting just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties properties and the object is shown in the wire mode views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub @-@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ Objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu entry in the Insert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a error description . then , you can correct the input errors and undo the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a level of visibility as a wi@@ re@@ model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected , or the level of visibility selected in the tool@@ bar of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views on one another , drag the star@@ board right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map tags top in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the star@@ board onto the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing to the left in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the tool@@ bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it at any location . &quot;
the current window view allows you to save window layout ... save . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ ders icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view render scene render . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality steps , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sensible is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check section sub@@ section and enter the rendering of the image to the input fields . &quot;
in the drop down sel@@ ector quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one beam , different errors can occur . these images often have a fashion pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling rate the neighboring pixels . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels , which are followed individually and will be checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflex@@ ion comp@@ utes . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify if the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object hit .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished you can find the reason for this .
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , select the menu entry File Import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when import@@ ing , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene returns . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . place the path to your copy and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type distingu@@ ishing marks .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values show a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail stage separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you display a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you display floors , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the smoothing algorithms , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and thres@@ holds in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window orders section , explains how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the existing window orders show all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ts anchor the window under the existing window , with boxes you will find a card map view together with the previous view and floating strongly anch@@ ored the view not in the main window but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a bullet on a level . &quot;
&quot; however , you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tool@@ bar icons . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the App@@ ly button or enter button , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result you see here the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a cube ( inser@@ ting final body boxes ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this problem . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now shows the level , even though at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , then change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; just select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select First Sub@@ ject . the pig@@ ment will then be displayed in the object tree ( Name = So@@ il Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button , see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment only shows a matt black material because you have to type settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , please always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on Pre@@ view . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the simpl@@ est . &quot;
&quot; if you see no color on the header and ball in the preview , click App@@ ly to App@@ ly and then retrieve the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should obtain the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; you should already just execute this step , because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the button user ) , so the sphere would float above the ground , as you moved the bottom to one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , place a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the ground , give the sphere a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; first , select sub@@ Objects and change the name for example in Or@@ b Pig@@ ment . click &quot; &quot; Pig@@ ment &quot; , &quot; then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities do you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have effect . thus , the scene pixel is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files typically have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ t command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can use this option Tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a dump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without using any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in one &apos;s own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return Return .
you can choose to see if each image should be displayed in your own window or whether all images should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a certain file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the Dialog Set@@ ting - &amp; Ball Show ; there are five map cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ball show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this reduces the delay when you select the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when you exit the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ball show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set up &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; to set up just a few of the file types that the program can display .
&quot; with this option , the display window is magni@@ fied to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
determine whether the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; here , change the short@@ cut for the different operating modes of &amp; ball show ; in the card cards , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; Ball show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
displaying the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message . &quot;
&quot; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; in this mailing list , however , English speaking , you should therefore be strong in this language . &quot;
the best start to join &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&quot; you can change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you have to switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the range of exposure indicators , you can select the color which is displayed when the sub or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should indicate , in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure to indicate a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also view the same side@@ bar in the image editing page . you can view them by clicking on one of the five riders :
&amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes it possible to scan and save images .
&quot; &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images . for each image , save a dialog to save or save images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display images before saving . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search site : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; with the command check@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not open or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed drivers . &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options particularly .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can start a preview and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits in the window . &quot;
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will save and lie ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the dialog box is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option before saving a preview should be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option has to be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way &amp; channels ; images to select . open dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of any scann@@ ed image . if you want to save this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to select saving without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
the default value is your home directory and you can change it using the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images and is furthermore the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix that is recorded each time a picture is saved . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can customize the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts K@@ DE help with the &amp; check@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; the knob settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end .

&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other short@@ cut short@@ cuts . below is a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , and choosing short@@ cuts . &quot;
you can set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts . this will make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
&quot; you should give the user feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all the needed modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the simpl@@ est way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should include any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow for exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . to do this , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure is the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information about the new piece ( for example metadata or piece length ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title enhances the path to the selected files of the playlist when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Title are also passed to enable the script to remove the cli@@ ck@@ able entry . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ customiz@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b ; downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally also be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages right .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of Amar@@ ok springs , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulty when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; as most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script at compile time . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any effort on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards for adjusting the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; in the Player window , the player window will add or remove the playlist . if the option is turned off , only the playlist window is displayed . &quot;
use bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
mood files in music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this option is enabled .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stores ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is required .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically at the exit of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist in the exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the current piece visible , the play@@ lists window will pop up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window . &quot;
&quot; when changing to the context @-@ browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance Section , you can customize the appearance of Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray text section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of customized color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector used below for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue playing at startup , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback automatically continues with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last exit . &quot;
&quot; set up the O@@ SD sub@@ window . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font you want for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the ability to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color selection opens the dialog to select color selection . if own colors do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
the input field Display Text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering Plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify what the O@@ SD should appear on the screen of a multi @-@ user environment .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate even more settings in this card .
the map card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to do with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; Browse the sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the checked as well as their sub@@ folders will search for music . &quot;
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector drivers : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected there is another setup needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l facility is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will the machine enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the card board last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
sending played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar performers call : after activ@@ ating this setting becomes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can see the list in context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) .
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find B. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . then you can delete the file and let the collection again .
it is mostly due to the fact that Tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature .
&quot; make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic switch when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into Met@@ a @-@ Infos , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &apos; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the status De@@ activ@@ ates to Gra@@ y and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any colored Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are solved most easily by using an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also help with other users or developers .
&quot; bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error , if there is something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; just a blank playlist will appear . how do music pieces go there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; in order to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start -@@ sub@@ window was changed into the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for review by the user while points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click anywhere in the new review column to specify the review for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cut Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your choice and then select From playlist removed from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop them there as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click it . &quot;
&quot; probably missing the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel program . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is loud which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; you may use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included in default ( for patent law reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter key &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play mp3 &apos;s : - )
&quot; if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must deliver a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously equi@@ p audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different ink ( for example , sink ) . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with utmost priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buff@@ ers ( warning , see next point in the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fier of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either do not use the Arts @-@ driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia to get the faster Arts @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ds _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less hits respond the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all the components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in module folders ( you will find the module folder with gst @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute it again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic k ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are arous@@ ed by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to learn the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username using your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size variable window . &quot;
&quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the enter button after searching in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control panel ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS disk . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it will open a file browser with several folders . to normal read@@ out , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folders in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has each individual rating on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can drag the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then , you can edit the evaluation of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select rating or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog Metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers do not want to present you when you are supposed to publish a stable release of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan , which is not assembled with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , but some users can easily find annoying . des@@ elect the option icon when playing in the General Settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Tool@@ bar settings ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context browser design , click New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was too similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation system allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you browse in the kon@@ quer@@ or . start kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the button settings ( the top ) and select in the Add @-@ up menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please check the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile this output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
&quot; you need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package separately . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; I get the message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
if is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play a MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio Output you enter the device . typically for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog , and output is on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick while the sound card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio issue with Arts is not being taken care of . you may of course gladly take this issue yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new urgently needed main@@ tainer for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; to listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like your collection , or the wiz@@ ard just don &apos;t like , then this quick start guide will be a help . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from your collection browser to the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them using the Play@@ list Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add it to the playlist browser . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio CD protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . besides , some additional packages are listed which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a playlist window contains several browsers , with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used including creating a collection and playlist .
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window , there is a run@@ time display showing the currently running track or current stream . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ sers , including the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also located . the PL button is enabled or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control and piece @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . use the playback buttons to start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio providers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check@@ box equ@@ ali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that it does not exist in any other player . however , don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists can be divided into two main areas , on the left side of the navigation . in the navigation area , you will find some of the most excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays different information about the current part . its look can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window starts away . the information presented there are now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information in the statistical window can be viewed ( extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window Music shows information about the currently running track , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its valuation .
&quot; the images can have any name but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the images can also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer .
you can choose which information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you &apos;ll see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it and then select one of the possibilities to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using the help of self written script . if no text script runs , you can choose which is to be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the search button opens a search for google.com after the lyrics for the current part ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing performer - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing performers / album - first the pieces are arranged according to performers , and there will be another division after the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under Various Interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing performer / year - album - S@@ orted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 is related to Alb@@ um@@ name . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your songs are sorted by genre first and sorted by performer .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album beneath the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you have something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , it might take a while . &quot;
&quot; directly under the tool@@ bar , there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection box , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select your entire collection from the last 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ ases the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set the pieces in queu@@ es - this feature adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you &apos;ll be asked for a name in which the list is to be stored .
&quot; transfer to media player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; all pieces of this performer burn / burn to CD - Dad@@ dy the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot;
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece @-@ information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files into the bin file ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; select as a compilation , select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear under Various interpre@@ ters . &quot;
the album will no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
&quot; the play@@ lists browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click the Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Pan@@ Media Player is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( eg . iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpreter sorted in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the required titles from the playlist and drop them on the list of performers . &quot;
&quot; the Tool@@ bar is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because all files are hidden in the file list , that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar where you can get music from a given URL . for example , if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; when the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachments of files can be difficult by simply dro@@ pping . in that case , holding the Shift key can be helpful . in this case , dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries by drag@@ ging the entries into the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces will be displayed , which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty . &quot;
&quot; when you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; searches for entries containing all search terms . if you enter , for example , two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all the pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; you can combine these syntax @-@ versions at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher score than 50 and do not contain the comment . &quot;
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click on the entries in the desired order . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button with which you can add the playlist to the playlist . to the right , you can find the playlist , empty playlist and fold . &quot;
next follow the buttons undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , enlarged Analy@@ zer . the refres@@ h rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , such as ren@@ ditions and volume control buttons . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar in general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached through a click with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; behind this entry , there is a sub @-@ menu containing links to this document and other information on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &quot;
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can launch them by selecting Ac@@ tions Cover Management in the Collection Browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue administration received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear in the playlist . this number represents the order in the list : 1 will play first , 2 second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . then you can change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ set ( the details to set up these sequences later ) . &quot;
&quot; fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , adding more random pieces while playing . &quot;
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
&quot; double click on the playlist , drag them into the play@@ lists window , or right @-@ click on it and then choose the store . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the two default Mix and Play@@ lists Mix will immediately fill your playlist , and you can start playing directly from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as start point . &quot;
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist editing opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit . this opens the dialog to edit the playlist settings .
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for coming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are to be stored at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the Settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists to be crossed . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click Set@@ ting .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can install scripts by installing on script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own script , please refer to the section writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the Dialog @-@ Window Visual LightBox is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compression formats , remember that you will get a bad quality in the re @-@ coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ c@@ t@@ ect project . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start guide will show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;

&quot; &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD tracks in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode , or DA@@ O ) based on a text description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually , automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality with burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Enco@@ der modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 Enco@@ der Module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; L@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . &quot;
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio Enco@@ der Module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu provides a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file Save .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any not stored project to do so as if you would have called for each project file closing .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ stored project will be asked what to do with it as if you called file closing .
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project by the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you want to enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added in the base folder of the CD will appear . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; to the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here , you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described about the What is this ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . it is useful for you to use files for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium . &quot;
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
&quot; open the CD @-@ Copy dialog . it also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without the project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you then can burn later . furthermore , you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; open the DVD copy dialog . it also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without the project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a DVD which you then can burn later . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog will burn to a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask for an * .@@ iso file as a data source which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
&quot; this dialogue window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , enco@@ ding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
&quot; if this is checked , a small strip is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view turns on or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is activated , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu containing functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the Content View allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the Content View is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ strip is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ strip does not have a real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard layout below . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . with this you can set the right per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can configure general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is designed for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality may be controlled by a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and type of task will be crucial to which of the attached programs will give you the default . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume you are using the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all have common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Alternative can be obtained via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface that applies only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Producer ) void ad@@ dur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void mess@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String null ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT sc@@ dur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ select for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read out and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ ding these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , will be used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all of these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the enco@@ der packages are not required . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of the reading of a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to the comprehen@@ sion for the lean approach of the user interface , about which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is manually captured . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , you find more information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB requests the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case must first connect to the Internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if enco@@ der is configured in the enco@@ ding settings tab in the setup directory - enco@@ ding .
&quot; a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available enco@@ ders , allowing the selection to be read with another enco@@ der than the default . note that previously the enco@@ der has been configured in the enco@@ ding settings tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so an already selected file will be selected for enco@@ ding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; to read and code . &quot;
&quot; open the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as exec@@ uting the &amp; CD ; ex@@ its ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ ders , to set the enco@@ der ) . here , you need to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates , and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other as &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and barely available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nonetheless supplied free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high to very high audio quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG downloads is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - these devices mostly support MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
--@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , and the enco@@ der program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , which information can be downloaded , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is important to note that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less valuable information , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ lic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to actively choose a check box ( sending an address ) . in this way of configuration , it seems , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who reviewed the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , searching in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this has not been done yet . &quot;
&quot; on the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and read work on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame must already be installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine as it is not fully free software . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is likely to be done only once , and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the enco@@ der used to comp@@ ress the music ( l@@ ame ) , as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them for each reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the read@@ out program to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a view into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map card General settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is so left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , you can choose to be informed when you are missing data for generating keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while exec@@ uting the &amp; CD ;
&quot; the second sel@@ ector box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; it can be easily changed if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , it can easily be changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields will need to be selected , at least the first . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section above fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your neighborhood .
&quot; both of them work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls stack the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ ly reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so just try it yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , tick this to the &amp; CD ; to throw out at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / the path / folder can be specified in which the files are stored in the private folder . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to make yourself something with the wa@@ v files . &quot;
&quot; the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ ashed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ c@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of WAV files at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than a .@@ wa@@ v file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD . if you chose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you will never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the disk exp@@ ires . we will build up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successful fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to collect data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not been done yet , the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; if this is not done , go to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD was successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all songs of the songs are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database but retrieve the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 By step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece . the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are considered common for all pieces of the CD .
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD Edi@@ tors so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words are beginning with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . &quot;
&quot; you can change tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats . see the help for enco@@ der to get more information .
for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
the window of the CD @-@ Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and then proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the piece list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure that all the pieces are selected or press the All Pi@@ eces on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
&quot; when selecting the selected reading process by clicking on the button sel@@ ects the reading process , then this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what happens . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab Or@@ ders to turn on the Order window . it is in the left half of the window , right beneath the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is read straight to the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a code you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folders ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of item 1 into the format MP3 . this is done to read out and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code .
&quot; now the last song is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time appears in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. respectively 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is already done . if you read this , you probably already did it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is addressed to persons compiled from source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many variations in settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen shots of different map cards of the settings and includes comments for options , which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still to read ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first startup of the program , without any indication as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of program start no audio CD ; in the drive is located ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
who reads this has probably started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can not keep this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual too &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa will be included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag &amp; drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows on k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( event events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the applied process .
&quot; session support . if you quit and k@@ de ; quit playing a song , k@@ mid starts next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the File menu . it will pop up the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button play in the tool@@ bar , select the play button from the piece menu or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played after each other . )
&quot; once you play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving with the slider . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the left and right of the tempo display and thus change the speed of playback . to reg@@ ain the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu piece , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event ; others use lyrics events and again others . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will automatically be determined which a song is used , so that you do not have to manually set up a song . however , if you activate the entry Automatic text selection in the Settings menu , you will have the option to change this if you want to see the other type . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set the event type , select the text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section you &apos;ll find how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones at the beginning .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the counter@@ f@@ eit in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when applying the application , this collection is not stored . consider this if you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection .
&quot; when Autom@@ atically Add to the collection is enabled , a piece to open ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu play sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to ski@@ p a song , select the Next song button , the next song from the menu piece or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role since it is not saved when leaving . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events of Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus always sound a trumpet when playing a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound card , do not need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards GM -@@ KO@@ MP@@ AT@@ IB@@ LE are ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . you need to edit the corresponding file from your source ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required compositions for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as many times as desired . &quot;
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE Key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that DE@@ F@@ INE is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
&quot; in this section , it is stated how the Pat@@ ches of General MIDI to be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a rif@@ le shooting ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a rif@@ le shot . &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( net income ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , in which each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
&quot; as with PAT@@ CH@@ MAP messages , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map tones to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , just make it in CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option all events will be ignored which attempt to change the patch on this channel .
&quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio pitch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , is supposed to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to an oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; running around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Page MIDI Settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pian@@ os you see what sounds are played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not turn green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the channel channel view : settings
&quot; the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a typical MIDI file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to fix the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agree , so support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , activate Autom@@ atically Add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo you can double click on the LCD .
&quot; I have a &amp; conc@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off Autom@@ atically Add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ Schmidt . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the Autom@@ atically Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection will then contain exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming . &quot;

Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the error that the pitch was too high on AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thank you Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile and compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is used to play video files created by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help , please check the website The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ cher windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links from the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the selected entry . &quot;
&quot; the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , select it from the View menu and select next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this section is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after modi@@ fying XML files , the menu must be selected from the Chart with Play@@ list and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the Edit Mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation of starting and loading can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ tain@@ able option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted simply . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation of the start does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; cur@@ ses ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L , supported by &amp; KM@@ Player . &quot;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the &amp; KM@@ Player configuration dialog ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
&quot; there is no tab for this playback in the &amp; KM@@ Player configuration dialog ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ player ; it can even embed the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist , XML . &quot;
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to start in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; so that a pre@@ determined back@@ end is always taken for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manually alter@@ ing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , ph@@ on@@ on should return all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play on TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the device can be used in the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data recor@@ ders ) settings in the KM@@ player , the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports for which one is selected . the enco@@ ding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; internally , various names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source . if enabled , start playing the playlist . &quot;
is there evidence how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play by it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom drives on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine only starts up slowly but why must my CPU be tested for its performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player takes the last stored value automatically , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile and compile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably rely on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compile and are included on the c@@ ile ; web page .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or if you want to compile and compile , please refer to the mailing list of K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn about its possibilities should the manual to Kate be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a lay@@ er@@ can ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; - mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; here is just a good super@@ visor to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book on it . to be able to master &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ Docum@@ class , the Cologne begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : this will determine the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; Newsletter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; proj@@ ectors &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; enco@@ ding : hereby the character enco@@ ding is set . it should use the character enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as default . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they have to be selected only in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Buch ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides - as well as other source editor - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; K@@ ile ; if you see larger areas of a gray text on the screen , it is with great probability that any mathematical environment is not closed . &quot;
the automatic completion of the environment is created by typ@@ ing a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line to the lie@@ uten@@ ant of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings file ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful when using a DVI ; file ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) &#93; , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the original output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing and converting to DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are ski@@ pped with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is cli@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; master document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set up project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
&quot; file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is connected to the &quot; &quot; super@@ imposed &quot; &quot; and is not a call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick @-@ construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large en selection fields should be found . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Other &quot; &quot; selection box is used to add items such as keywords , joints or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; description : with this command , a term for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection via a choice box ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¤ e is used for determining the font size . it can be specified the characters for the main text , the joints marks , etc . there are the following font sizes available : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two options are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses according to the command \ \ DVI class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font size . if the font size does not set at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the source code above is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen or Kn@@ op@@ f Schnell@@ bau . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; it performs the storage automatically .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size e 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font size . &quot;
the changes are only checked within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limitation ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , li@@ pos@@ ure , cur@@ sive , sub@@ missions etc. are added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } ital@@ ics .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments for the better legi@@ bility of the document should be performed . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the legi@@ bility of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screen screens . &quot;
&quot; for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion can begin in any other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preview allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern under Settings can set up ... Tools building needs to be selected . &quot;
&quot; in order to apply pre @-@ select search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on for pre @-@ select search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then carried out . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; K@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this must &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( Set@@ ting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; should a mistake occur when using quick @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI @-@ viewer , an error can be encountered . if there is an error , it is displayed in the log file or in the message panel . &quot;
&quot; the logging file er@@ ases the source code in source . in the editor , the sni@@ ff@@ lers from La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error in log file must be cli@@ cked and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once clicking on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard can be used for fast creation of a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be opened or a new file can be created . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template by means of a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings file ... Settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TS@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ DVI class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps have to be performed :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the default selected . &quot;
a template can be made from any lat@@ ex ; files will be created . will create a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and lifting from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in menu tools directly from &amp; K@@ ile ; published .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; ate ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual of Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called through the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; can be used as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed switching button , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex distingu@@ ishes itself ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color . &quot;
many wiz@@ ard can add additional spr@@ ing@@ marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text .
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent options have been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; supports always many environments and groups , and therefore supports the following commands for selecting text : &quot;
&quot; there is a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this expanded meaning is not meant to include tables , lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bow@@ ing thing in &amp; K@@ ile ; is that the contents are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains lat@@ ex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be flus@@ hed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the Description to Edi@@ ting Exec@@ ution paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for further orders under editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command you will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
when the cur@@ sor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , quick overview can be lost . this command complet@@ es the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by braces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those made from editing environment . &quot;
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ led bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing clamp .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is present before or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted groups cl@@ as@@ ps , quick overview can be lost . this command complet@@ es the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy @-@ to @-@ use labels are used as man@@ ners . the sign &quot; &quot; used for two simple guides is used . &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and applies two closing quotation marks for &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double control mark can set up using Pre@@ ferences K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
&quot; it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. , n@@ ave or french ) and thus German or French insignia . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; when using Shift ; En@@ ter En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only a line break but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , t &amp; K@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an ending line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . these can be created under settings K@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X is added .
&quot; some users want to assign columns in tables settings and thereby assign all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab@@ ulator in the above line . although this tab is not the corresponding tab , add a few gaps for the columns position of the current tabl@@ ature . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already providing a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , there are several modes available for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for different work@@ places under settings K@@ ile ... can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; when you start a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed , and by this means the complete list is opened . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by typ@@ ing another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions can be possible using the spr@@ ing@@ marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste spr@@ ing@@ flag and the selected parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; you can configure settings to these lists . there can be different serial lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as readers of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for completing environments . there is always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of completion mode will result in a large e list with environmental commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for completing the vic@@ ini@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; when calling the completion mode using the full @-@ piece setting , or the key @-@ key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the ambient execution can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once and K@@ ile ; recognize that it is a listing environment , even a first \ \ item command is included . &quot;
settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; you can make settings to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; supports user @-@ defined lists of extensions which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be executed . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , where the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor can be completed by editing , or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Emp@@ ty , the letter L is replaced by string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large outer boxes are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter are written more than once in a document . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the Men@@ Ã ¼ vom facility ... h@@ ile can be disabled . here , also the swelling value for the display of the completion can be specified . &quot;
&quot; the editing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Personal Home folder . this means abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
the dialog graphics form the inser@@ tion of graphics as easy as possible . to super@@ vise the fundament@@ als of the graphics formats the sections should be followed and noted .
&quot; PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is needed , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to examine the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the tools are group@@ ed together in the menus created comp@@ iling , comp@@ iling and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file and using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after the compile . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... In this case the following information is requested for the project :
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed via a vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods has : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete user manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; K@@ ile ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the quantity of documents with the &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database of all documents and documents and a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or phrases . von &amp; K@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or clicking the space button opens the viewer to the document .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be carried out on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; K@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; K@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; installed with OS X installed . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the continu@@ ance of the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ project asp@@ ire and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use while respecting the &amp; GNU ; License . &quot;

&quot; &amp; cr@@ acked ; is a graphical editor to manage many different sig@@ natures for emails . using the command line interface , you can create random sig@@ natures or sig@@ natures from a list . this command line interface provides sig@@ natures for external e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; cas@@ hier ; read out . by many sig@@ natures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day sig@@ natures , the same signature will be read from the signature file of &amp; sig for the whole day . for each day , use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures , create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you one cur@@ l ; empty signature ; and paste it with C@@ tr@@ l ; s file Save or click on the Disk icon save . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many sig@@ natures as you wish . then you have a list of sig@@ natures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough sig@@ natures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File Rem@@ ove menu or click on the icon with the red cross removing in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; open the Quick command dialog box . here you can select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user @-@ defined action at the bottom right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; cr@@ o ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 necessary . to attach Sig@@ natures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command . &quot;

&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . by doing so , the plug @-@ in system will benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the plug in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows to manage all included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to uniqu@@ ely identify .
one member can have several roles in the project such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can look for himself from the list of members of the team who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ty@@ ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s identity are important with regard to news and notes . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later you can see how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that takes a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Dialog@@ es events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the recipients selected in the add@@ res@@ see list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in how such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note it is simple . you can either select the Not@@ ebook entry from the editor contex@@ tual menu or enter the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word in a comment section followed by comment text .
&quot; note can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where Nick@@ name of the assigned nickname of the team member is , is a role in the project . &quot;
nickname and roll names are independent of b@@ ump@@ y caps but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found . &quot;
settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over a few pages that are being treated one after another .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in terms of tags , including auto@@ complete , can be changed with this . entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / small letters of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal Groß / P@@ lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal upper / lower case means , the attributes are inserted as described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; tags automatically close : if attached , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; start and finish day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . re@@ stores the default values by using the Def@@ ault button .
default character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or in another way than with File Open opened files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here is pushed by the same into the project properties in case a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the DT@@ D selected is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash when next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view ( or documentation in a tab@@ by ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset window settings to the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through by changing M@@ DI modes and do@@ o@@ cks / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks from no longer ques@@ tioning .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; the structure tree settings can be adjusted to the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are group@@ ed into groups , each can be divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ config short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are K@@ part applications from third side , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load component in &quot; Read Only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses the loading . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the input is correct . pick the entry when the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re@@ developed . the support for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin concept was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations of plug @-@ ins . &quot;
currently only one plug @-@ in is available ; support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; includes .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in selection box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us UI : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with time numbers and conditions are listed . normally appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plugin with to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that needs a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that it doesn &apos;t have to pay attention to it normally . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . output of this request will be shown in the view de@@ bu@@ gger output .
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information on the variables monitored and the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution will continue . if this happens while the script is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a request is requested , the execution starts as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , whereby , if possible , in functions and include it is correctly adjusted . &quot;

this chapter describes how to customize and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how to help you to become better .
&quot; document Type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for market and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; you enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; its simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag Fol@@ ders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types , the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions can be inserted more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and even tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog ; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a type@@ writer .
&quot; tag files are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if it is necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is presented in a simple manner .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type . &quot;
the type of the tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 )
valid only for day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has an common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains other tags to describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source texts used for filling in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a editing and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each character ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each one ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of items ending a day . this element is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , its simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check is performed only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
in the following example for a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the schema &gt; element of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; Over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; \ &quot; &quot; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &quot;
&quot; the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D , DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; it should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = change 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings Ac@@ tions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cut is assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action this text is inserted in the document by the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will replace the current document with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the default input . in the input field input , you can determine what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; there are two ways output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , written to the standard output format . it can be specified what is to be done with the output written to the default output , by setting the value in the output field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Options . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes and you plan the use , enable dialog &quot; Edit day &quot; when available , so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; download &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size rest . &quot;
&quot; please note that this created symbol will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green it mostly appears as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will be inserted ; Start ; -@@ Tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be associated with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to tool@@ bar or you should set them to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar setting dialog over settings tool@@ bars . make sure the required tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick access to the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by sample of all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; backup to the right folder . after new@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( s ) to load ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most desirable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ Language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; func@@ tion@@ .@@ html Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ tion@@ 1 , func@@ 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html tag 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but look &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources files will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used for designing the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . by marking the function name and pressing of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
you can now save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation is used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else who are sent . there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with enam@@ el , tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archives , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields have to be filled out ( URL @-@ preview can be empty ) and start clicking OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ates and Script tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature . in case of problems it warns and it can be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message will appear with the specification of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files in tag XML format might be necessary . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ line : the string that should appear in ! Doc@@ type Tag such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are stored for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only be used by this user .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the project folder tree , which allows the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the cards with information and the tool@@ bar . please suggest in , and for more information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab@@ by with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching , such as closing the current , other or all the tab@@ s , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or exec@@ uting CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tag in the mouse poin@@ ter , or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
at the top of the editor window the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , click the icon that represents the tag . &quot;
&quot; the building man@@ si@@ ties ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to open and ro@@ am through . in the presentation with a map operator stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , whole website &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the appropriate user and templates in projects only in the project . more templates are available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available for a script . &quot;
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right clicking on an element opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ ly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system aligned to the content allows the modification of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by addition a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and considered project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab@@ by shows information about each running script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown . &quot;
&quot; this tab@@ by shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar by email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive to &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load ! &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; its . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework , it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted action , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development , and has quickly become a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers abandoned the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is running help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ old Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , it converts any special characters to &amp; HTML , so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day . &quot;
switches on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are out !
select a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message box or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
training and activation of the problem repor@@ ter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set Book@@ marks with a single click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents are group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .

presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . that allows , for example , to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details explained . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in reposit@@ ories / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved using actions actions . tool@@ bars are saved using tool tool@@ bars or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
&quot; if you have not saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
with this you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; enables high loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
download a DT@@ D ; which you or someone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description .
&quot; load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu , containing the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar refuse when this day is contrary to the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu items listed above . click on it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in will de@@ activate it . &quot;
select syntax mode for the current file . the list of available options depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes takes time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . when selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
&quot; direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; c@@ ate , you can find details . &quot;
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which can add and modify the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help in the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as for example , after filling out the project name , the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.@@ g f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ex@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the chosen protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web@@ in@@ content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started anew , not hooks . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to good di@@ lu@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub@@ window profiles or be changed using the Shift ; F@@ 7 short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in detail . additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ cards possible ) , which are re @-@ read in for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this way you can select the de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; Up@@ load profiles upload high loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by showing its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; events actions can be switched on in the event configuration and add , change or delete event actions . event operations are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as the viewing of a file . see the details . &quot;
by default open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened .
to open a different project choose project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes prior to leaving , if you want to save changes before leaving . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folder beha@@ ves as well but lacks the entries opening and opening ... with the right mouse button on the pop @-@ up context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button is blind@@ ed to prevent removing . &quot;
&quot; the password will be kept in the main memory and forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading files is necessary , and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk cache option does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this must not be changed unless the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted from the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best configur@@ able via the menu Tool@@ bar . use and Ad@@ ding differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the Ad@@ dition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either using contex@@ tual menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , a New tool@@ bar can be removed , Tool@@ bar changes can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set up actions ..
&quot; templates are essentially a document skel@@ eton , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates are basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you set up for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary forms are usually included in documents by links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . further information on the template tree is available .
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents , based on a template , but the same text area . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire web sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure as you wish ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As a template save as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File Add as template save option as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop on the template Templ@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or inser@@ ting over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project file tree view , you can choose a folder on the right and create a site template , enter a name for the template and secure . by default it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented manner . you can pre@@ define head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
template structure in sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder in the Template tab , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template list . if a root folder is set , it would basically disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( shown to press right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second sub@@ divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back when needed to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing the PHP source , a small green symbol shows the default of the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; source code . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation interval between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small chip for fast calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows you to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . changing CSS rules is still not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button , selecting the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the cur@@ sors use the cur@@ sor as in a word processor , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded with text , needs to be removed by any other ar@@ mature day . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled . later , they will work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be pursued . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to compile successfully , need except for &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode you can set the sp@@ awn points in a specific file and line number and later be activated .
&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top@@ most file style file named con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style sheet file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a template named QNAP or a specified model name is verified . &amp; eg ; template matches any my@@ ME that contains the template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is added to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stopping points will be re @-@ checked again shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later there were added any number of additional useful features .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently from each other in one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time allows you to edit the results directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps when comparing and mer@@ ging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; empty Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@ der _ Fol@@
&quot; opening dialog allows manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; select folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , B and C will be a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A to the other folders . &quot;
&quot; if coll@@ isions are enabled , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not essential to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you don &apos;t need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
&quot; what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ very info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed over the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , you can see the color which differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well to see . &quot;
&quot; in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are not relevant only in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the abstr@@ action column from the text is interrupted in places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is scored points on re@@ fr@@ actu@@ red lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the header output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next dissolved / un@@ solved conflict to find remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the abstr@@ action column in one of the windows , the group will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; this text does not appear in the text &amp; lt ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources to ignore the options or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , up , side down , side down , start , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the abstr@@ acts synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained earlier in the section together and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Insert ) . &quot;
&quot; new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors do not use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use Wagen@@ Back + Time feed \ \ r \ . &quot;
the options and the list of files that are last used will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start . ( setting Settings - &gt; C@@ ure 3 ... )
&quot; choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered in@@ ert . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically introduces an un@@ controlled color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted at pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line is automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying manually into the clip@@ board then drops . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , you try to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step is ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a cart back mark &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot;
this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . see for details under documentation on directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ original . if there is already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to quit and restart it so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is set globally over the control center . )
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; on the enco@@ ding fields for the enco@@ ding , a brief indication of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
switch this to supp@@ ress her@@ bi@@ ds of changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you might want only see the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply send out the less important windows . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison windows side by side or above each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files . a simple click starts assem@@ bling and uses the file name of the last source file as default names for output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed on to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut out distur@@ bing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed on to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which exactly meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line breaks to convert entry in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; That . * is a weigh@@ ty expression that matches the found text in the first cl@@ am couple . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) .
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line devi@@ ations@@ . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ very sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , i.e. quasi deleted . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform multiple replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
&quot; instead sed , you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and mer@@ ging , and subsequent operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor statements are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may acci@@ dentally do not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge the entire folder recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before starting
... can simul@@ ate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it
... &quot; performs selective actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the Dialog File .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be able to keep a small news window over current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that time . &quot;
&quot; if the scanning of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
every file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually represented together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions All sub@@ directories , and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ clicking on a file , the file comparison will start and a comparison window will appear . &quot;
the icon in the column Name mirrors the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically chosen . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black are used . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , red becomes . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist the merge cannot be started .
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and if the option Directory is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to restore both folders will be identical . &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and the option New file is selected instead of merge ( unsure ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and hits the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; when assem@@ bling , one file will work after the other . it status column shows Fer@@ tig when the merge was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge operation is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file comparison method is selected for full @-@ time analysis in the setup dialog , it will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is only shown if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode C will be used as a target , and B and / or B will be used as a target when synchron@@ izing A and / or B . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the Fol@@ der menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to add only the current item : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contradic@@ tory file types still invalid merge actions exist , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options &quot; &quot; Run &quot; , &quot; Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el . &quot;
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without making any changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( together with a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are done with a file , select again to start / continue the directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , then a corresponding dialog appears . then proceed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were merged in an individual way , see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be completed . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called Directory Alig@@ n@@ ment with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; the default wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders do not have to correspond to this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . there can be more than one pattern input , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . there can be more than one pattern input , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ ing files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a hide attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous point marks a file than hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; links to folders : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders across a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . &quot;
&quot; similar to that of the modification date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . it can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
activ@@ ates synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode the proposals for merge files will be stored in both folders . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merge the copy of the newer file as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe , because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension , this will also affect the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch off the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views using change between the folder &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you can also directly merge a file directly using a double @-@ click . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly from the merge menu . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : new Entry &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an on an ft@@ p server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , id@@ l@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be differentiated if a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modi@@ fying date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Trust of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP initially always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ user view from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a Part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will start to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ user . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports compar@@ isons between two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in Part mode . &quot;
&quot; there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ are ) . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I used the GPL software for quite a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this road or go it like that .
&quot; you have compiled the program from sources and probably did not tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will appear as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the attribute this is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; you can always use a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ understood , please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you shouldn &apos;t have any problems with comp@@ iling . if there are any difficulties , please refer to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed , showing differences . this also means that identical files will not be copied into the destination folder when mer@@ ging . ( behavior is likely altered in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . differences in character ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or move them . this works within a working area as well as several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible in both a working area and on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty background from &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only displays the two entries P@@ ager . the icon and the name of the application , as well as the entries , minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and loading . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is ti@@ cked , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is shown together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ al numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; box ; otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
&quot; here the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally allows &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , it shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical position in a vertical line , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their content . besides , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and set the selection of swit@@ chers ... allowing the dialog to appear .
&quot; currently , this can not be changed in the settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ z. If you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log into root or contact your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for using &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . the image that appears in the magni@@ fier pane is an enlarged area of the screen , and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
in the default setting it increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile micro@@ scope . alternatively you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to illustrate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fier window ( selection window mode ) or the surrounding of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . please note , that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not yet able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the window display mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier . this also goes along with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition , press the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain fixed and only move the lower right corner . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops updating of the ad . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refres@@ h rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode there will be a selection window . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and smaller &amp; etc ; . &quot;
you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( enter either this URL in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or address bar ; one or run k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&quot; &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick , as soon as the cur@@ sor res@@ ides for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and cause any mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; it is intended to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick is causing pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; if you are suffering pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clearer : even if &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain that helps when clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click away as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement briefly .
&quot; the smart move is activated , makes &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it em@@ ulates pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . &quot;
this dwell time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ester ; a mouse click .
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent Mov@@ ing is enabled , the shooting time is switched ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wa@@ its before it leaves the mouse button again , if there is no need for the mouse . &quot;
&quot; this movement is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ c@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt even if the first time is started , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times . &quot;
this option is selected and km@@ ester ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically .
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pushed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing by App@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; it is best to use &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with default settings . in particular , the smart move should first be switched off . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should make aware of which positions a mou@@ sec@@ lick is left without any action : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can use the mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scr@@ ape with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started an im@@ position , this means that &amp; km@@ ester ; the operation can no longer be left by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you do a mouse click on it . this will reset the status of &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible in this way to select text , copy it to clip@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it . instead mark text as follows : press the Shift key at the end of the text area , and press the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . this creates a sound like a mouse click , so you know exactly when the shifting time starts when the smart move is moving . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . that should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and they are correctly set up .
&quot; this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome , and the operation of the mouse buttons is painful . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to speak their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of sentences , which are to be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text passages . from the text passages you can often choose the text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you determine the dictionary for word @-@ to @-@ word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the language chosen to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only properly scrip@@ ting words can be added to the word supplement . &quot;
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clear and essentially includes a input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a delay memory of the already spoken sentences ( the top white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have mouth ; correctly set , you can enter the sentences in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; mouth ; this dialog contains two map cards , speech output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ transi@@ tions as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card pass , you will enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , set the character enco@@ ding , with the text to be passed to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is unchanged as default input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to speech output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if that is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the t@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for speech output , and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text passages , or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of In @-@ In speaking , the selected text passage is directly spoken and inserted in addition to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of into the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box closing of the edit window for text passages , you can specify if the text format is to be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you select changes , the text format is not saved . select Before Save , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text format is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ vention page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word supplement . in the main window next to the input field , see &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box indicates , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the language ; the frequency of the individual words is simply calculated by counting the assignment . additionally , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are presented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you selected a text passages , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either using the selection in the tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the repository . &quot;
&quot; the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the repository . &quot;
&quot; the currently active phrase is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise select the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation repository . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; shown , if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sli@@ dable bar for text fitting books is displayed with entries . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you will probably have the command for speech output not correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth , set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the map output . ( see Settings dialog for Synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the optional data must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax would like to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be turned on as default input .
&quot; the Voice Output D@@ äm@@ on von &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice @-@ over@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is performed only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use t@@ ts@@ d as the language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; setting . &quot;
&quot; to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends in detail on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can leave text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always make new editions again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer needs to be installed on the computer .
you can find detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice @-@ output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of the modules of existing service , which allows every application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) , it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers are ready to use their applications with T@@ TS abilities . &quot;
&quot; reading text ( or parts of it ) in the text editor , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; box ; applications embedded . &quot;
&quot; speech output is done via the speech speech disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , etc . &quot;
enables the creation of language editions on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; support program .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; speech service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browsers &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts of it .
a module for the text editor ( text editor ) ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about accessibility ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . subscribe to the list via https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . &quot;
before you can use it you need to install and configure program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
&quot; when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the map card will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map card is shown General . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use , because the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer drivers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card @-@ leading speaker at kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card board will be displayed . this also appears automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to move the speaker to the list below . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
&quot; select a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and gir@@ ly voice . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker appears on the map speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; t@@ ts ; almost always use . go back to map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; use to create and manage text assignments . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card leader General to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to activate the &amp; t@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can make text orders and read the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the field &apos;s voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the control panel in the control panel , dis@@ appears again as soon as the reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row , you can start , stop , stop and res@@ ume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card leader General and check out Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ops . then check the text that is to be read , and select the main menu Tools text . after a short time the speech output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ops . then check the text that is to be read , and then select the text output to start . then the speech output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other applications it is embedded , like &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , noti@@ fying you of the events you have set up . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up a message , for example , to notify you when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ats ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before being sent to the speech speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , to choose the right language and speaker , or to avoid certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &apos; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &apos; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the received orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the output of the warning .
&quot; messages have the highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you have a lengthy text on a web page , you can say with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who enters the room just steps . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also news . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any order you initiate from the map card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the issue of screen reproduction . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , during &amp; kt@@ ats ; just one such reading , this output is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ agents . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
&quot; character enco@@ der substitute parts of a text by other text . the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; is provided with pre@@ defined string inser@@ tion filters , which facilitate the creation of chat @-@ em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for the translation of &amp; XHTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not checked and is not used . filters are removed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns for the set @-@ up of string inser@@ tions . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding sub@@ stitution text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you can get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must leave you away . if for example , and q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you are allowed to enter only copies . &quot;
&quot; the string inser@@ tion filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box slide filter apply when it matches . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by separating characters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package u@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
XML ; XML ; trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such implement@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the Spe@@ aker Selection filter , you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; the speaker is selected by the speaker features , which the program pre@@ prints , which sends the text to &amp; fr@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speaker designed on the card board . with the speaker selecting filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can use it by clicking on the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; set the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the requested requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your chat settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box slide filter apply if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .

&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Converter filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , that SA@@ B@@ LE does not work at all . you also need to do that if you do not use this voice to read websites . also , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found on the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that entire pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or just gi@@ b@@ bin . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the option character enco@@ ding is set to the correct language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string inser@@ tion filter . see . &quot;

&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ons ; from the source code for k@@ de@@ manu@@ als or download the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before using , check first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back to sentence or paragraph , repeat the output , or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if you have an application text to &amp; kt@@ ops , you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is feminine , it will be automatically chosen by the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ats ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click &apos; Add &apos; on the map card , and in order to insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the card card is displayed . for example , the setup of the module for festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found here . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text handed to the festival . if votes , the &amp; kt@@ ops are known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider , you set lou@@ dness , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controls and display this gray , the voice selected by you does not reveal these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater memory usage ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or simply click on App@@ ly ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to see the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr still does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all the jobs listed in the queue , along with the application that set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the precisely edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card board speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can proceed or go backwards in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other map cards ) are taken over and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; there are only text entries listed and managed here . editions of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops , see . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled , either without support for the corresponding audio module or re@@ fr@@ actions ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speech speed here . € 50@@ 0.00 , roughly corresponds to half and 200@@ 0.1 ; % about the double normal session rate . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules , which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . &quot;
&quot; on this map you can set up specific actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of language assignments : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn from all other orders and stops these orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the received orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next higher priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot reserved . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can say with &amp; mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen re@@ inde@@ er , adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played if a normal text order is interrupted . if both the conduc@@ tive sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card pass only apply to normal text orders . for messages , al@@ erts and the editions of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ats ; noti@@ fy noti@@ fy messages , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card noti@@ fications will appear . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; dis@@ connect . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ats ; do not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , al@@ erts to which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete them . when you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when somebody men@@ tions your nickname in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this sel@@ ector box to specify what to do , if an event occurs . you have the following choices : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown on the list on the map speaker as the top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the Event All Noti@@ fications for Application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button load to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , voice speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also , SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ons ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations exist :
&quot; you have to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , as this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and movement bor@@ der@@ line recognition filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this allows you to start or stop writing assignments , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you see the set limits recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , a set limits recognition filter is automatically set up as a default . however , you can change its settings or add further sets of limits , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the Spe@@ aker &apos;s selection by ex@@ iting . switch to the Spe@@ aker selection and select text to read . to do so , change the Spe@@ aker &apos;s selection and check how the speaker &apos;s selection is changed . you must naturally have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; the first sentence is to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the map card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this feature . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set limits recognition filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
border identi@@ fier filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set limits . note that the standard set limits recognition filter keeps the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( kos@@ her ) , al@@ erts , messages , or the issue of screen re@@ agents . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal limits recognition filter from default , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; box . &quot;
you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the card pass . the map card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card spokes@@ man ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which displays all the features of a set speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; t@@ ts ; this speaker is selected . otherwise , select &amp; t@@ ts ; the speaker that is closest to the originally set @-@ up properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired language properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the chosen speaker . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
tick this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a prime feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all the properties in the area of speakers , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker type button and then use the Spe@@ aker , which matches the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last text order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer has crashed and hit . you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . you may have to install G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x if the problem is not resolved , it is possible to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , freeze &amp; t@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with AL@@ SA can occur , which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ent / voices , add the new voice . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the URL where you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; in order for this to work , the program must be installed and be found via the PAT@@ H environment variable . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card board for speaker setup . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads . ( this is because HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courage@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courage@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML converter filter , and set the recording speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t create websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that the festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file thro@@ ws the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags to convert SS@@ ML . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a dedicated string sub@@ stitution filter and now I can in &amp; box ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the card leader orders are displayed , the order exists only from one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter to set limits for these characters instead . &quot;
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
note : please make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ops . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start reading a text . &quot;
&quot; with July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still doesn &apos;t support any real breaks . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded as tar@@ ball ( tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . go to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts is probably removed or created at least only on request .
&quot; the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . the configure option to disable the creation shows the configure parameter , which causes the transition of the creation . &quot;
&quot; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 is installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS environment variable , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target as an option . &quot;

&quot; before you use the synthes@@ izer , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is disclosed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you will need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to write to the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 bit ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look for festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files .
&quot; in this process additional wr@@ apper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Vo@@ ices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the inser@@ tion of the error correc@@ tions is not necessary , you just need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ew@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; ( voice location &quot; &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; ( voice location &quot; &quot; german _ de@@ 2 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you need to edit / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;

&quot; EP@@ OS is a free speech synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple language synthes@@ izer with sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ats , you can only set the volume in this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the map speaker , click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ OS language syn@@ ths . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map speaker . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; ep@@ os -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor voice speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ em ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a console . &quot;
it is best to use a command that writes voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows managing network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by choosing K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by choosing k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers are used for network hardware and other devices when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded , if the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best meets the distribution and release level . by marking the setting not @-@ again queries , the definition can be taken permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . before all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , change is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders : &quot;
the Ri@@ der Network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces you can perform the following tasks :
configur@@ able network interfaces can be set up by selecting the device you want to set up in the list and click the button ... Set@@ ting up the device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Autom@@ atically , TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time with the startup of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , so no further setup is required . in the selection list either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected . &quot;
&quot; with the option Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be checked . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as characteristics of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off as needed . switch off a switched network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as needed . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
&quot; establishes the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if more than one network interface is present on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain attack by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers only can understand IP addresses . if the machine is requested http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS releases this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the machine for nam@@ ing up part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group machine to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... Edit the Edit dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list name calcul@@ ator describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily during bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list includes known calcul@@ ators some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP is still to be replaced in future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a name known from the list and select Edit .... Edit the Conver@@ t machine will appear .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will refres@@ h the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical user interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and others . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technique is given ; in the second section , all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be convey@@ ed . &quot;
IP networks are currently running with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is to be as@@ cer@@ tained . in foreign networks , on the eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person who has a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a special reserved area for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore its use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ f.@@ e. .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is allocated to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
in this section are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , there is another content as defined there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is re @-@ sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs according to a timet@@ able in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system utility cr@@ on .
&quot; when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of already set tasks and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . each folder can be opened up and closed . &quot;
&quot; with a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not displayed and under description will be disabled . &quot;
the environment variables appearing here set apart the otherwise existing environment variables for all specified tasks except force . in a de@@ activated variable it is de@@ activated as a description .
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks folder . then go to Edit New ... altern@@ ativ@@ . you can also right click on the tasks folder and click on the pop @-@ up context menu New ... Select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the program to start . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press Select .... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; when you specify both day and day ( s ) as well as day of day ( s ) , the program will be performed at a suitable date as well as on a suitable day of the week . for example , when you select the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be carried out on the 1st and 15th of the months , regardless of the date of the week . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes are only active when the cr@@ on@@ tab has been stored . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to be removed . then go to edit Cut . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select output , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;

&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; train the band back and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the band . disc@@ erns &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ader on the tape do not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; detect &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ader , search for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol changed for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched through the end of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before casting a tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; the band can now be released without danger , by changing the symbol for the tape , that the band &apos;s involvement has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . &quot;
&quot; before a band from &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; tape types must be form@@ atted before you can use data to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive does not require format@@ ting , it must happen before you form@@ atted from the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives do not require format@@ ting of the tape , DAT drives do not require format@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capac@@ itance drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the strap , all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
&quot; once the backup is started , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including data rate and time remaining . &quot;
select a file or folder in any of the archives associated with the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
mark the files in one of the archives for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in any of the archives and select the menu item to check ....
&quot; once the scan is started , the dialog box will appear for review . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for checking . &quot;
the dialog will display the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
&quot; before you can initiate re@@ building , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in any of the archives that belong to the record for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from any of the archives using a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog will display settings for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will pop up . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the band content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two types of the band :
this creates a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files located in the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , can be stored separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the full path to device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape recorder .
&quot; this setting is active , sent &amp; k@@ dat ; before the volume is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; is the option turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ector in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the band is automatically ej@@ ected ; automatically disc@@ ard the tape . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy drivers . &quot;
&quot; the option turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ containing block size for the tape drive change . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to notify the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted a tape , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only contain one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , whereby host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the band was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat folder .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with the GNU ; tar tar . even other tar @-@ versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , the system allows users quick access , for example , information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files .
&quot; moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and analysed by using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shots , see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , you try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criteria or according to entered string . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will be displayed . then a log line will only be displayed , if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a different entry at this point . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the process of the process , and then enter the name of a process in the protocol file system , thus showing you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines sent or generated by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log lines of the level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color than minutes of the level indicator . the color display of minutes lines can be switched off set @-@ up dialog .
&quot; if you only want to display a particular process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the startup of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter@@ Strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can turn the option to new lines in the main window pop @-@ up menu to display all the new addition minutes . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage this feature . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log message from the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. Please find more information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;

&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it quickly develops to the standard for controlling program start at startup of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is located under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important , because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ forming . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc , directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d .
the kernel searches in various places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you want to change the in@@ it@@ tab file . if you want to change it , then you will be able to fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually launch these scripts manually from the command line :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only htt@@ p@@ d , etc . , network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not tell tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move the scripts between running level@@ s or move the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . this only happens if it removes an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new space . to only copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and add them to the target area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore records thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Available systems services , run@@ level 1 Start , run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sorting number or name of an entry , press the input button to switch the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ s- , and now the machine is rest@@ art@@ ed . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution at run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE , or Del@@ ay ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services in these distri@@ butions are launched , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation relates to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user . &quot;
&quot; after you have made any changes , you need to save them . either you can use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two map cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled wild@@ cards ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card map will be created , in case of shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the map card password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD -@@ uni@@ xes . &quot;
this map card only appears if there is space limitation ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) if for at least one @-@ time file system ( quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
