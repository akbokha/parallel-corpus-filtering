<seg id="14">"the peculiarity of & FSView; consists of showing indexed folder hierarchies using a so-called Tree map. tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportionate to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. thus, it can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the database description represents a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, rectangles have useful color gebanding and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or representation of another file properties such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can determine if it is at all displayed, only when sufficient space for representation is present, or whether the area of subordinate rectangle may be used (whereby, consequently, representation errors may be set by constraints in the symbol of the Cornwall). in addition, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"settings algorithms for Treemaps should be observed as a rule, that the area is proportional to the size of the entry."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how to split the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for inscription and avoidance of space losses due to frame always advantageous the areas to emerge that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns, or recurrent branches."</seg>

<seg id="299">"with the setting lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning."</seg>
<seg id="300">"in earlier versions of & digitised, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is quickly becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing."</seg>
<seg id="301">"the default assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the scanned green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitively to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method."</seg>
<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">"this setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance, photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight."</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the default is the pointed lights, so the parts of your pictures are burned in, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as a penetrating white. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights."</seg>
<seg id="306">"this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & digitides; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want."</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you choose to reconstruct the option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture."</seg>
<seg id="308">"put the Luminance value to your taste. you probably need to put it a little higher than the standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digious; image processing. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing in small, you should be conservative."</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color-construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">"and Dcraw provides you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation."</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come a predictable variance from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">"when the theme is on colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results they want. unfortunately, colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about colour management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">"your only other image issues are by e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard."</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone, why should you use a different colour space and make thoughts about color management?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, then visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent page and click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"if you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to callify your monitor because sRGB assumes that your onitor is installed on sRGB, then you must either callify your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalizing, Comparison, Automatic Compare and Contrast Extends from the menu Correcise Automatical Correction automatically try to make the best out of your colors. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see what works best with your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminous values over the whole picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"same: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same amount of brightness reaches the same number of pixels. sometimes the same is very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic Comparison: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Add contrast: this method enhances the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest possible area and a rejiuscation of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digitides; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is a little limited since the color space is 8-bit per colour. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, then it's enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">Thumbnail preview features a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"right above, a histogram shows that dynamically changes once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dim also."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you set can save you in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button deletes all filtervalues back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted by the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digious; tool color effects provide four color effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar isation, also called sabatier, was an effect of the additional light. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photopaper of the additional light. the result was a partial negative image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar radiation. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and this is edited (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it beautifies many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an altered colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. with large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">"digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not uncommon to change the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied."</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can be a good choice for saturation rather than raising them. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on tone correction for the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide. concrete the three slides below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right you can see the original and preview of the picture. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the picture. on the left side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box you can adjust whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic y-axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones, often called gammavalues."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pintes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">"output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to create the output values interactively as in the input values. the compression of the output values can be used, for example, to create a bleached image as background while something else is in the foreground."</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this knob, the image values are automatically placed depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons the values stored in the filesystem can be saved and later recharged. to do so the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">"when using this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left hand side, half of the original and the target image are displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">More modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images photographed with a digital camera, linear mode causes a wide bar. in this case logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a curvepiece to the right e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker output tones and that become darker with the corresponding image pixels."</seg>
<seg id="436">"preview the original photos is a red marker to see. if you move this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve showing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve generated by you can be saved in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp cam format.</seg>
<seg id="438">"activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve."</seg>
<seg id="439">"the overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if you are found in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result."</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo which was corrected in the Luminate channel. shadow and sun tones have been set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digibox; editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer from Editing Editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image features a red marker. if you position it in the picture a vertical line in the histogram will show you the corresponding color value.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitised; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was taken from Gimp and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improved the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus and most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitization process colours with only minimal differences to a colon. elements that are smaller than the resolution are thus to be combined to a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more afterward sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in the raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners already use a sharpening filter during reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening movement."</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but increases the sharpness of the edges. in general, the most useful technique for sharpness of an image will refocus the tool. you can refocus it using the menu entry Correct. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little bit softly is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry basket softens and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. increasing the radius or the amount increase the effect. if you make the sharpness mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates are generated close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius defines how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution pictures allow larger radii. therefore you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masculine filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; mould refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Designed Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a sharpness mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, circular folding works much better than the Gauß-Fitting. the Gauß Plateau has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixelae that are far from the original source pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should yield 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness Gauß is. this is most commonly caused by a previously executed un-sharpened filter. in most cases, you should use this parameter to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circle-shaped sharpness or the palate's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set is stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but the later unpleasant artifacts left behind."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurring measurers produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurring a larger neighborhood as sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, blur masks must always generate artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear Filter. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in handling small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, applied on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear Colour picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpening in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>

<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail husbandry p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the image."</seg>
<seg id="520">"action dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes equally in all directions while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD noise will produce a high value undulating pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness factor above all. p defines the relative smoothness. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. normally ranges from 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle progressions [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the More of quality you get by selecting this option is only minor, but it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to leave it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a unique black artefact in the foreground that is caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance between the filter to the front. if it is increased, noise tips will be cleared. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication appears again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong you can not remove the whole noise or smoke peaks may occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerant of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the thickness tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically mapped. however, it also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjustment of phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts on variations of luminance. when it is elevated, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges. it can remove noise and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters to reduce the noise you set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little bit softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpens. use tool to soften softer with the menu entry basket softens and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious; Photo restoration is definitely one of the furthest developed tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove the palate's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local mistakes that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images."</seg>

<seg id="561">"average: it is determined an average of the adjacent pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixel in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubical surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block."</seg>

<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction diminishes the luminosity of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only have to increase the settings."</seg>

<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden mean is a dividing that is based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussels or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks, which used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>

<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer to achieving good results for your photos. compared to the third-rule the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition results the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles also derive from the above-mentioned golden spiral. its vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to place on these lines can leave a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal and Vertical options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the color button you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines in your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it easily happens that you keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digitised; edit image processing and tool free rotation. select transformer free rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider Angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right.</seg>

<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF, or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">"first, select the RAW file to be converted and launch the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further process the picture later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"the Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you intend to process your pictures frequently or later on, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Output button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, if you are safe, for example by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite the existing file. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt."</seg>

<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels, which are followed individually and will be checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you turn on jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflexion computes. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and auto-stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information collected manually or fetched by the program automatically from freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator, and the encoder program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs, which information can be downloaded, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is important to note that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is no more or less valuable information, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted."</seg>

<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used, searching in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this has not been done yet."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"on the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the encoder can be used.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and read work on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>

<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keyword (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"cdparanoia and lame must already be installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine as it is not fully free software."</seg>

<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequentially at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>

<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else who are sent. there is an email-sending menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with enamel, tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded to our main archives, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download them."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you are asked for your passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource, the input fields have to be filled out (URL-preview can be empty) and start clicking OK to start uploading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploading from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature. in case of problems it warns and it can be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message will appear with the specification of the source of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files in tag XML format might be necessary. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically."</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>

<seg id="2081">"in & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand and take full advantage of & quantaplus, you must first familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;"</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are stored for everyone, the & quantaplus; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only be used by this user.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the project folder tree, which allows the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the cards with information and the toolbar. please suggest in, and for more information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the tabby with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching, such as closing the current, other or all the tabs, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tag in the mouse pointer, or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer."</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window the toolbars of the editor are located. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as default for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>

<seg id="2092">"project management is a powerful tool that provides and quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, whole website & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the appropriate user and templates in projects only in the project. more templates are available."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"here you can find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available for a script."</seg>

<seg id="2197">"templates are essentially a document skeleton, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; templates are basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you set up for the filesystem."</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary forms are usually included in documents by links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. further information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">"documents can be written by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents, based on a template, but the same text area. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree."</seg>
<seg id="2202">"as the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire web sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2203">"create a document structure as you wish (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As a template save as a local template...."</seg>

<seg id="2205">"select text in your document and click File Add as template save option as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop on the template Templates."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"creating binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and drop or inserting over the Konqueror file tree."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"in the file tree or in the project file tree view, you can choose a folder on the right and create a site template, enter a name for the template and secure. by default it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template."</seg>
<seg id="2208">"project templates allow a very goal-oriented manner. you can predefine headlines and footers, or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2209">Template structure in subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"to set the behavior of a folder in the Template tab, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:"</seg>
<seg id="2211">"a selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates."</seg>
<seg id="2212">"this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template list. if a root folder is set, it would basically disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a root folder."</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with matching headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">"in addition, you have a context menu (shown to press right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor through the VPL; editor and the second subdivides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back when needed to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; editor on a document containing the PHP source, a small green symbol shows the default of the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly using the VPL; source code. there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"the second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor, and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is already active, pressing the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"the synchronisation interval between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small chip for fast calculator and a large span for slow."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"the document properties dialog is also called, as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this allows you to change the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column. "</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. changing CSS rules is still not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button, selecting the appropriate file."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the cursors use the cursor as in a word processor, by moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"inserting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it is important to note that inserting tags before already existing identical tags will not be removed, e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded with text, needs to be removed by any other armature day."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"some toolbars such as the tables assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled. later, they will work in the & VPL; in this release the tables or lists of toolbars must be used."</seg>

<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a little nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later there were added any number of additional useful features.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently from each other in one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time allows you to edit the results directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps when comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merging:</seg>

<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window.</seg>

<seg id="2622">"to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program 'speech-dispatcher' works with a text. & ktops; distinguishes four types of texts."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is withdrawn from all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the received orders are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is too hot reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">"messages have the highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you have a lengthy text on a web page, you can say with & kmouth; someone who enters the room just steps. & kde; messages are also news. read about it."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text orders. any order you initiate from the map card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts, which do not have any special urgency."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"all four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the issue of screen reproduction. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, during & ktats; just one such reading, this output is stopped and finished."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reagents. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"character encoder substitute parts of a text by other text. the parts to replace can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; is provided with predefined string insertion filters, which facilitate the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form."</seg>

<seg id="2633">"for example, if you have set a female voice on the card speaker, you can read text from KDE news about it. read about it."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"when a text order, message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktops; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2915">"before you can initiate rebuilding, the files that are to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:"</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in any of the archives that belong to the record for the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from any of the archives using a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">"once the restore process has been started, the dialog will display settings for recovery. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"if you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog will pop up. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time."</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index in two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"for all folders that are listed under backup files, only the files located in the same filesystem, such as the folder. folders located on other filesystems, can be stored separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then."</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the KDat menu... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape recorder.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, sent & kdat; before the volume is integrated, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2932">"is the option turned on, tries & kdat; to lock the ejector in the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"if the option is turned on, the band is automatically ejected; automatically discard the tape. do not use this option with floppy drivers."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"the option turned on, tries & kdat; the hardware-containing block size for the tape drive change. not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to notify the block size for your tape drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"if & kdat; formatted a tape, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only contain one memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2936">"the format of this string is hostname: seconds, whereby hostname is the complete name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time when the band was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with the GNU; tar tar. even other tar-versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system provides the different protocol files. in addition, the system allows users quick access, for example, information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and analysed by using the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshots, see & ksystemlog; functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol-lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, you try & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criteria or according to entered string. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter will be displayed. then a log line will only be displayed, if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select a different entry at this point. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the process of the process, and then enter the name of a process in the protocol file system, thus showing you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines sent or generated by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log lines of the level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color than minutes of the level indicator. the color display of minutes lines can be switched off set-up dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you only want to display a particular process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the startup of the Samba server. in this case, use FilterStrip."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can turn the option to new lines in the main window pop-up menu to display all the new addition minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage this feature. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log message from the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Please find more information about the Sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion repository: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init quickly develops to the standard for controlling program start at startup of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is located under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important, because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reforming."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc, directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things such as setserial, which is started only once. such calls are to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in various places after the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you want to change the inittab file. if you want to change it, then you will be able to fix it by restarting the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually launch these scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, etc., network & etc; I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not tell trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move the scripts between running levels or move the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. this only happens if it removes an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them into a new space. to only copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and add them to the target area -- even if the same entry already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore records thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available systems services, runlevel 1 Start, runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the sorting number or name of an entry, press the input button to switch the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard running levels-, and now the machine is restarted. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution at runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE, or Delay (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services in these distributions are launched, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply terminated if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation relates to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made any changes, you need to save them. either you can use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two map cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled wildcards (quota) for users, a card map will be created, in case of shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD-Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the map card password management appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD -unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map card only appears if there is space limitation (quota.user / quota.group on the file system) if for at least one-time file system (quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the File System array with space restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the map card groups inform about group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"the dialog properties tab contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list."</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the fitting Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogously."</seg>
