although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American films , have d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate , who wanted to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was captiv@@ ated .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was like that the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very misch@@ iev@@ ous love letter about its size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declar@@ ing his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in multi@@ tudes for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes that he won with the Repub@@ lican Elec@@ tions , was the highest figure that a candidate nominated by the Party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the world view also did not correspond with the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
&quot; In@@ tolerance also contrasts with gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
she is still adapting to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
&quot; then there were still Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump sums up his way to the nominated repub@@ lican candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for dump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , I almost broke the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters than rac@@ ists .
&quot; to fit people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that those voters , most of whom are white , voted for dump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( NB . Ü ) : so much like &quot; lam@@ enting the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash word game , which means the great Van Jones , has killed precisely what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever beliefs or background you may have , America is welcome to everyone . &quot;
&quot; this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a manifestation for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your Americas ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices heard lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan was chat@@ ting with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and this is my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American kids don &apos;t let their love for music spoil by rub@@ b@@ ish

what is the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the Province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of Cat@@ ani@@ a ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
but this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
&quot; the young band members are very serious about their obligations to the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi writes : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laugh@@ ing and shining with gl@@ itter@@ ing eyes and playing trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is located practically on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ processed instruments made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that all were made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of Cat@@ ani@@ a , rec@@ alls the early times : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage , the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed as F@@ avi@@ o , something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra consisting of instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in Cat@@ ani@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that battles rag@@ ing illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known back then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia , before it searched the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were thus upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal law of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to pun@@ ish one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior manager of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at its time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which has crossed criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries established in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; alongside Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the Premier out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like and work together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , leader of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is tr@@ apped is hidden and it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
&quot; by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species should be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also controlled by the Schnec@@ k@@ ent@@ emp@@ o with the information between individual countries , actions are happening nowadays in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i also pursu@@ es the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea by satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in forbidden areas . also , such suspic@@ ious routes can be discovered , such as those who indicate that a ship will load his caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal gi@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are opposed to illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses to the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also assi@@ sts F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain estimated USD 20 million in lost turnover , which the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i lose every year due to the illegal fisher@@ man who inv@@ ade East African waters every year . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world . among these also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include acts like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of imag@@ inations , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Come to me . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
&quot; up to now , the closed front functions . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had distributed forged lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
builds a system that is designed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspic@@ ious vessels more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal vessels that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , a NGO , which also deals with fisher@@ y data and F@@ ISH @-@ i offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be loc@@ alized by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is said to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal vessels with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations on this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO sky Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Protection Organization : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each trac@@ eable ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; ships which had formerly been f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile reached a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fishing boats have bought more lic@@ ences ever since . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on the tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also note these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappeared annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there , six countries joined together in 2015 , to the West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; surely the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report his first great triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship running under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;

they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ as government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country fell into the void , having gathered on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country , including the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicine . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the reluc@@ tance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the election campaign Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join a mass rally for the support of the National Assembly in 2015 and a march to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Govern@@ ments , should continue to block the referendum . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among others as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday provincial civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;
notice : it &apos;s impossible to insert more than one sli@@ ders into the same page !
&quot; @ Mari@@ a@@ Corin@@ a@@ Y@@ A and @ so@@ y@@ f@@ del@@ r@@ inc@@ on : &quot; &quot; tomorrow we go to the street with the National Assembly - @ Nicol@@ as@@ Mad@@ uro must leave . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela , Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the frame of the Action Programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most common pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the prot@@ ectors : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures , which tell of disputes as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira have no skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many nation@@ alities do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , a info@@ graphic makes the turn that decreases the amount of repression per day : &quot;
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your removal !
on the road !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , has taken little against the dis@@ astro@@ us economic crisis and rather pre@@ tended to silence critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are getting more and more frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adap@@ tive version of an interview given by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , which was first published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qu@@ ij@@ ano now testi@@ fied to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; the trial , concluded on 24 August 2016 , investig@@ ates crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
&quot; for 34 years , he retained the secret of the family . &quot;
in the situation back then I believed that was al@@ right .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in the prison La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

Archi@@ val recording .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power has one parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole and you are looking forward to one of the ERP systems .
just notice that they do not kidn@@ ap you one day and I have to rescue you .
&quot; the Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party Argentina . &quot;
therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy papers belonging to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tort@@ ured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver inside it . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are being tort@@ ured there .
I approached and saw a couch tort@@ ured on people .
she looked like a bed and a metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied there .
&quot; they rarely bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ take him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty win@@ del .
&quot; later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a human being can harm another so much suffering ?
I was aware that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied together with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were brought back to the eye . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying face down@@ wards - all were tied at hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people still have a silent on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ st thou so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me before ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was aware that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man and killed .
&quot; ( according to claims by survivors of the Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina sentenced to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ zia , head of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this road and were tort@@ ured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ izing .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came to be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the im@@ position of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; prisoner of war &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war prey is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military emblem worn by an enemy that you fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the head of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; And you , who st@@ ole cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in rage , hit me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you alone . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
this is how my dad was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a wool cap pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a conspir@@ at@@ orial in this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you first have children , you realize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why kidn@@ ap children ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to whom one could pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ inst@@ ated , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remn@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were m@@ illed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the idea of showing my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations about all the atro@@ cities I had to experience with him .
&quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly abandoned and asked me why all exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he only said , &quot; &quot; Then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I reported the first advertisement . &quot;
I had finally realized he was a criminal .
nobody can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally have said against my own father .

&quot; the judgments of the &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended sentences of life imprisonment and in nine cases of sentences ranging between 2 and 14 years . &quot;
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Perm : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ en- terrorism &quot;
&quot; all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police members and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
the Court Ju@@ dge is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked on justice for the victims for many years .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial that is now run by human rights organisations . &quot;

translation failure makes elderly people in Kyoto a &quot; d@@ read@@ ful driving &quot;
&quot; the shield with the translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , in which one can pro@@ long its driving license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in Kyoto in Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where you can pro@@ long its driving license , in the last month witnessed a very bl@@ iss@@ ful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word was ph@@ oned by the &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ist &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; older driver &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - perhaps also with mal@@ icious but@@ t , and # 8@@ 212 , translated as a &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation from 1 to 20 September was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine , who has been widely shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware that the local newspapers were aware of it . &quot;
the paper published in Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n writes :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the incorrect English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto police force ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation mistake . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely ap@@ ologi@@ ze that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News dealt a bit more in detail with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , which are involved nation@@ ally in accidents , is quite a reason for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a proportion of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of total 11,@@ 850 accidents caused . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot;
the named repor@@ ter published in the version of the article published on Yahoo presented comments to the light that show what pre@@ concep@@ tions some Japanese people seem to have toward older drivers :
&quot; the article on Yahoo , on the translation error , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; is that ( &quot; &quot; d@@ read@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real mine for these bizarre bug in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , one needs two important skills : passive language skills in order to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
the latter requires active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking is the belief that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers .
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which may translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for translation , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and mysterious pro@@ positions arise , which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints , which often emb@@ ell@@ ish T @-@ shirts and bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more thorough translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the City of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source for its translation . &quot;
Venezuela : take protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV websites were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online stations also survived recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was capped , and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting about protests . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ usi@@ t later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a closure of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also applies to the Internet page at which the National Assembly carries out its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute of Press and Society ( IPC ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond to certain domains faul@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds faul@@ ty or ref@@ uses to request such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , was imprisoned on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was defeated while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : thus , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans are increasingly difficult to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimony of other cri@@ st@@ ables that were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a critic published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , Mov@@ ing Schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she became ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , there are more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her min@@ ors @-@ year @-@ old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , an education and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised . &quot;
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ l. - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name because the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated in the Cri@@ adi@@ ta , generally keeps silence . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in believing that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; , &quot; sur@@ passes to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family assi@@ mil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies his exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon occ@@ ured in the secret of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra reached Mar@@ ín with a stick until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest letters and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos was widely spread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay there are more cows as children registered , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the married couple and 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation into the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to murder the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the Life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ par@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the farm where her father worked , had to register and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work all and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours each day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to split the time so that she still had time to learn . &quot;
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , it cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the househ@@ older than eating out of the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the manager Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read Edi@@ tori@@ als from the opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her not to believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator regime .
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not talk to her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had enabled her to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything she had received from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the chic@@ anes , who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ lla when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I did not belong to any group . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share vac@@ ancies for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group leader is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please send us an e @-@ mail .
starting from Monday if possible .
&quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third commentary , &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work &quot; was written . &quot;
then the author of the ad switched on again :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again , if something is . &quot;
the business was closed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ¡ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;

&quot; in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í , and the indigenous population under@@ went their toll and became Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writing Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to a bill on &quot; the regulations on the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , there would be a place that is assigned to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a cash transaction . &quot;
&quot; the bill consists of six parag@@ rap@@ hs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are able to impose registration on users who do not register , given the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ adh Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and Promot@@ er of the Legisl@@ ative Dec@@ ree , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and a password to come through the fire@@ wall blocked by Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity , to access the network . &quot;
but it has not yet been known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; lead researcher &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously then it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities , and also to bring them to a court case . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; in order to be passed on as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Legisl@@ ative Assembly and the constitutional committees , before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the parliament , in whose senses the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP @-@ President Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence imposed for those destined to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kur@@ dish conserv@@ ation@@ ologist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq marked by war

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular species of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecosystem will also depend on a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a picture of a big cat in the cam@@ er@@ af@@ alle , R@@ aza breaks out in pure pleasure . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to show passionate about another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies for wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region are set up .
&quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and filmm@@ aker , produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot;
&quot; his works have appeared in numerous international publications including the TIME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times . &quot;
&quot; Meyer filmed films for National Ge@@ ographic , P@@ BS , CN@@ N and HB@@ O . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture has been a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami that originated from it . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate have been ev@@ acu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; still , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows which progress has been made six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned sub@@ stitu@@ tions ( due to Qu@@ at@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft shel@@ ters ( the &quot; &quot; cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) was forced to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the catastrophe of the D@@ reif@@ ach catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation systems , who were hau@@ led after the disaster in shel@@ ters , were moved to final homes . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to establish , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by the disaster , opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , have been largely imp@@ as@@ sion@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent of destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are only 6@@ 90 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only be 75 per cent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe , nearly half of the inhabitants of the coast , it is difficult to find their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to be able to establish a complete picture , the paper brought up numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
in its introduction the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to find out more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; as for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture , &quot;
&quot; in its issue to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witn@@ essing the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; between 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , moved to permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the 2017 stand , still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation systems , still in temporary shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . it is known that efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that are to be held in Tokyo 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak another language , the differences seem to be greater first than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we cover issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . published with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was sent to the intensive care unit at the age of 33 : a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part nationwide at a protest march .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
its condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
on the pictures there is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a head@@ stock . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian Federal State of Go@@ i@@ ás knew that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive station , his face would be seen for six months on television and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several medi@@ ators rush to him shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

police raid shel@@ ters
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there was a brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers put protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; member of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to abst@@ ain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via speakers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window of windows . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a broken glass window in order to design their cover page illustr@@ atively with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ up bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window of window than about the protests of thousands of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
you must also recognize this if you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on con@@ front@@ ational course with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the villages in Cuba forget about the un@@ indu@@ str@@ alization
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mol@@ ds in all of Cuba opened the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the Western cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no appreci@@ able sugar@@ s on site . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane mills .
&quot; after planting , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its facilities , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some altern@@ ated the work .
&quot; others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who runs every day at 4 : 00 am , does not ro@@ b the crisis in the sugar cane industry . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane mol@@ ds in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls the fact that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced quantity . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer something new . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw a better time .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive they were unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories which could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agriculture perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will surely enter the story , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be received , they constituted a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially auth@@ ored documents , which were only differentiated with regard to the parts which would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ an Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters became more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the dis@@ ordered factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mol@@ ds in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in whose construction he helped .
&quot; with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work producer was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working places and services that generated the facilities in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former President in the eyes of the persons present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things changed , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dem@@ ol@@ ish them , they also stopped to asp@@ ire the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without prospects for the future , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve to supply the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a post @-@ supporting person , but he does not forgive the lies that you told him . &quot;
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes for 65 years in pension , not because it lacks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop supervis@@ ors have brought mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop thus ends with the fact that the young participants learn topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ perception , &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because workshops were so popular , the team also collabor@@ ated with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ mit@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road section in western Canada , on which nearly two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the ref@@ rain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop Group who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; this way , they can grow and move ahead with our youth as well . &quot;
so they can do what they have meant by the Creator .
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ents of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and adds the verse in Sil@@ den@@ buch ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
plastic dishes not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of a typical restaurant in Japan &quot; . &quot; &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers exactly what is on the menu , near the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) are exhibited by each dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customer sees these plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend now turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger I@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin sandy pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic geri@@ chten decorated mobile @-@ tapes as shown at the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , refrigerator mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more elaborate .
&quot; in this case , an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple holding your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon @-@ ro@@ gens are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my cell phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic weights can also take on a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members uncomfortable . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , we also have pad@@ dies ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic courts can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # which has been the &quot; &quot; Sch@@ r@@ ash@@ tag # &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which devot@@ es itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ icker . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the poor@@ est and killed regularly appear only in statistics . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , little one looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the communities who have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with the Drug Poli@@ cies &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were involved in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime not only allows us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the P@@ ain of the Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is searching for secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews at just one single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed , to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an education . &quot;
there is also my mother who is here with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
&quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for a few years now .
&quot; every day I pass by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ icker ) if he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is as if they ridicul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statistic .
&quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified , that they were &quot; &quot; inc@@ ess@@ ant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to argue that they will be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and be silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals were forced to withdraw money from their business for month until they had destroyed not only the business , but also tore up their family apart . &quot;
you think of all that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , tor@@ tillas and make &quot; &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy who consists of violence and had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks from his home , saw the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence is mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizens &apos; council for public security and the government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8,5 Mor@@ des per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories live in the face of always new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to describe the complex information behind the failed war against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
if one image is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strö@@ ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false identification of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample proof coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank truck dropped to the victim . &quot;
&quot; representative representatives described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people who looked at the World Cup . &quot;
houses of burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned with recognition .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the event form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lying on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years , the same Photo has been tap@@ ed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , although real but not related to trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters from the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses were dras@@ tically reported by atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to include cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were dism@@ ember@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of de@@ preci@@ ation ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely for@@ ge the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media , in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the le@@ thal persecution of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya .
&quot; according to a lightning detection , published by the United Nations described those who could flee wounds , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , wrong@@ ly claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to see this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organisations , who called AF@@ P as their source , were wrong@@ ly attributed to this statement , but had not brought the image out of the DR Congo . &quot;
the global reach of false information
traces of these false cou@@ plings date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ u@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixing mask private pages , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded wrong reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have restricted examples of mis@@ use and brought them into contact with the respective countries on which side they were published , thus we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which are also linked to each other in some cases ) , several examples can be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases which can be fully fu@@ eled now ( on the map in orange ) :

examples of false cop@@ ulations of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries are still available on pages or servers over the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available .
&quot; countries in grey are examples , which according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ u@@ Eye are probably also indic@@ ative of counter@@ fei@@ ting examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; this post , which addressed the members of the Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Kongo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , bringing the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who have been murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , Catholic @-@ related news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the picture is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later came into circulation in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the El Pa@@ is newspaper attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; they wanted to achieve greater attention to those events that allegedly took place in the name of Islam , presum@@ ably in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was taken as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and ret@@ we@@ eted more than 9.@@ 300 times ) but the emb@@ assi@@ es associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim of paying attention to the relative number of deaths and comparing media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that allegedly was written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one in Vietnam@@ ese and explained it to Fal@@ se &apos;s announcement . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;

( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to major discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life are both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and th@@ ru@@ sts the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern is that violent imag@@ ery readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing and giving them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media seem to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think deeply about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually can be derived from the context or in a completely impro@@ per way . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false write @-@ downs should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot;
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese su@@ ck ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist hard any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the V@@ ap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Trust your parents in recognition of how your younger years have stri@@ ved for you .
words in H@@ uns@@ metric language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having war@@ med up in the sun on cold days . &quot;
in Birds My words from his blog about :
&quot; they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this side to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are greatly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and flood disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , usually at the end of May , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya joined the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following a statement by the Sri L@@ ank@@ an earthquake centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of floo@@ ds and mud winds . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly walked back . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children after more rainf@@ alls are already on its way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stopped in floo@@ ds , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village in G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday &apos;s floo@@ ding water peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents involved in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been trans@@ figured to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka supplies important information on flood and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app , so that the data center will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; button that allowed users to access a vehicle for retri@@ eving assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded for free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; button , which resulted in more than 1,000 requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and provide help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

use approved . in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust her my four year old daughter ; she trust@@ s to me her children ; she is my rock in br@@ anding .
in the last minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; in the next , we have the right to trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others can@@ es slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already brought this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they mi@@ tig@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all stuck in the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit , will be ab@@ orted . &quot;
to be ab@@ orted
I &apos;m not alone .
&quot; that even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what kind of images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception the religion of Rum@@ i was er@@ ased , as was the most popular translation of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should be feared and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ fied the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures continue to rise further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ less nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not even select their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women , which lead movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it cle@@ ars the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has st@@ aff@@ ed our collective imagination such deep and flaw@@ ed that often Sik@@ h men and children are aimed at anti @-@ viral attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims form the &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scrap@@ ers ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh , named Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now ir@@ reversible Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of taking out my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief worn by all Muslims - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ per W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ ute , we do not wear all the ker@@ chief with us . &quot;
we also need not be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists striving to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islamic machine series with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger that tears the veil off his head . &quot;

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be seen , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the br@@ anding that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter if I kept her in my arms , and she whis@@ pers the Arabic verses to protect the Qur &apos;an and call the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil that one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be seen , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

use approved .
&quot; belonging to this is the picture of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters , as they gain decades ago a competition of the art of the flower arran@@ ger in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of her that I see at that moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means speaking of the prayers that she had told me to speak , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a nation that has been colon@@ ised for centuries by a &quot; empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name Ehr@@ worthy British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging is to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan quar@@ rel@@ essly we@@ pt for his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family he could not join in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first fly bom@@ b@@ shell of the story was dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ ish subject of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever had , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread over every continent apart from the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic , went into Iraq to hunt mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy comes to the United States and the suspect has a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer @-@ call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion conce@@ als more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim countries that began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that includes its borders towards people from just the countries that are bombing .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely accepts Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we carry , and the bombs which we cast into Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at North@@ western University showed a scientifically accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are too deeply involved to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognise the roots of our fears , and the dangerous and dangerous prints which we are ste@@ aling in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to grasp our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history in many cases . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ ar ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ eia ; the vir@@ ale video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ IC , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global point in which we are .
and that moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they are grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me today a must @-@ have Muslim . &quot;

&quot; more than a hundred acade@@ mics describe our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are not concepts with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

&quot; we all have to ask ourselves , why ? &quot;
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people have been enth@@ r@@ alled by the creation of the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation four decades ago , were scientists of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously consoli@@ dating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I imagine in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to other &quot; made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are , to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listening often related to &quot; understanding &quot; these events instead &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers will first introduce and translate their story in their own language and then explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants aren &apos;t professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dedication and representation allow the audience to get involved . &quot;
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ ang@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the importance of his fi@@ ddle , John Ny@@ iner@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you listened !
they were alert ...
they were with me !
&quot; up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story scre@@ enings . &quot;
Puerto Rico ur@@ ges the United States to re @-@ establish sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last April 3 , 2017 , the march began with the Vatican Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( People &apos;s Front for the Ne@@ ar Testing of the debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
the interc@@ essors of the re@@ constitution of the debt also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers , and government agencies responsible for debt will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be found with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .

the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , imposed measures will be at risk to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration wore the name &quot; Night watch for Light and Truth . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , supporters and relatives continue their campaign for freedom and remind of the contributions that he has provided for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference dedicated to the digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated an event to the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the German CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of published books within three to five days , published excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to b@@ ass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built and what is the real cost associated with .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on site to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create something meaningful from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the list of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Mem@@ ories &quot; &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice expressing his freedom and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison , a non @-@ military establishment , was transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that the &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; b@@ ass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that it was contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders to the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
but his place of residence and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predictable than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el could not know at that time that ten years after working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this strip in digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet finish this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life , dre@@ aming of freedom and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace it . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ al she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in jail . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book@@ cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; everyone of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guar@@ dians &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; that I bear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
to return all the moments
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the incar@@ cer@@ ation of Bass@@ el :
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
during the week
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you &apos;re still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared since the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) . &quot;
&quot; those arrested or disappeared under the use of force by the regime , were tort@@ ured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; since 2011 , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in detention until 2016 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of b@@ ass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : after dism@@ iss@@ al condemned by corruption again on previous post
&quot; Mozambique was re@@ acted with anger against corruption , in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants in 2010 with four other defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was to Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on 19th April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ aza to get back to his old post , because the company did not undertake any disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Center for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
&quot; however , the company apparently kept silent and did not adopt appropriate legal steps for the application of the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been approved . &quot;
&quot; he could keep paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly be paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director had no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks morality to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself at the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself had become tired of this man , which was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ iel , to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to remember the Mozambique Channel , but also as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cutting @-@ edge and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most prominent oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , with which he disp@@ at@@ ches money , res@@ ig@@ ns again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ Á@@ Pa@@ is - Det@@ ached Prop@@ ylene ( @ az@@ awa _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or bac@@ on . &quot;
&quot; photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ port@@ ed &quot;
&quot; according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took off their posts from the web because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin , or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or is the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ usive con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today , Kal@@ ar may be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call out hate speech . &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts in order to express their use have been cens@@ ored .
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ker A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; like :
a mail of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a spiritual way , whether they knew how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very much but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook ought to be more analytical before it delet@@ es all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing to Fac@@ e@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post , and check it by checking the words side by side . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ ins &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , have received quite a good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that cens@@ orship by keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative notation of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; was ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch , post and share content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a number of people &apos;s posts that have no negative intentions or simply try to demonstrate their opinions against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the initiative began , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and thus prohibited the words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits would have given them a big sales , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat an inheritance curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot used with approval .
&quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , then do you heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with approval .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in Myanmar communities , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to bring out the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
&quot; but instead of cens@@ oring the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; , &quot; it would have been better to look at the context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the child @-@ marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament has unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the age @-@ ready age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change in marriage , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere because age does not determine age . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; every person under 18 years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the percentage of children already married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements which endeav@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws on the child @-@ marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition made tension in this really un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent self contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country has to agree and pro@@ claim the law .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again : &quot;
&quot; Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one decided against it . &quot;
&quot; after it was previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now be applied to the law . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has used too much time and unnecessary talk , which disgu@@ ises the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s wo@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , it definitely took long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status @-@ Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , &quot; Out@@ standing news ! &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the mar@@ ry age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amend@@ ment of the sp@@ ouses was approved today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 MPs in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all MEPs who were against were voted in favour of the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # chil@@ dish @-@ chil@@ dish @-@ shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
heart@@ y congratulations .
a Thank You to our MEPs .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take court steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to be inviting his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to address the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; instead of talking about the problem , rather than talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would say that the state , our daughters , would say that they are ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ bo@@ iled men that are opposed to them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; but there are still places in the world where children &apos;s wo@@ es are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that they submit . &quot;

&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ ded with the Day of Russia - the Russian National Day , the website of the prosec@@ utor of Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was h@@ acked . h@@ ackers have left a funny message &quot; &quot; St@@ ays at home &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the h@@ ackers posted the YouTube video &quot; &quot; He is not a di@@ mmer for you &quot; &quot; on the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; &quot; the Office of the Public Prosecutor calls the citizens to not follow the pro@@ voc@@ ations and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
&quot; at 11 : 15 , the message was removed from the side - however , in the cache it remained intact . &quot;
do you have any questions ?
&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office told the local news service Yar@@ News that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; by mirrors web pages , Turkish users can watch Wikipedia contents again &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ ki@@ pedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the US , internationally . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share reliable and reliable information . &quot;
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blocking .
&quot; although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report of the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be blocked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of the legal ban .
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put all of it on to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
IP@@ FS also admitted that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the necessity for nature conservation
&quot; a sw@@ inging N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him , they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed colours . &quot;
the motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to gra@@ vit@@ ate the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nep@@ tune &apos;s wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ackle pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar asp@@ ires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fri@@ ghtening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know , for he was standing with Tig@@ ers face to face . &quot;
a tiger can not be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ zz@@ ard appeared . he sits down immediately , we see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the advancement of Nep@@ al@@ as nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photos of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and took six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , who live near the tourist arri@@ vals . &quot;

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;

&quot; this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ neys and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that because of social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should ignore the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and rejected by her family and community after she had addressed a married relative with her name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives is also not known by their names , is also common among men . however , they have far less warran@@ ts to fear , if any , they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district of Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , played a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them alone in which they discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the removal of patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ w has been working with the help of their video camera in the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s council to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this club . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her panel discussion , was of women who do not call her hus@@ bands to name . &quot;
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem that women could easily identify with .
&quot; not saying the names of their hus@@ bands lou@@ dly , is a custom that they are all oblig@@ ated and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not keep this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent until the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned around to me and said I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion in motion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she said all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the crus@@ hing of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women should never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she was only inti@@ mid@@ ating during the whole exercise , another decided to let the whole frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ tail@@ ing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the rush of adren@@ alin , having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received numerous reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing a zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the sp@@ ouses : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the blin@@ king point if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing on him .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves to not wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip on any discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to make sure who could hear what could be heard , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example our identi@@ ties attached to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ one @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of her own choice of clothes , morality linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ ts ( upper shirts ) into a panel discussion , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirms that things come slowly into the roll : &quot;
so far we have only taken small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ Red on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ edge for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini says :
each one of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on June 29th of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was made up with the Japanese Twitter trend in Japanese Twitter , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is seen as the turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war era .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewing the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here have become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka said , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . after 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese Kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les out@@ lived everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Winn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it sounds for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the famous places related to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you must absolutely visit : &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( Out of link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) Liverpool
pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
the same we did last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan base in the market for marketing purposes , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
I will listen to &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .

gl@@ amor@@ ous men are taken away in Mozambique and killed
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia were warned the population that gl@@ amor@@ ous men could be targets of attacks in Mozambique .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for the organ@@ ists , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , concerns the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange district , a few kilometers from Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
&quot; given to local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia declared the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this led to the fact that the UN , in the South African country , conducted a mission to investigate this practice . &quot;
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an men who travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest murder of three bald men based on their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the Mil@@ ange district , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ Bris@@ bane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police have already followed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of fellow @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men have been killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty faced by Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I like to urge YOU MO@@ SA@@ IC@@ ES , THE S@@ ME har@@ ms a country where people would have shame to go on the streets and others would not hurt or even take their lives to get their bread , a country in which people would not hurt or even steal their lives to get their bread , a country in which people would be hun@@ ted to get their bread , or even their lives to get their bread . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor . &quot;
&quot; twe@@ et@@ ete to twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police officer Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed : &quot;
mos@@ ambi@@ os authorities are very worried about the kill@@ ings of bald people .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , imprisoned in Chinese , has drawn attention to the international community after he had announced his lawyer at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized in the hospital for liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; &quot; sub@@ version &quot; , &quot; having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and says a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critici@@ zed the stringent treatment of the pair in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to give Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway in a nut@@ shell
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about his release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was con@@ ferred to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon exports to China since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; having spread the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to rid Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as it helps him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the message promp@@ ted Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the U.S. embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to intervene in isolated and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to impose the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally released . &quot;

Germany - The Netherlands
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was appearing on the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the Reuters news agency that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tices for Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :

France &apos;s foreign ministry demanded China in an explanation on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan for a long time
&quot; on 27 June , the Council of Land Affairs in Taiwan asked China to release Li@@ u and demonstrate a greater tolerance towards those who are using peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
Tai@@ wan@@ ese leg@@ is@@ lators Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the ill @-@ intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama ( in German )
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried in an explanation on June 28 around Li@@ u and gave that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , had led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore to be considered as a city .
nobody asked if New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; reverse the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons led by Shan@@ mu@@ cus were not very no@@ bel : he was defending an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal juris@@ dic@@ tions &apos; , in view of this , he seemed inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently managed by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re of author@@ itarian rulers again emerges who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , aband@@ ons the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ cus were really non @-@ answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system . &quot;
he tar@@ ried the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers ration@@ ally .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ cus to clarify his opinion , since it did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our cheap K Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point unless he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points to the criticism that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ cus &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was more a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ easy even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; no country &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ cus , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , a member of the new generation of political leaders in Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes , correctly associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
does Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam have committed a mistake or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally countryside and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the cabinet of government , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore pay their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must our Prime Minister pay back ?
what is the value of our pink employee identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a town : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear testim@@ onies like &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world will be exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be a pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor , asking for personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may boil in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that differs Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadian .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you would change me like Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the post@@ mark &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , being &apos; nice &apos; is basically to be fun - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting and not to earn attention .
&quot; this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a majority of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just chil@@ ly pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I am connecting with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy . &quot;
musical video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that trans@@ codes the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and , in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what rules his girlfriend makes . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video relates indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was divided into 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ f@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; recruitment of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are seen as critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was also set up in the army that supervis@@ es online contents and prosec@@ utes people accused of being denied the monarchy , prosec@@ uting criminal law . &quot;
Thailand sets out a strict case against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este . &quot;
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later he came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
&quot; one of the problems the jun@@ ta continued to pursue is its decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery vehicle before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are imprisoned , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song was showing members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in Eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the post @-@ war society slowly reco@@ vers itself very slowly in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages in the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ foil of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ sch@@ asia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked to Soviet pages in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the county has been 16@@ ,000 people after it has barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ k@@ ka , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 3 ) 3,@@ 8@@ 64 6@@ 19 Happy Bir@@ th@@ day New@@ by ! ! ! &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all served by the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with blown splend@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
&quot; in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they withdraw instantly . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photograp@@ hed , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) , such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; a 90 year old wife , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was little work and everyone lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation is drawing to the end , a little boy is running past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him afterwards .

a group of children now tracks the ball .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border between Mexico and Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and published here with kind permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is managed by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear . &quot;
it is named Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.50 a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bald , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ um Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some of them slept already outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ be@@ ard ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lovingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often travelling the route and that Afri@@ cans speak already at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy grew weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money necessary to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Frau Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; he replies , smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez men@@ tions that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them , or to tell her about the course of her journey . &quot;
it declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explained that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he was asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , the travelers always consult their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she bl@@ ets in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there &apos;s one of her daughter with African hair stain@@ s she made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she puts her briefly in front of me .

&quot; on 10 July , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which it in@@ stru@@ cts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities did not use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would investigate and track the sources and distri@@ butions of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans , and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filtering for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; may enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict regions , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet on Twitter based media outlet &quot; Images from In China &quot; ( which has taken the cens@@ ored news in China ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point on which polic@@ emen random@@ ly checked out if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile message required that people will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the production technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; furthermore , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which highlighted that the software can record the password request of a Windows operating system , and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are converted into electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both internally and extern@@ ally . &quot;
one who makes honor to her name .
one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters are transformed into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts dis@@ solve in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is on the axis of disaster . you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that didn &apos;t suff@@ ice to make &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security servant form@@ ulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it suff@@ iced , so that the city sm@@ iled the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; writing . &quot;
&quot; all quarters of the city sought after , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , no rain , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that is fed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had a cal@@ ming effect , after the power supply in the neighborhood ceased to function . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence , crying out several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt courage@@ ous enough to work together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you fre@@ t the spirit out of the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low you - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have cried out all the way to the office of security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; let me also hear , how you sh@@ out &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not nearby . &quot;
his fi@@ du@@ ly @-@ filled eyes focused on me .
&quot; and you are afraid to look into my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never ceased to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father is equal with that . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this acc@@ urs@@ ed sentence is still in my nose until today .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed to months . &quot;
I walked through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ eive all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; unlike otherwise , they probably have assigned me a larger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner , and I must immediately sit down without waiting for her permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I grab@@ bed an old tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : hitting the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell rade was a &quot; &quot; prisoner &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me in the end .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was an elderly man of middle age , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there are no distinctive im@@ balances in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I stay .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
&quot; I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row , to drive away all these crow@@ s , which refres@@ hed themselves in the fruits of the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear them cry &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time , the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; reference to the 13th wh@@ ore of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus , the secret was v@@ ented : to protect the security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they spoke in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al press card and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house here , it is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I supervised the audi@@ torium and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me like that . &quot;
&quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin to close this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication after a friendly conversation for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to make this penalty . &quot;
at punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er at@@ tain@@ eth at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him , and you cannot hold your cry . &quot;
my scre@@ ams weren &apos;t enough for him yet why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a collector , or if that belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still on the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the hang@@ man re@@ marked the cooling down and didn &apos;t find any fav@@ ours , why he was next to an electri@@ cally charged bar . &quot;
&quot; electricity f@@ lowed whole body , enough to supply my entire quarter . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which lay stretched on the floor , was the perfect power manager . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to go to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; once he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigarette to discover between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel accomplished its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ e@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks their old @-@ approved opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the whole Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking and can witness with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he won a special a@@ version against American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b views his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion is for those trying to survive in war zones , something with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee from the second generation . &quot; he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own living circumstances , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a human , &quot; while in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the mu@@ gs talk warm coffee and the ra@@ ke of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose first line of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you have a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - not to land in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some of the MPs who support the Islamic Campaign &apos;s Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual inc@@ eption Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert night . &quot;
&quot; the dep@@ u@@ ties and former press spokes@@ men in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ aven@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the well @-@ tried legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimates the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to stand for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simply rhetor@@ ic , but indeed an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in the year 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b returned to Lei@@ be by traditional sex @-@ men , having completed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently low @-@ married woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
&quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; Hon@@ our mor@@ des &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ our kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still difficult to support Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women , who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence , may be imprisoned at in@@ definite time in prison , and their release often requires a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarant@@ y of the family that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
&quot; also , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s music is very popular and is known to not shy away from subjects that long as tab@@ oo in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ usions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics nar@@ rated to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song called &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and every other is also . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can , in his words , &quot; &quot; get what you want &quot; &quot; - whether it &apos;s faith or non @-@ belief , het@@ ero or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of homosexu@@ als and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been critically cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online programme Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a modified version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ clear , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ ys , who later worked on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do this ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , did nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the Hai@@ tian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression , and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service identified several former members of the government and members of the teachers &apos; association , with the ration@@ ale that they were critically app@@ alled in comments in social media , related to the deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg ; the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la a performance for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it sees H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , streams , and artificial democr@@ acies . at least he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue , and consequently resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big and extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing have mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ si@@ sm , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to snap a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two flo@@ ats are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and a stunning way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high sti@@ cker was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sc@@ iss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

out@@ ward appearance and body care were seldom as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate job like those of the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are com@@ mon@@ place . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing a growing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming increasingly more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can train these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts confront each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the hair@@ dressing salon , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only college in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , as we have built this educational community out of love with the children . &quot;
Colombia : letters of love to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters

&quot; the following article is the revised version of the article entitled &quot; Love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel exp@@ elled , accommod@@ ating aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this question was no longer a question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a of the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
only recently their country was the scene of historical events and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the Guer@@ ill@@ ab@@ ew@@ eg@@ ung F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bian people , however , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ac@@ ev , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , had been subjected to war rhetor@@ ic and carried out their arms around the clock , must now be integrated into life as a civilian . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now enter into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help with the integration process .
&quot; so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters in order to welcome them back to society . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , which should then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters of reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , which needed most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story into a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municipal Auth@@ orities of Cal@@ i and Leonardo von der Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be passed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed over the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters lived ) I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter , who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gren@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I will answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I reply . &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and set me beside the gar@@ net .
&quot; perhaps he was tired of war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there that is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the beginning , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders joined a panel discussion . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already at war and the F@@ ARC already ag@@ itated in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have seen how social injustice eman@@ ated from the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape the society in this country more equ@@ itable . &quot;
&quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear those people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I &apos;ve often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings , which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; for example , Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant of the camp at Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote in the example of the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people ready to attack arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now sit on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and whose first publication took place on the website OC Media .
&quot; hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the coverage of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat posed like a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ worth over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published that them@@ ed the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she shed light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspected que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear around her life , she ultimately moved to the United States . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos from my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App got the round . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just taking out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you return the family , you Sho@@ ck @-@ stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and finally wo@@ ke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called for an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung wings . &quot;
OC Media : in which cases were you laid - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there &apos;s my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , sign me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
&quot; they put absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender that everything was bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world not only your family but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mo@@ m became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors arrived and res@@ cu@@ ed them .
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
&quot; after it happened the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought it without registering me , without ID , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
just to prove you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot;
I still wear some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male shape . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed away ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who received a month and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not join a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end ask for proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are still gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
&quot; if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know they are held there , so that they can later be presented as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show off their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot;
you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , they were specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise . &quot;
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard grew .
there was no news from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports about it so far . however , we assume that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I wore my hair forever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 I was already known all over Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in serious !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was true , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia , originally , wanted to bring us back to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zation , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria never hurt me just a hair .
&quot; before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; they often say to children , when they make fun of the sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just shut their eyes closed to you , because they believed they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted , and never sm@@ itten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
nevertheless - one could sense how people began to change in the city .
&quot; those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed beforehand , looked at you at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could sense how the situation in the Republic was getting worse . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I still work as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I join them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I have no p@@ enny for this .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up breeding places .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; this is the nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to whit@@ ew@@ ash you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ an who , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have the ones ; on the whole planet , they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant to hear . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know many think of transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a mistake . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be exact , different ways of life . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not harm me for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know I am myself now .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ or region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to have the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had lit himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ ag@@ awa hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the combustion engines were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything any more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family pat@@ ters , who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families and doing a safe job due to the persecution of the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large proportion of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Empire took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing only slowly , and the local population is getting little from that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas , where the provinces are Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen@@ ing the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are searching for a job , completed 55 % of a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy &quot; aimed at exter@@ min@@ ating the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or of human rights activ@@ ist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; due to this , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sec@@ ts and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process is a combination of a high number of new ethnic per@@ spir@@ es and anti @-@ Arab discrimination . &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and to be employed , as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must endure , human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and gaining knowledge of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be femin@@ ist in general . &quot;
&quot; for example , in spite of equal education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and soci@@ etal standards still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and thre@@ ef@@ old among them . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I get to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black female women , on black female women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices &quot; and &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , &quot; my Lord to sing , &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ating violence , that we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot;
&quot; in addition , black women and women of other ethnic and ethnic origin deserve less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center is the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in her mind , which refers to both the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white femin@@ ist oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech , &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is an un@@ men@@ ded and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give a home to women of different backgrounds and to distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to dis@@ solve myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana ur@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we ourselves rec@@ en ourselves ) we can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which constitute the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment in which my life has neither escaped , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine devoted to international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern throughout the region of Kurdist@@ an in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
&quot; in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his community . &quot;
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organ@@ iz@@ ations of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq , a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmm@@ aker in Er@@ bil , Iraq , and multimedia journ@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on the following , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; by Elec@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect affected persons .
&quot; a Police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse , the acute indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not help . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman returned her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women first permit an ad , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all . &quot;
&quot; accounting W@@ atings and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a Legal System , which does not sub@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot;
but the available figures are al@@ ar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 displays of domestic violence began with the District Prosecutor &apos;s Office . 70 % of this was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads reported by the police came from women .
there were over 5000 adver@@ ts due to domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of the ads of women came here too .
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; to any woman who counts in Paraguay for psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; for any woman who ref@@ uses for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible ab@@ uses and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she still wanted to regret it . she should regret it forever . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she wore psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women would be sub@@ missive , because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he said rhetor@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen ill of Carlos for so long , and didn &apos;t leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse should at least have a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ an &apos;s case , everything began with psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
their wealthy partner even managed to convince them that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements in the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach and flaw@@ ed implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Not Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ dom@@ ly to an independent alleged off@@ ence and pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ ly as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the text was changed to a number of points in order to win even the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill provided the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which have to bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to allow an ad and get a safe place to stop the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse as part of human relationships is seen . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators will be punished . &quot;
we must allow for such a long indication until mal@@ treatment is no longer regarded as normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been altered . among other things , a passage took place which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the submission of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media dump@@ ed in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in jail where he is a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er al @-@ Abr@@ i were also arrested and brought to trial , but later they returned free . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dism@@ issed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the sole Sultan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander , Minister of Finance , Minister of Finance , Chairman of the Supreme Council of Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the domination of the sul@@ t@@ ans is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , including domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , to restrict and to torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities are systematically limiting peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for freedom of the press in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties tied up hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on July 26th , 2016 . this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials into court decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were charged with putting pressure on the Supreme Court judge in Oman to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by ISS before the special department and arrested upon his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS issued the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief following Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the directive that &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper was prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in Mas@@ k@@ at took place in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , to disturb@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of a violation of a public ban and a slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ani@@ ans ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; on 22 August 2016 , he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j den@@ ounced the appeal court in a hearing on 26 December 2016 . al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for a year and al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information Minister issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed an additional statement in which the shut@@ down of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended three additional months , with which the Minister reiter@@ ated another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ als to re @-@ permit the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Korean authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) invites the Korean authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
2. create a secure environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judi@@ ci@@ ary vill@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of opinion and association , and the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; for the need for medical research performed on @-@ site , there are two reasons : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the supply of the global health care system , which cover the specific medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed serious health effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Sam@@ b@@ ish national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I &apos;m just starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that has to change , otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of being a maker yourself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
= = = &gt; P@@ yp@@ s = = = &gt; P@@ yp@@ s = = = &gt; Sk@@ yl@@ yn@@ x
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you previously did not have ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
what is the opinion of the public about science and acade@@ mics in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the more difficult access to scientific expertise that challenge here . &quot;
&quot; the system means that magazines can only be made accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ right , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question , how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get , limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants , such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia @-@ old tradition mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer since its work becomes more and more difficult . &quot;
it &apos;s as if in a river there would be a b@@ oul@@ der that I must yo@@ del .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in front of judgment , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he has also joined a movement that becomes ever greater in the USA and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman o@@ at of the sort Out@@ side gorgeous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement origin@@ ates from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
&quot; it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders can commit to others to freely use the seeds that they have bred . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately to select them - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ fied professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the open @-@ source movement does not deal with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; anyone who wants to buy good , local and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is offered in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened . &quot;
food sovereignty without sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that others continue to provide their seeds free of charge , in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; there are not such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that large @-@ scale plants such as wheat are patented in an even bigger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
plants are grown so that they have targeted features - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and hold threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders will dimin@@ ish more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more important than ever since the changed conditions are far worse predic@@ tible due to climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts the view that intellectual property is owned by other breeders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , it promotes it by providing more material and expertise available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight already . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of developing plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , Plant breeders in the US @-@ state Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety also breeds its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , which cultiv@@ ates in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject patents , or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that bree@@ der by avoiding plant pat@@ enting would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like me with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my ri@@ vals will sell my grades in a few years . &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years before competition , which makes it really easy for my opinion . &quot; &quot; worldwide response &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly across the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also assi@@ sts them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ col works on an open source license , which ultimately forms a formally and legally binding form of O@@ SS@@ I obligations for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; regulations for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which should be scheduled for scheduled next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link from the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that there will soon be more people to recognize it . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make clear to the people that there is even more left behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend at the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the web site of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , docum@@ enting human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; in spite of this attack and the ri@@ dic@@ ule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law , it has never been as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first licensed website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles , which he writes for not accessible websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he addressed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , who is home to the also Zi@@ adas blog , is on the other hand more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he talked about the student protests and took a video how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mostly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself about blocking the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to block is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi &apos;s priority ; and although the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege . an arrest , an attempt to murder , summ@@ ons at the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I was working . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even though only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post items to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after having locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courage@@ ous go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 web sites . this included technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; af@@ te also documented the closure of providers , enabled by the move of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blocking of websites that offer V@@ PN@@ s began . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that could have access to Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decisions of cens@@ orship are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian people have no legal basis by which they can proceed against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

&quot; day after day newspapers throughout Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es ro@@ b pharmac@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ p sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , n@@ avy and Luf@@ tw@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in 2017 . &quot;
the non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; thus , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 , published the Editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision expressed the paper like this :
&quot; everything , however , devi@@ ates from civil@@ ised standards and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rup@@ ture in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper continues : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , who first sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; have used more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , argued that violence was a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning , as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ acent neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; in Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; says Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; it is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has under@@ lined the state &apos;s security policy for many years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the federal state Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by employing a massive police force . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for several years , however , the U@@ PP has been getting increasingly under fire after several reports on har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted an article from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria for &quot; civil war &quot; defined by the Geneva Convention . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio , as a war , also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to employ means and paths that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; confused spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio still suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week later , the police cleared the hill with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; amid all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of gun@@ shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : learn to use besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad &apos;s regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around a million Syri@@ ans in Damascus and surrounding suburbs , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of Assad &apos;s regime has been committed on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebels have been under si@@ ege outside Damascus , causing people to rely on local or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics will teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not part of the traditional food grown in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , in agreement with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding @-@ platform cand@@ o . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to medi@@ ate 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , like Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € but will continue to collect donations to cand@@ o until Monday , the 4th of September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the scar@@ city of fuel , locally produced supplies are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; before veri@@ fying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom @-@ farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the start of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout eastern G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger move .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ supply by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) to acquire new foods . &quot;
creating new jobs especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea across the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of October 15 and 16 . this led to the fact that the government last week called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region of Gal@@ icia in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 frac@@ tures in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande occurred a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ ani ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos are spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the happ@@ enings :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Bund der Landwir@@ te of Portugal declared the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday , they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire . &quot;
&quot; in Lei@@ ria &apos;s forest a similar tragedy would have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are examined in places with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the turning form , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val direc@@ ts in the same article of the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , gradually spread to fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; these problems add that the website of the civil protection of Portugal , on 15 and 16 October , looked for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil defence data using the f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was created in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of fire brig@@ ade and , in this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was crucial that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits . &quot;

&quot; in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; at dawn , the boy was to break . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ g@@ boats .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ oo , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe . &quot;
the Taliban @-@ known Taliban were getting closer and closer to their hatred for the Haz@@ ara .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found herself in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars heavier than himself , to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot;
&quot; there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon before the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ a left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to patients twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high rating quot@@ as , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can take months for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation are dependent on the hospitality of friends , or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined desire of life helped A@@ shar@@ a to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ a stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food @-@ desk .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , a number of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , among them tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience , where the wa@@ iters and the staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her journey to Italy thanks to the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; but A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers , and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also for@@ ging plans for the opening of a Kab@@ ul plant in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop surplus products on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian parliament scrut@@ in@@ izes a draft bill , suggest@@ ing that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of a successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name as well as their ID number . &quot;
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty Members of Parliament , is currently present to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the parliament filed a legislative proposal in which har@@ sh@@ ly pun@@ ishments were introduced to ins@@ ult the president or senior officials . &quot;
&quot; under the legislative proposal , however , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ line a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he acted as an Egyptian polic@@ eman while demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against military coup plot@@ ting against the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; for more than 700 protest participants , Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the head of the prison according to human rights groups failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty because of one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do burden of , among other things , arms possession , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ ici@@ des . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iza free the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the sanctions of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activ@@ ist ce@@ ases to document sent documents
&quot; in May Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been inter@@ rog@@ ated to a continuous action plan . this plan stems from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly provides a controversial legal draft , which would grant business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , if they return all un@@ just@@ ly received mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; this document , published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential schemes are to support the legislation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the designation of his sources stating that article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared at the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Bureau of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before writing or sharing messages in social media . &quot;
the rules also indicate that registration will be required with the full name .
analysts believe that by doing this elimin@@ ates the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks within social networks . it is unclear until now how authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; in the social media , Chinese citizens have proposed legislation only sel@@ ectively to protect citizens &quot; journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as the &quot; organis@@ er of the information distribution &quot; at the provincial government . &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the identification of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ d@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has Wikipedia Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey supported the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication had been shut down , the site was closed because it was &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to address a political slan@@ der campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with increased surveillance capability that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies related to the proposal , but has provided other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
