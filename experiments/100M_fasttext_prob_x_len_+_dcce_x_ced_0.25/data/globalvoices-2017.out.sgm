<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American films, have danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was captivated.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was like that the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very mischievous love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declaring his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in multitudes for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes that he won with the Republican Elections, was the highest figure that a candidate nominated by the Party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Programme, perceives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the world view also did not correspond with the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Intolerance also contrasts with generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were still Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump sums up his way to the nominated republican candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for dump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, I almost broke the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters than racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to fit people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for dump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" whitelash "(NB. Ü): so much like" lamenting the whites against all other ethnicities "; the white and whiplash word game, which means the great Van Jones, has killed precisely what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever beliefs or background you may have, America is welcome to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your Americas?" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices heard louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"he received a unanimous and loud" "NO" "!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan was chatting with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later, he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this is my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">"the" "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" "by Catania, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC."</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Guerrero community in the Province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaan city of Catania?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the rubbish</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, the La banda de música (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members are very serious about their obligations to the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca nvi writes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they are always laughing and shining with glittering eyes and playing trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is located practically on the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprocessed instruments made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chavez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that all were made out of the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Catania, recalls the early times:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage, the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed as Favio, something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra consisting of instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Catania, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that battles raging illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known back then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia, before it searched the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal law of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to punish one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything", "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior manager of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of looting the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which has crossed criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries established in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"alongside Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the Premier out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are like and work together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, leader of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is trapped is hidden and it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">"by deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species should be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also controlled by the Schneckentempo with the information between individual countries, actions are happening nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also pursues the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships which fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered, such as those who indicate that a ship will load his caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal giver."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are opposed to illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their ports."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses to the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also assists FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to regain estimated USD 20 million in lost turnover, which the eight members of the network HISH-i lose every year due to the illegal fisherman who invade East African waters every year."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world. among these also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include acts like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of imaginations, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system", "says Long."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Come to me." and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">"up to now, the closed front functions."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed forged licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">Builds a system that is designed to help FISH-i to detect suspicious vessels more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal vessels that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO, which also deals with fishery data and FISH-i offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be localized by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is said to help FISH-i to find criminal vessels with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence African nations on this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO sky Truth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, Skytruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each traceable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing - that simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships which had formerly been fished without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile reached a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fishing boats have bought more licences ever since."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on the towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also note these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappeared annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there, six countries joined together in 2015, to the West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "surely the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report his first great triumph: in October, it was Greko 1, a ship running under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">"after the Venezuelas government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country fell into the void, having gathered on the streets."</seg>
<seg id="158">"under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found."</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country, including the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>
<seg id="160">"the political and economic situation of the country is deteriorating continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute shortage of food and medicine."</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but in the end the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the election campaign Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of Democratic unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, urged the demonstrators to join a mass rally for the support of the National Assembly in 2015 and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan Governments, should continue to block the referendum."</seg>

<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">"for 34 years, he retained the secret of the family."</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation back then I believed that was alright.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magician.</seg>
<seg id="207">"as a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father."</seg>
<seg id="208">"at that time, I could not see that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in the prison La Perla from 1976 to 1978."</seg>

<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has one parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">"when my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts."</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole and you are looking forward to one of the ERP systems.</seg>

<seg id="229">'There the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clump of silver inside it."</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are being tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I approached and saw a couch tortured on people.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a bed and a metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, overtake him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was appalling... like a dirty windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">"later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a human being can harm another so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">I was aware that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied together with handcuffs and were brought back to the eye."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian, who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying face downwards - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people still have a silent on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What guckst thou so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"" "why have you brought me before?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I was aware that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero put together a man and killed.</seg>

<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this road and were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanizing.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement from above came to be laid."</seg>

<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspiratorial in this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay me on the burden of what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="300">They could have simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why did their bodies disappear?"</seg>

<seg id="346">Original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in Kyoto in Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre where you can prolong its driving license, in the last month witnessed a very blissful translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a sign, the Japanese word was phoned by the" "older motorist", "the" "older driver", "falsely - perhaps also with malicious butt, and # 8212, translated as a" "terrible motorist." ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation from 1 to 20 September was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">"edited by Joshua Levine, who has been widely shared in social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware that the local newspapers were aware of it."</seg>
<seg id="352">The paper published in Kyoto Shimbun writes:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," Holmes said. "</seg>
<seg id="356">"the incorrect English translation was initially removed. the term" terrible drivers "was later replaced by the appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct designation" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto police force apologized for the translation mistake. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely apologize that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">"the Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt a bit more in detail with the phenomenon of" "terrible" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "terrible" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, which are involved nationally in accidents, is quite a reason for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents by seniors in 2005. this equates to a proportion of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens 1,803 of total 11,850 accidents caused."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen during the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">The named reporter published in the version of the article published on Yahoo presented comments to the light that show what preconceptions some Japanese people seem to have toward older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">"the article on Yahoo, on the translation error, received the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "is that (" "dreadful motorist" ") not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"-" "So faulty is the translation not at all, isn't it?"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, one needs two important skills: passive language skills in order to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally speaking is the belief that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which may translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translation, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English is considered the best, becomes a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and mysterious propositions arise, which arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints, which often embellish T-shirts and bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more thorough translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the City of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source for its translation."</seg>

<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that VPITV and El Capitolio TV websites were no longer accessible."</seg>
<seg id="394">"other online stations also survived recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups, resisting the Nicolás Maduros government."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the link was capped, and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="404">"the local NGO VEsinusit later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible through a closure of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online channels. this also applies to the Internet page at which the National Assembly carries out its meetings."</seg>
<seg id="405">"earlier research by the Institute of Press and Society (IPC), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond to certain domains faulty."</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a critic published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">"the article is part of a series entitled" Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que CAEN "(" Flying Cows, Moving Schools "), edited and re-published by Global Voices Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"the one that has become something," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she became ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, there are more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers her minors-year-old son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, an education and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay for countless days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and mistreatment - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be raised."</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke to Criadil. - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name because the feeling of gratitude, which is vaccinated in the Criadita, generally keeps silence."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, which is their daughter in believing that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves", "surpasses to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family assimilates the girl and justifies his exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon occured in the secret of paraguayan households, but a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira reached Marín with a stick until they suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest letters and demanded that there would be no further Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos was widely spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay there are more cows as children registered," Tina Alvarenga complained. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">"without official documents, it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live."</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to murder the girl who was her Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be trend-setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">"the Cripartas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the farm where her father worked, had to register and her father lost his work."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to work all and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market, to make money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to split the time so that she still had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, it cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner it was done with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food." "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the householder than eating out of the fridge," she recalls. "</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>
<seg id="469">"at some evenings, the manager Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read Editorials from the opposition newspapers such as" "Sendero" "or" "El Pueblo". ""</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince her not to believe the reports of the official media about the dictator regime.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to a bill on "the regulations on the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "on the basis of the law, there would be a place that is assigned to give citizens a permit to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a cash transaction."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application, which runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are able to impose registration on users who do not register, given the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyadh Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and Promoter of the Legislative Decree, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and a password to come through the firewall blocked by Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity, to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not yet been known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" "lead researcher" ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights" "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously then it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities, and also to bring them to a court case."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but everything is possible in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be passed on as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Legislative Assembly and the constitutional committees, before it goes to the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" is in line with a pro-military mindset in the parliament, in whose senses the control is maximized and ensured that no different narration is present on the image area, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="524">"this article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions."</seg>
<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq, the animal conservationist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working on protecting the ghostly Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subtype of the larger family of leopards, which strike through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular species of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and the growth of the ecosystem will also depend on a big predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a picture of a big cat in the camerafalle, Raza breaks out in pure pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a trained biologist, Raza likes to show passionate about another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict."</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies for wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the" "triple catastrophe" "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture has been a state-of-the-art prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami that originated from it."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring fectures Fukushima and Iwate have been evacuated, as the tsunami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"still, the prefecture of Fukushima had a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned substitutions (due to Quatai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by makeshift shelters (the" "casetsu juutaku" ") was forced to relocate to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the catastrophe of the Dreifach catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuation systems, who were hauled after the disaster in shelters, were moved to final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to establish, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by the disaster, opened their doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, have been largely impassioned."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of destroyed arable land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are only 690 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far removed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only be 75 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe, nearly half of the inhabitants of the coast, it is difficult to find their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to be able to establish a complete picture, the paper brought up numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation."</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to find out more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="575">"as for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture,"</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only witnessed the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witnessing the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"between 160 000 evacuation of Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, moved to permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the 2017 stand, still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas, most of the evacuation systems, still in temporary shelters, are older than 50 years old. it is known that efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that are to be held in Tokyo 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane molds in all of Cuba opened the doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"the popular commune Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the Western cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no appreciable sugars on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane mills.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after planting, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its facilities, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some alternated the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">"others resigned and commute daily to the factories, which still grind."</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene recalls the fact that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than 1910 produced quantity."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer something new."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw a better time.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive they were unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report" Agriculture perspectives "by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>

<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>

<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulan Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this through Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop supervisors have brought mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio- and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop thus ends with the fact that the young participants learn topics like" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-perception, "or whatever comes into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because workshops were so popular, the team also collaborated with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsummitkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a road section in western Canada, on which nearly two dozen indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstar Hip-Hop Group who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"this way, they can grow and move ahead with our youth as well."</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have meant by the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers exactly what is on the menu, near the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Plastics models of the dishes" ") are exhibited by each dish that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">The customer sees these plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend now turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger Iinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sandy puru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic gerichten decorated mobile-tapes as shown at the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming increasingly more elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon-rogens are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" wow, cool, now can I decorate my cell phone with laughter? ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic weights can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, we also have paddies (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"further skurrile plastic courts can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter the hashtag # which has been the" "Schrashtag #". ""</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which devotes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" struggle against drug trade "in Mexico, the poorest and killed regularly appear only in statistics."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, little one looks at the bereaved or the communities who have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with the Drug Policies ") to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were involved in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only allows us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who is searching for secret tombs after his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews at just one single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed, to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>

<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta: "it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need an education."</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother who is here with me too.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but they don't pay them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">"where shall we get them?" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in Central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensational journalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I pass by newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) if he's big. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the" "heroic deeds" "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified, that they were" "incessant". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to argue that they will be spared from such tragedies, if they do not stir and be silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post" Four months extortion in the main city district: how a family has been plundered with threats. "in this she describes how armed criminals were forced to withdraw money from their business for month until they had destroyed not only the business, but also tore up their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"pain never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers also."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to cry. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the post "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, tortillas and make" "Chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy who consists of violence and had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks from his home, saw the bloody corpse of his father, shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence is mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the citizens' council for public security and the government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's Office had 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8,5 Mordes per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories live in the face of always new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to describe the complex information behind the failed war against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo).</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the tank truck dropped to the victim."</seg>
<seg id="828">"representative representatives described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinemas nearby, which was full of people who looked at the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses of burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned with recognition.</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lying on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years, the same Photo has been taped several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, although real but not related to tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters from the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses were drastically reported by atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "nobody stayed back to include corpses," "said a resident of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">"and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:"</seg>

<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>

<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of depreciation; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"further, personal comments such as this example falsely forge the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media, in order to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the lethal persecution of Rohingya Muslim Rohingya.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning detection, published by the United Nations described those who could flee wounds, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to major discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life are both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question, however, is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue, and thrusts the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, concern is that violent imagery readers and viewers are desensitizing and giving them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media seem to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experimenting with algorithms in order to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think deeply about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which actually can be derived from the context or in a completely improper way."</seg>

<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of" Untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last April 3, 2017, the march began with the Vatican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (People's Front for the Near Testing of the debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessors of the reconstitution of the debt also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people Puerto Rico demand that politicians, bankers, and government agencies responsible for debt will be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial review and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the German CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of published books within three to five days, published excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available here license-free, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built and what is the real cost associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on site to look over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create something meaningful from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the list of the Adra Prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title" "Collective Memories" "gives his friends and his family a voice expressing his freedom and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel from the Adra Prison, a non-military establishment, was transferred to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the" "military police" "bassel had taken on the basis of a" "strictly secret" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that it was contacted by people on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insiders to the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his place of residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the manager of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more predictable than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"Bassel could not know at that time that ten years after working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet finish this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life, dreaming of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace it."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a prosabal she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique was reacted with anger against corruption, in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants in 2010 with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was to Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on 19th April."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to get back to his old post, because the company did not undertake any disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not welcome the action."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Center for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently kept silent and did not adopt appropriate legal steps for the application of the appropriate functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" disgusting ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been approved."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could keep paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director had no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself at the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself had become tired of this man, which was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machiel, to remember that a thief belongs to the prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel not only to remember the Mozambique Channel, but also as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, cutting-edge and - by the way - prophetic speakers."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Burmese word" "Kalar pae" "means chickpeas or bacon."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took off their posts from the web because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin, or generally used as adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or is the" "one" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abusive connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today, Kalar may be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call out hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts in order to express their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmesan words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (Camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' like:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a spiritual way, whether they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very much but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook ought to be more analytical before it deletes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing to Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post, and check it by checking the words side by side."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Hins" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, have received quite a good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship by keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative notation of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word" Kalar "was banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch, post and share content for 24 hours because the mail" "did not meet the Facebook community standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a number of people's posts that have no negative intentions or simply try to demonstrate their opinions against hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the initiative began, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and thus prohibited the words like" "chair" "or" "Erbsencurry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits would have given them a big sales, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate speech, but nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat an inheritance curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"just to check if Facebook removes the mail, which contains the word Kalar."</seg>

<seg id="1334">"the post states" If you are a doctor, then do you heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with approval.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in Myanmar communities, especially in Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to bring out the proliferating hate speech on its Burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of censoring the word" "Kalar", "it would have been better to look at the context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>
<seg id="1340">In Trinidad & # 038; Tobago is ending with the children's marriage</seg>

<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the Parliament has unanimously approved a law banning this practice so that the age-ready age is now 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"prior to this change in marriage, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere because age does not determine age."</seg>

<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the percentage of children already married to 15, in Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements which endeavoured to abolish laws on the child-marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition made tension in this really uncomplicated thing, and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill at all."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent self contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:"</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and no one decided against it."</seg>

<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">"I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father, that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be."</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately began to crackle pictures!!"</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyneys and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that because of social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should ignore the norm to keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha and rejected by her family and community after she had addressed a married relative with her name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives is also not known by their names, is also common among men. however, they have far less warrants to fear, if any, they should not come to this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district of Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, played a unique club and became quickly the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone in which they discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the community of Video Volunteers and is committed to the removal of patriarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years Rohini Paw has been working with the help of their video camera in the discovery of practices, such as children's council to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in her panel discussion, was of women who do not call her husbands to name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem that women could easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not saying the names of their husbands loudly, is a custom that they are all obligated and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not keep this is considered a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent until the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned around to me and said I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started its first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion in motion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she said all," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their husbands on their lips," "says Rohini Pawas of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the crushing of a centuries-old tradition in which married women should never pronounce the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she was only intimidating during the whole exercise, another decided to let the whole frustrated frustration come out against him and his family by curtailing him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the rush of adrenalin, having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received numerous reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing a zinnoberred dot on the forehead that shows the spouses:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the blinking point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing on him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves to not wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip on any discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to make sure who could hear what could be heard," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example our identities attached to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salone-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of her own choice of clothes, morality linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurts (upper shirts) into a panel discussion, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed somewhat, Rohini confirms that things come slowly into the roll:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear ZinnoberRed on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hedge for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a sacrifice of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of Liu Xiaobo, imprisoned in Chinese, has drawn attention to the international community after he had announced his lawyer at the end of June that he was hospitalized in the hospital for liver cancer."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years" imprisonment for "" subversion "," having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China. "</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as" an internal affair, "and says a spokesman, he considered it" not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country. "</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries criticized the stringent treatment of the pair in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to give Liu a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway in a nutshell</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs Børge Brende refused to answer questions about his release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway fell into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was conferred to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to restore the salmon exports to China since the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"having spread the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to rid Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants."</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the message agency AFP announced on June 27 that the message prompted Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the request of the U.S. embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the utterance of the State Department that" "no country has the right to intervene in isolated and irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to impose the Chinese government on it, Liu and his wife unconditionally released."</seg>

<seg id="1666">McCallum says further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including free speech, and release those permissions to exercise these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - Germany</seg>

<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished, had led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmuamalgam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the conference on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody asked if New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "reverse the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons led by Shanmucus were not very nobel: he was defending an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal jurisdictions', in view of this, he seemed inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently managed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre of authoritarian rulers again emerges who pretend to be democrats, abandons the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers to his American guests in the last week of Shanmucus were really non-answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our judiciary, our political system."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarried the corresponding questions with non-answers rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmucus to clarify his opinion, since it did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our cheap K Shanmuamalgam would take the effort to clarify this point unless he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points to the criticism that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmucus's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was more a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneasy even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was" "no country", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmucus, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmuamalgam, a member of the new generation of political leaders in Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes, correctly associated and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks down the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmuamalgam have committed a mistake or was it a Freudian advocate?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally countryside and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the cabinet of government, the statements of Mr. Shanmuamalgam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore pay their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our Prime Minister pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink employee identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and was always a town:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear testimonies like" the defense of the country, "etc., but that is not quite right."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices recently asked his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect in your home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">"your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumours about certain parts of the world will be exposed and another facet is to be shown."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I'll answer. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live and live in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered to be a polite to show interest in his interlocutor, asking for personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification is usually followed by the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians may boil inwardly against anger when they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know, there is little that differs Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages are legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">"all seem to think, Canada is so great."</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter if you would change me like Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the postmark "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, being 'nice' is basically to be fun - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and not to earn attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a majority of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders describe as "nice" is perhaps just chilly politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I am connecting with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">"luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just" "nice". "our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy."</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that transcodes the Junta, which in 2014 seized power and, in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">"the new song" "Dictator Girl" "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what rules his girlfriend makes."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video relates indirectly to the continuing military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The dictator "in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the drafical section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision-making on important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program for" recruitment of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons who are seen as critics by the junta. "</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was also set up in the army that supervises online contents and prosecutes people accused of being denied the monarchy, prosecuting criminal law."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets out a strict case against "Lese Majeste."</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"one of the problems the junta continued to pursue is its decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payers."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery vehicle before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are imprisoned, because they allegedly caused" confusion "in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile, the teaser of the song was showing members of the band, who imitated the Salut" The Tribute of Panem, "which was already used by Putsch opponents during the 2014 protests."</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico "Mama Africa" houses migrants on their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border between Mexico and Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula. it is located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear."</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is named Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bald, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez, the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some of them slept already outside on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with their daughter Merrui who has a yoghurbeard) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move toward the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans are often travelling the route and that Africans speak already at Whatsapp of Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy grew weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money necessary to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Frau Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "he replies, smiling." "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ramírez mentions that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them, or to tell her about the course of her journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explained that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have seen what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he was asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, the travelers always consult their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she blets in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there's one of her daughter with African hair stains she made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she puts her briefly in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats it every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, who received the"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities did not use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would investigate and track the sources and distributions of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans, and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "may enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict regions, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet on Twitter based media outlet" Images from In China "(which has taken the censored news in China), the censored news published in China, showed photos from a checkpoint on which policemen randomly checked out if they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile message required that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the production technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"furthermore, a Jingwang product description, which highlighted that the software can record the password request of a Windows operating system, and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are converted into electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos ". however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1995">"far away from our blue virtual world, you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identifiable, both internally and externally."</seg>
<seg id="1997">One who makes honor to her name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has knocked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality recovers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters are transformed into beings from flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will become aware of your existence, even if the Earth is on the axis of disaster. you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they have arrested me and my father three times, but that didn't suffice to make" my lesson, "as the chief of the security servant formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>
<seg id="2004">"it sufficed, so that the city smiled the darkness of the night with" "Allahu Akbar" "writing."</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all quarters of the city sought after, only my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, no rain, at the wrong time, even if I did not put high demands on a city that is fed to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night things had a calming effect, after the power supply in the neighborhood ceased to function."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I broke the silence, crying out several times" Allahu Akbar "from my house roof."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisted by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">"a few minutes later, some of my friends felt courageous enough to work together."</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, real friends joined me; we allied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely and completely."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you are aware that you fret the spirit out of the lamp, but it just doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "get ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow you - nothing can give you back your voice, after you have cried out all the way to the office of security service out of the body."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"the Oberst Ghassan stood there with several of his men, my father was already there, as I am now."</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Oberst Ghassan begins to say:" "let me also hear, how you shout 'Allahu Akbar', or you are only brave enough to scream if we are not nearby."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His fiduly-filled eyes focused on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you are afraid to look into my eyes, and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity; perhaps at the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I replied: "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I have never ceased to look into your eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2030">The stench of this accursed sentence is still in my nose until today.</seg>

<seg id="2032">I walked through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I carry with myself.</seg>

<seg id="2036">"unlike otherwise, they probably have assigned me a larger cell this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with only one other prisoner, and I must immediately sit down without waiting for her permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I grabbed an old tried-and-tested communication method: hitting the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my cell rade was a" "prisoner". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he answered me in the end.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was an elderly man of middle age, who looks similar to me and called" the doctor. ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, there are no distinctive imbalances in me, and doctors do not exist here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone, whose voice sounds like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells.</seg>

<seg id="2055">"thus, the secret was vented: to protect the security against us and prevent us from exposing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they spoke in the alawitic dialect - so they played their confessional press card and betrayed the close view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"this is not a house here, it is not a land; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I supervised the auditorium and meet at Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me like that."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he catches a" pleasant "conversation, despite the facial expressions that derail him:" my boy, you are still young, you can begin to close this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can no longer say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication after a friendly conversation for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to make this penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2064">At punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner attaineth at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot compete with him, and you cannot hold your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams weren't enough for him yet why they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself if the investigator had previously worked as a collector, or if that belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables intertwined in order to present us the, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within a single hour three of them changed, while I was still on the line."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the hangman remarked the cooling down and didn't find any favours, why he was next to an electrically charged bar."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed whole body, enough to supply my entire quarter."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my semi-naked body, which lay stretched on the floor, was the perfect power manager."</seg>

<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to go to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed which happened to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "Raus with you, asshole."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhaustive youth:" "my Lord, my father must be fearful."</seg>

<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking and can witness with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he won a special aversion against American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib views his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion is for those trying to survive in war zones, something with his identity as a" Palestinian refugee from the second generation. "he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so, because of my own living circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a human, "while in water soldered Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the mugs talk warm coffee and the rake of the Kent-cigarette in the nose first line of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you have a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in public during Ramadan, to drink water - not to land in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some of the MPs who support the Islamic Campaign's Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual inception Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert night."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputies and former press spokesmen in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahavenb said in an interview with CNN, that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the well-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to stand for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be simply rhetoric, but indeed an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan reflected in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in the year 2016, Hdaib returned to Leibe by traditional sex-men, having completed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently low-married woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of" "Honour mordes" "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still difficult to support Jordan's institutional infrastructure to support women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a crime against crime from 1954, women, who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence, may be imprisoned at indefinite time in prison, and their release often requires a long-term bureaucratic effort, as well as the guaranty of the family that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also, Hdaib's music is very popular and is known to not shy away from subjects that long as taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions on sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics narrated to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song called "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is also."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can, in his words," "get what you want" "- whether it's faith or non-belief, hetero or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of homosexuals and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been critically censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online programme Roya to remember that his comments were torn, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a modified version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuclear, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuys, who later worked on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do this?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, did nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Haitian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression, and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service identified several former members of the government and members of the teachers' association, with the rationale that they were critically appalled in comments in social media, related to the deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg; the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila a performance for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it sees Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams, and artificial democracies. at least he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue, and consequently resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big and extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing have marched over more than a thousand years to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emissism, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to snap a few great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is difficult to imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two floats are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true one - and a stunning way to spend the summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"" "Yattemare" "!"</seg>

<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing a growing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming increasingly more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can train these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there experts confront each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the hairdressing salon, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the revised version of the article entitled" Love messages to guerrilla fighters, "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel expelled, accommodating affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question was no longer a question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga of the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of historical events and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the Guerillabewegung FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombian people, however, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillacev, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, had been subjected to war rhetoric and carried out their arms around the clock, must now be integrated into life as a civilian."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now enter into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters in order to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, which should then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters of reconciliation was created at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, which needed most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story into a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Authorities of Cali and Leonardo von der BogotArt traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were up as they had done before in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it is unbelievable how many different feelings can be passed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between, "told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed over the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters lived) I saw a guerilla fighter, who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Grenade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him," "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "he answered," "I will answer a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful, that's why I reply." suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and set me beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the beginning, students and some of the FARC leaders joined a panel discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already at war and the FARC already agitated in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have seen how social injustice emanated from the state to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape the society in this country more equitable. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear those people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I've often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings, which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"for example, Gustavo González, the camp commandant of the camp at Caldono-Cauca, wrote in the example of the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after disarming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people ready to attack arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now sit on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat posed like a Damoclesworth over the LGBTQ community is not only created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya took over the international headlines several months ago, after reports were published that themed the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she shed light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspected queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced by the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear around her life, she ultimately moved to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos from my documents through the whole WhatsApp got the round."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just taking out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long will you return the family, you Shock-stain? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called for an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung wings."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there's my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, sign me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to return to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they put absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender that everything was bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You brought a monster to the world not only your family but the entire republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mom became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors arrived and rescued them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering me, without ID, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe, you're in security just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person they remember from their past - so to my male shape."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed away?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who received a month and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not join a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end ask for proof that the so-called" "honour" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are still gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle Kadyrow's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know they are held there, so that they can later be presented as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show off their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">You understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, they were specifically submerged in order to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was no news from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports about it so far. however, we assume that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I wore my hair forever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003 I was already known all over Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In serious!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was true, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia, originally, wanted to bring us back to the" Civilization, "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia never hurt me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theater in Grosny, there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"they often say to children, when they make fun of the sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just shut their eyes closed to you, because they believed they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never hunted, and never smitten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"those who had laughed and laughed beforehand, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could sense how the situation in the Republic was getting worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I still work as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacups, meetings, I join them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up breeding places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to whitewash you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bobbins with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestan who, the Cabardines have which, the Russians also have the ones; on the whole planet, they are - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think of transitions to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be exact, different ways of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not harm me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestor region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>

<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August returned the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to have the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Talagawa hospital in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the combustion engines were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patters, who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families and doing a safe job due to the persecution of the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Ahwazi suffers from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large proportion of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Empire took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing only slowly, and the local population is getting little from that wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas, where the provinces are Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsening the devastation caused in the region, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are searching for a job, completed 55% of a secondary school, and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy" aimed at exterminating the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor of human rights activist in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"due to this, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persects and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process is a combination of a high number of new ethnic perspires and anti-Arab discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be employed, as even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and gaining knowledge of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be feminist in general."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, in spite of equal education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and societal standards still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and denominations."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer double and threefold among them."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I get to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black female women, on black female women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"nevertheless, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their voices "and" Kumbaya, "my Lord to sing," to achieve equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist motivating violence, that we are exposed to black women in two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"in addition, black women and women of other ethnic and ethnic origin deserve less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership, than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in whose center is the white woman who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers to both the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white feminist oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech," "Am I not a woman?" "and I refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is an unmended and marginalized being in historical terms."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give a home to women of different backgrounds and to distinguish themselves from the white feminism, the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to dissolve myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which is so persistent for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana uranism: Reclaiming ourselves (e.g.: Africa-Womanismus: how we ourselves recen ourselves) we can also create spaces where they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which constitute the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can thrive in an environment in which my life has neither escaped, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddle against pollution: a man's mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine devoted to international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern throughout the region of Kurdistan in Iraq. his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his community."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we lost when I was a child," Musa tells. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the Non-Governmental Organizations of Waterkeepers Iraq, a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive then? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker in Erbil, Iraq, and multimedia journalism."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work is on the following, little noticed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with whose help oppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article" "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" "by Electural. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilicheinefraubin), which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a Police Commissioner said Ada Báez, that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman Balbuena showed for abuse, the acute indication of Ada Báez did not help."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman returned her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women first permit an ad, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"accounting Watings and Statistical 2 Invisible Missions and a Legal System, which does not subnimmt3 Paraguays Law: good approach, flawed implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay." "there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay", "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the available figures are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 displays of domestic violence began with the District Prosecutor's Office. 70% of this was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads reported by the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 adverts due to domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of the ads of women came here too.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "to any woman who counts in Paraguay for psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do so."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"for any woman who refuses for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuses and a judicial system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want it, but then she still wanted to regret it. she should regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she wore psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women would be submissive, because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he said rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen ill of Carlos for so long, and didn't leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse should at least have a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner mistreated them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorian's case, everything began with psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner even managed to convince them that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements in the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a process against her former partner, who developed into an impermeable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays Law: good approach and flawed implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, known as the hashtag # Porellas (# fürst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiunaMenos (# Not EineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain Femdomly to an independent alleged offence and punish harshly as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the text was changed to a number of points in order to win even the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is banned, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill provided the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs, which have to bear the victims of violence at the present time, if they just want to allow an ad and get a safe place to stop the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">"Echauri argues that the law is not effective, if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:"</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, abuse as part of human relationships is seen."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal."</seg>

<seg id="2589">"for the need for medical research performed on-site, there are two reasons: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the supply of the global health care system, which cover the specific medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outright, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question, how many types of lettuce he can get, limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered on more and more plants, such as grain or cartons. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition morton still breeds lettuce, but it takes longer since its work becomes more and more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if in a river there would be a boulder that I must yodel.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in front of judgment, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he has also joined a movement that becomes ever greater in the USA and throughout the world: open Source Breeding (" "Open Source" "breeding)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman oat of the sort Outside gorgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement originates from the IT department and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" "Open Source" "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" "open source" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit to others to freely use the seeds that they have bred."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open Source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately to select them - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emerified professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">Independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the open-source movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." anyone who wants to buy good, local and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is offered in August and September 2016, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that others continue to provide their seeds free of charge, in contrast to patent seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are not such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby assume that large-scale plants such as wheat are patented in an even bigger style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they have targeted features - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and hold threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders will diminish more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more important than ever since the changed conditions are far worse predictible due to climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property is owned by other breeders, since" patents and the protection of plant-varietal innovations promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, it promotes it by providing more material and expertise available to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight already."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes with the concept of developing plant characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, Plant breeders in the US-state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" whoever breeds a variety also breeds its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides, which cultivates in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (those who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject patents, or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeder by avoiding plant patenting would be more innovative:" it looks like me with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my rivals will sell my grades in a few years." "he says." "with a patent you are protected for 20 years before competition, which makes it really easy for my opinion." "worldwide response"</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly across the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also assists them to come to "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organisation Agrecol works on an open source license, which ultimately forms a formally and legally binding form of OSSI obligations for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"regulations for breeding differ from country to country, so the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for" Open Source "seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, which should be scheduled for scheduled next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, has published a report of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link from the Luby of OSSI hopes that there will soon be more people to recognize it."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have barely played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make clear to the people that there is even more left behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he talked about the student protests and took a video how police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mostly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself about blocking the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to block is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi's priority; and although the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible to give me the feeling of a siege. an arrest, an attempt to murder, summons at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I was working."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, even though only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post items to circumvent the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after having locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 web sites. this included technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"afte also documented the closure of providers, enabled by the move of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th, we noticed how the blocking of websites that offer VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is also worsened by the fact that the decisions of censorship are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian people have no legal basis by which they can proceed against these acts."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers throughout Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer killed in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves rob pharmacist with military weapons," "President Temp sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and Luftwafee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"thus, the newspaper" Extra "published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16, published the Editorial" This is not normal "in which it announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision expressed the paper like this:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"everything, however, deviates from civilised standards and what happens only in Rio will be published in the" "War in Rio" "section. (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rupture in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper continues:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, who first shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" have used more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argued that violence was a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning, as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">"it is owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has underlined the state's security policy for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the federal state Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by employing a massive police force."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. for several years, however, the UPP has been getting increasingly under fire after several reports on harassment and repression against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted an article from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria for" civil war "defined by the Geneva Convention."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio, as a war, also draws serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to employ means and paths that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "where civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape and the object for" collateral damage "and" confused spheres. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio still suffer."</seg>
<seg id="2788">"a week later, the police cleared the hill with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman."</seg>

<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these areas controlled by rebels have been under siege outside Damascus, causing people to rely on local or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>

<seg id="2810">"mushrooms are not part of the traditional food grown in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>

<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"due to the scarcity of fuel, locally produced supplies are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "production of fungal seeds from the regions" "before verifying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of October 15 and 16. this led to the fact that the government last week called out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the region of Galicia in Spain where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fractures in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, Pedrógão Grande occurred a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">"all Portugal is burning in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata (@ a _ atani) October 15, 2017"</seg>

<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was not able to curb the scale of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Bund der Landwirte of Portugal declared the Público newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">"this Sunday, they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire."</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in Leiria's forest a similar tragedy would have happened in June, as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits are examined in places with high fire risk."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the turning form, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open backdoor so that everything could be built," João Sorval directs in the same article of the paper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of easily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, gradually spread to fires of this species."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these problems add that the website of the civil protection of Portugal, on 15 and 16 October, looked for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil defence data using the fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was created in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of fire brigade and, in this fateful weekend in October, was crucial that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban-known Taliban were getting closer and closer to their hatred for the Hazara.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"some days after his escape, Asharaf found herself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars heavier than himself, to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon before the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Ashara left his life without documents in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to patients twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that due to relatively high rating quotas, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can take months for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation are dependent on the hospitality of friends, or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained desire of life helped Ashara to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of work in the construction industry, Ashara stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food-desk.</seg>

<seg id="2912">"much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"according to official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"over the past few years, a number of Afghans have emerged, among them tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience, where the waiters and the staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>

<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"but Ashara's goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers, and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">"I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women."</seg>
