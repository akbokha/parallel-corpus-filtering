this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA was illeg@@ ally owned by Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
it describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA has literally transferred dra@@ fts to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified bre@@ aches and promp@@ ted him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern , to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courage@@ ous , they will reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters were doing before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they indicated years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped due to cracks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
&quot; instead of sh@@ aking and breaking cracks , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his phone @-@ remarks secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his loan agreement , and even rei@@ sen@@ ing with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower in his attempt to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all the US governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do so from the moment they contact us , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet been written , when fis@@ sur@@ es had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source repository for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective News Agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that thre@@ aten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to ensure that not only technology separ@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to present mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
or the next environmental co @-@ worker who strikes alarm for contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der who warned us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to firms like Fon@@ sec@@ a Mos@@ sack and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who wait for the next release and the next revealed documents .
&quot; now that sounds like the plot of an agent , or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel . &quot;
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in the whole world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets , something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people all around the world seem to be very conf@@ using , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always place it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is thing . &quot;
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have been no prominent Americans so far , who came to this sc@@ andal in these revel@@ ations . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , a sack of Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a le@@ ak from Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is the case that in some U.S. countries you need less information to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed staff of school districts to cur@@ b school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers have allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip especially prone investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator emerged as an African minister who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an isolated case .
it is not a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single leader , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could do nothing about it , as if nothing could ever have changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters at national level who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced legislation in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see other people hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do companies .
we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transpar@@ enz is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the boot of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after completing my design studies , I made a deposit sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps .
I invited him to a beer . he enthusias@@ tically told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping space now ?
&quot; but I just met him ! he says he would go to the Emergency Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in ? &quot;
a stranger sleep@@ er in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , che@@ eks to the door , and closed my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people , who were sold as strangers to me during childhood , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
&quot; let &apos;s make a jump of time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ agu@@ ely , my ro@@ ommate is pulling out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , with a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and so founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different because we made it for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell , Brian and I started . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent ?
things came into the rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ w@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; via the Internet , they can invite other strangers to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; when one has a problem , one contempl@@ ates the things that one can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like you to unlock your mobile phone .
share your un@@ locked cell phone to your left seating alco@@ ve .
this quiet touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locking phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests also feel if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only once , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name , if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked cell phones !
how would you feel when you &apos;d like to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens the trust .
&quot; in the beginning , we made some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait for both hosts and guests to leave their judgments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and residence . &quot;
surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if one has less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if one has more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request will not be accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family . &quot;
how to create it with design to make this level of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
&quot; what we did not expect was the great multitude of people , who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need that had not been covered previously . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business is going very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to party or devast@@ ated flats .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I think only about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
&quot; fortunately , the 123 million missed accommodations had only one fraction of a problem . &quot;
for men trust each other with justice .
&quot; when trust works , it can create wonderful things . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks because of sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it properly . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car into the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want one to be lonely , they pass books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the cause is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves and that changes everything .
&quot; if you travel today , this is comparable to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling was a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill a group there and show you one in a pub craw@@ l neighborhood of which you have never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from ground up to sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces belonging to the government , &quot;
were now offered to residents . students looking for a place to stay
&quot; were taught to people whose children were und@@ ressed , incub@@ ator programs were launched , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new startups in the Share Economy . today , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreig@@ ner or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also a lot of hospitality .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I think that amaz@@ ingly , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da drives past me .
we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you see me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show that the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
= = = &gt; P@@ yp@@ s = = &gt; Fu@@ ji@@ war@@ a
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born this way . &quot;
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure I was 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only accept the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read him , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and eventually believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was confident and slow to deep@@ en with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves you ? &quot;
that is how it feels .
&quot; later , I married and started like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; express message . &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jump@@ ed from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock turned quickly into indign@@ ation .
why should we do something like this ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the n@@ u , the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to go to a new city and start building post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove -- when we drove sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; this night we moved to our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; P@@ ie in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot;
I stayed within the whole week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; not this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and people who were considered Muslims , drag@@ ged and beat . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain themselves .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love matters . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the US &apos;s body .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , pro@@ sel@@ fers and Olympi@@ ics . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; it might keep a few parking spaces free , but not stop terror . &quot;
regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alisation process , one has found that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts are a brain @-@ la@@ under@@ ing , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add ourselves to the world of creation by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ one with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when you look at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; every cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man with whom she spoke , she sil@@ enced and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that their anger had made sense , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m re @-@ established the connection with God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of anxiety affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
a study -- actually several neuro@@ science studies -- show : if we fear it will happen at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian governance system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that when people submit messages that were neg@@ atively reported on Muslims , they rather agreed to military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at the mood against Muslims from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
&quot; in the assignment of collective debt , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when has my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , has murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had visited in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he was fired eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
&quot; we talked about it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we wanted to leave to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely practise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we rode silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and took off my shoes , and went into the hall , and what I saw was restra@@ ined . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy with panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on the phone number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thank you !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : well , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might claim that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , work in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity to the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ package setting penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting air units , air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ ance load@@ able structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences , and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must be collec@@ tively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board determine what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands can be found on the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flying device that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ences like wind bu@@ cks .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
date : 06 / 14 / 2009
&quot; during our research , we often introduce fundamental abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter . &quot;
&quot; such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mobile parts , which meet to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled air@@ planes , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
recently we discovered that flies with just one .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ section , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside @-@ life happens very much so that it can fly st@@ ably and move across the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star . in order to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the most important skill , &quot;
&quot; moving in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ p . &quot;
&quot; some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly by flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at it .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must become extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
it turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller is falling , the electronics or a battery - can fly the machine further , even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by doing a half of fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a palette of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercially available Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine along the way would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types like us , wages are in development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular fashion . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars along in all galax@@ ies throughout the Universe known universe .
it was a very big boy .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; first , let us arrange the events in a timely manner . &quot;
it was 1.3 billion years ago that there was a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God reig@@ ns at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided to build particularly brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which develop through col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them considered them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved the detection rate . &quot;
this is why it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to clarify some minor problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the det@@ ectors were commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes rus@@ hed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , this was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and her by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a fragment in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ ew@@ ed into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative , lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often perform a properly al@@ ber@@ ent dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and du@@ ve , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous , are . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched by us at the meeting of the waves . the elong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is to say 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described hunting after the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are resour@@ c@@ eful and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite handy , because so you can customize a picture or map of things by moving the light around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in the case of sounds , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
the face of your child about .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now is talking about Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot do simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the All literally speaking . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gravity can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; if the two bodies turn very fast , you hear the same pen with an additional key change . this sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement pattern shaping into the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on September 14th 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o Fol@@ lowing : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; No@@ body , who knows what to hear , recognis@@ es this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let us think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the abi@@ ding meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes happen in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own gle@@ e . &quot;
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and most importantly , I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things that we have never seen , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring forth black holes , like Lig@@ o they observe , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the sour no@@ o@@ ks , so to speak , for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different angle of view to the events of the universe , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately to how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cling of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
are you dre@@ aming with us .
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , my fear removed . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; guess , I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from there I swear to always play with them , as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I understood completely , that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; legends to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think things out , stir up life . &quot;

I scre@@ am TV . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each program offers hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three shows simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of Television &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
&quot; in America , my series of television runs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who else does that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a titanium . &quot;

I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you are managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work , and it is true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream about a dream job . &quot;
&quot; everything is a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I go deeper into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , as I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as you can see a high sound , run a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the hum@@ ming . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever . &quot;
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am persu@@ aded to write that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she does . &quot;
&quot; but the hum@@ ming -- when I began working and working and making , building , creating and working , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy . the sum@@ mation ! &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sum@@ mation is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the sum@@ mation is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t strive for great@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; feeling that you can &apos;t be different than striving for great@@ ness , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ mation .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s going to be genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know I &apos;m not do@@ omed to fail , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more I expect . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sum . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the sum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single work institution .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my M@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; E@@ stim@@ ate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ anas .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ m ceased . &quot;
the sum@@ ming of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sums didn &apos;t come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , re@@ worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , no re@@ mor@@ se , no re@@ mor@@ se , a titanium ring does not give up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
&quot; I was a Pre @-@ show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l you , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the hum@@ ming if you already knew the hum@@ ming , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern @-@ state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you play ? &quot;
and I want to say no more than to be aware of two things :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; estimated . &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; I hate it when I &apos;m titanium and my mar@@ sh mix , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can do nothing except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity are .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me is solving .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that does not happen immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming comes back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ p@@ tuous , but a hum@@ ming . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no mystery . no secret . only love .
it is something we forgot .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um@@ men , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of programmes and TV sessions and how oper@@ able my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sums are not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums are dependent on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium bin ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice , as far as I want to hear the hum@@ ming again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not based on how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , for what kind of man prefer to be rather than home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always have access to my mobile phone .
NT@@ F &amp; C.@@ O.@@ N.@@ S. Co @-@ Star Â ®
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever listened to the games ?
you can also say yes ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; perhaps you keep me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit will replace me .
&quot; and talking to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for more . &quot;
&quot; everyone can take 15 minutes in the piece , even on a bad day ! &quot;
15 minutes per piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to deal with . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being oasis , my world . &quot;
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children .
&quot; to play &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I am leaving and I si@@ ege . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself in full 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the hum@@ ming came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy is pouring in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the sum@@ mation of life .
the sum@@ mation of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it is snow@@ ing to me that I am a titanium . I have never seen a titanium that is going to go to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the land I create , the marathon that I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming , the other , the correct sum : the sum@@ mation of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , captiv@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ mation , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think of things , I wake you up to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ am@@ like .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and for more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; neuro@@ sur@@ geons are very frustr@@ ating for us that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered under heavy trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at that time , I was a senior physician , working day and night in the emergency room . &quot;
often I supplied patients with skull trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas sw@@ ells the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; in order to save life , you have to reduce the skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are immort@@ al . &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain @-@ herd @-@ cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
that was what we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we met them at the receiving table of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we shave these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we spread the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we found a violation and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were rei@@ m@@ eri@@ zed .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we cultivate in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take fe@@ ed@@ p@@ ellets from one tablet .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we passed the motor sensors field in the motor c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they spontane@@ ously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as in the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkeys relaxing spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we spread the cells : the same monkey , two months after the expl@@ ant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that was also very exciting for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ete them with human beings .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to conduct this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we don &apos;t see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but rather as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable ti@@ red@@ ness .
we believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ ah@@ ors in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- made clear to me as finance minister in the euro group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or Communist Party of China , or some of my per@@ missible friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , along with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are painted , our future glo@@ omy , and w@@ asted our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of disappearance , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; all of us acknowledge the debt crisis , &quot;
but few recognize his twin @-@ twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy sa@@ vers and corporations , who , however , are too timi@@ d to invest it where it would be productive and to produce income that is urgently needed for humanity , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past three months in the United States , in England and in the euro area , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.@@ 4 Bil@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1@@ tril@@ lion US dollars , which lay around at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and ex@@ alt the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand , which , as in an endless loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , like in an endless loop , could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up , &quot;
un@@ inten@@ tionally causes the circumstances causing E@@ di@@ pus to kill him .
this is my Ha@@ dern with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance all of the technologies , &quot; green technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy of course included too many , of course . &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to under@@ mine the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it referred to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political participation with equal voting in questions of the state of state . &quot;
ath@@ en@@ ic democracy has not long held a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democr@@ acies have not roots in ancient Athens . &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- became a democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s democr@@ acies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , gradually sub@@ ver@@ ted politics and em@@ powered them . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not part of a de@@ generation of its DNA .
&quot; it is because it is possible to be in the government today and still not in power , because the power is immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my Ha@@ dern with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have dec@@ im@@ ated so sustain@@ ably the animals from which it nour@@ ishes , has dec@@ im@@ ated that at the end they are star@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the overall economic demand falls and the corporate directors are too fri@@ ghtened to invest in the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the w@@ asting of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and economics , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robot .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economics and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to transform the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ united division , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth .
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; in which the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; is used , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; to indul@@ ge in long discussions the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it be , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ good utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and income comes from revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no outstanding twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which she pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ anism , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ anian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a Matrix - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... Do we do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transmission of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is thoroughly relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , therefore , I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely ver@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you consider from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the perception of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what we can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to blame China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells enormous after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greek finance ministers at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I agreed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and perpet@@ u@@ ating den@@ ial that a massive fault line has ex@@ pi@@ red through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European Group , have still chosen den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ or &apos;s side to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
&quot; they merely wanted to overthrow our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions passed through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that for 5 years they had been going through a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the Great Depression .
none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika imposed on us this policy was : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not survi@@ ving .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the free centri@@ sts will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to sm@@ ash the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be bear@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 medium @-@ sized minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is Managing Director at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair @-@ e@@ ater and refers to Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking up the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website , IMDB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review . &quot;
&quot; if your show is judged with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think one needs special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it makes more thoughts about the medium bul@@ ging , average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something so that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online , where they can watch everyone for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon releases things for nothing , do you use it , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are watched while watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or watch again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the Manager for Program Design from Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for this super show and he also uses data for it , but it makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a contest , he and his team have looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , i.e. the reviews they give to the shows whose history they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these small details about the spectators : which shows they like , what producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the pieces together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow says it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimized it by very powerful computer .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone here in the USA is in prison and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data &quot;
not always producing the best results . it is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data sealed companies are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the bad way , they can predict - by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year by year by year until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people use many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you basically do two things : &quot;
first you disman@@ tle this problem into your individual parts so you can analyze the items ; as a second place the items together again to make a decision .
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put pieces and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , then a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision about how to take all these parts back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they vie for TV ideas , than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; that &apos;s what the data tell us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just one tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
thank you ...
before there was data this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; it is also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will try it out later with a demo demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more wis@@ er than data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the building structure .
&quot; maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
