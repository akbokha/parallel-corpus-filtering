<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA was illegally owned by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">It describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA has literally transferred drafts to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified breaches and prompted him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern, to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous, they will reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters were doing before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they indicated years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped due to cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of shaking and breaking cracks, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his phone-remarks secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his loan agreement, and even reisening with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower in his attempt to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned more than all the US governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do so from the moment they contact us, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet been written, when fissures had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this technology is SecureDrop, an open source repository for whistleblower, originally developed by Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective News Agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot secretly procure information, and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that threaten us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to ensure that not only technology separators such as Edward Snowden have the opportunity to present misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental co-worker who strikes alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a Wall street insider who warned us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to firms like Fonseca Mossack and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who wait for the next release and the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">"now that sounds like the plot of an agent, or a John-Grisham novel."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in the whole world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and obscure their assets, something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people all around the world seem to be very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always place it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is thing."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans so far, who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle that these tax havens function, a sack of Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a leak from Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is the case that in some U.S. countries you need less information to give less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed staff of school districts to curb school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers have allowed scammers to rip especially prone investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator emerged as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an isolated case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single leader, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very trivial as if we could do nothing about it, as if nothing could ever have changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced legislation in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see other people hide their true identity behind pseudo companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy that stand up and say: "Intransparenz is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency through laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally end the intransparency that now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the boot of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after completing my design studies, I made a deposit sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he enthusiastically told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping space now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just met him! he says he would go to the Emergency Corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what did I rock in? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeper in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, cheeks to the door, and closed my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people, who were sold as strangers to me during childhood, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">When I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a jump of time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plaguely, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, with a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and so founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell, Brian and I started."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay for our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blewczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented the investors:" we would like to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"via the Internet, they can invite other strangers to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"when one has a problem, one contemplates the things that one can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your unlocked cell phone to your left seating alcove.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocking phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests also feel if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only once, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channeling for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name, if he had told whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really hold very well unlocked cell phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you'd like to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">"in the beginning, we made some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait for both hosts and guests to leave their judgments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if one has more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, as for example:" "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request will not be accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, e.g." Tolle works of art in your apartment! I make holidays with my family. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to make this level of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not expect was the great multitude of people, who were more than willing to put down these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that had not been covered previously."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is going very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to party or devastated flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I think only about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, the 123 million missed accommodations had only one fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust each other with justice.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, it can create wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to tend to heart attacks because of sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know it properly."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car into the hospital if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want one to be lonely, they pass books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay will expire."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but to call it simply" "rental industry", "the cause is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel today, this is comparable to Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling was a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visit, a group there would wait to fill a group there and show you one in a pub crawl neighborhood of which you have never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from ground up to sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relations, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught to people whose children were undressed, incubator programs were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new startups in the Share Economy. today, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also a lot of hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that amazingly,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show that the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">= = = &gt; Pyps = = &gt; Fujiwara</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born this way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," Why do you suppress yourself? ""</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, and compared to the pressure I was 17-year-old felt to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read him, thought, questioned, doubted, and eventually believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confident and slow to deepen with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever felt that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves you?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later, I married and started like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" express message. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..." "jihad...", "..." "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country that has been attacked, but in the nu, the deeds of others turned me into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to go to a new city and start building postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove -- when we drove silently -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"this night we moved to our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "Be alert," "Be careful," "Pie in well lit areas," "Don't be sampled."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed within the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were:" "not this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims and people who were considered Muslims, dragged and beat."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love matters."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the US's body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, proselfers and Olympiics."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it might keep a few parking spaces free, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalisation process, one has found that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists are a brain-laundering, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to the world of creation by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux clone with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you look at them, they do not exaggerate what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"every clergyman with whom she spoke, she silenced and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that their anger had made sense, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam re-established the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of anxiety affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: if we fear it will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian governance system, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that when people submit messages that were negatively reported on Muslims, they rather agreed to military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at the mood against Muslims from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collective debt, it is not just about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has my brother become such an accomplished young man?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, has murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had visited in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He was fired eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we talked about it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we wanted to leave to our children: one thing that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we rode silent, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and took off my shoes, and went into the hall, and what I saw was restrained."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and sympathy with panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on the phone number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: well, Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-package setting penetrated into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre-high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting air units, air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-reliance loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences, and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to function autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board determine what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands can be found on the highest level. for example," "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulences like wind bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Date: 06 / 14 / 2009</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce fundamental abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand mobile parts, which meet to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled airplanes, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and cross-section, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside-life happens very much so that it can fly stably and move across the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-star. in order to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the most important skill,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly by flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must become extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">It turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller is falling, the electronics or a battery - can fly the machine further, even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by doing a half of flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will examine synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a palette of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine along the way would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types like us, wages are in development and the creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular fashion."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit up brighter than all stars along in all galaxies throughout the Universe known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"first, let us arrange the events in a timely manner."</seg>
<seg id="476">It was 1.3 billion years ago that there was a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God reigns at -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided to build particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to look for gravitational-waves, which develop through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which greatly improved the detection rate."</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, Ligo was started for a final test run to clarify some minor problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the detectors were commissioned, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, this was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and her by observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a fragment in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stewed into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often perform a properly alberent dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and duve, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched by us at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is to say 20 zeros after comma, followed by 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described hunting after the waves:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are resourceful and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott likes to say, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite handy, because so you can customize a picture or map of things by moving the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in the case of sounds, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now is talking about Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "stupid Bob". ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot do simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can hear the All literally speaking."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"if the two bodies turn very fast, you hear the same pen with an additional key change. this sounds like that: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement pattern shaping into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14th 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo Following: [Surrender noise] Nobody, who knows what to hear, recognises this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling around one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the abiding meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes happen in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own glee."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly, I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen, which we will never see, and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first run that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that bring forth black holes, like Ligo they observe, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the sour nooks, so to speak, for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us a completely different angle of view to the events of the universe, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately to how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circling of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a completely new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Are you dreaming with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I tried an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year I would say to all" "Yes!" "before I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, my fear removed."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," has changed my life. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"guess, I need milk for my cabling."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from there I swear to always play with them, as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a startling side effect: only recently I understood completely, that the" "yes" "legends to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think things out, stir up life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Porn-Movie with PinaPopp</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Porn-Movie with PinaPopp</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV-season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of Television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my series of television runs on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I created myself and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Porn-Movie with PinaPopp</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you are managing a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work, and it is true when I say: I understand that it's not going to dream about a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"everything is a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I go deeper into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, as I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as you can see a high sound, run a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the humming."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I am persuaded to write that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't get me wrong, that's what she does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the humming -- when I began working and working and making, building, creating and working, I discovered this thing, this humming, this energy. the summation!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The summation is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The summation is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you can't strive for greatness."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling that you can't be different than striving for greatness, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the summation.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's going to be genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know I'm not doomed to fail, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a titanium, and I know I don't want to ask it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more I expect."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the summing, the summing, the summing."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the summing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom is a single work institution.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my Mum won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"Emerson says," "Estimate, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby tianas.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the summ ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The summing of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, reworked weekends, no remorse, no remorse, no remorse, a titanium ring does not give up, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a Pre-show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl you, stupid author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do, you're working, you love what you're doing, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the humming if you already knew the humming, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart ceases, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern-state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "Mum, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than to be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" "estimating." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "estimated."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I'm titanium and my marsh mix, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mum, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humming, I can do nothing except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it goes to release, or whatever the girl in" "The Ice Queen". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity are.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me is solving.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that does not happen immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sumptuous, but a humming."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No mystery. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the Titanensummen, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of programmes and TV sessions and how operable my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not a force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums are dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium bin?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice, as far as I want to hear the humming again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not based on how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, for what kind of man prefer to be rather than home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always have access to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">NTF & C.O.N.S. Co-Star Â ®</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why have we ever listened to the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say yes! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you keep me for naive, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, there is no need for more."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can take 15 minutes in the piece, even on a bad day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being oasis, my world."</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children.</seg>
<seg id="759">"to play" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I am leaving and I siege. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes a piece, why not treat yourself in full 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The humming came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy is pouring in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the humming, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The summation of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The summation of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snowing to me that I am a titanium. I have never seen a titanium that is going to go to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum. the land I create, the marathon that I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the summing, the summing, the other, the correct sum: the summation of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, captivating, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this summation, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think of things, I wake you up to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamlike.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and for more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"neurosurgeons are very frustrating for us that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most well-known, the" deep brain stimulation. "in doing so, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered under heavy tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at that time, I was a senior physician, working day and night in the emergency room."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that skull-brain traumas swells the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, you have to reduce the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain-herd-cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">That was what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we met them at the receiving table of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we shave these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we spread the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we found a violation and spread exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimerized.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we cultivate in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feedpellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable level of dexterity, we passed the motor sensors field in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as in the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkeys relaxing spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we spread the cells: the same monkey, two months after the explantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, such as Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implete them with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to conduct this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we don't see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but rather as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imahors in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is waning with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- made clear to me as finance minister in the euro group, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or Communist Party of China, or some of my permissible friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abolish if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, along with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are painted, our future gloomy, and wasted our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of disappearance, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"all of us acknowledge the debt crisis,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin-twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, who, however, are too timid to invest it where it would be productive and to produce income that is urgently needed for humanity, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past three months in the United States, in England and in the euro area, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the 5.1trillion US dollars, which lay around at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except to inflate the stock exchanges and exalt the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low aggregate demand, which, as in an endless loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, which, like in an endless loop, could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing Edipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially finance all of the technologies," green technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth. "</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we understand under democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"the Athenian democracy of course included too many, of course."</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to undermine the significance of Athenian democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it referred to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political participation with equal voting in questions of the state of state."</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenic democracy has not long held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very bright, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens."</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- became a democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, gradually subverted politics and empowered them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it is possible to be in the government today and still not in power, because the power is immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about like a flock of carnivores that have decimated so sustainably the animals from which it nourishes, has decimated that at the end they are starving."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has harmed politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the overall economic demand falls and the corporate directors are too frightened to invest in the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the wasting of human labour-power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and economics, and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economics and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to transform the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and make sure that we democratize the re-united division, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film" "Matrix" "appear like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" Matrix, "in which the society in" Star Trek "is used, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" Agora, "to indulge in long discussions the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it be, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-good utopia instead of the" Matrix "-similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies, please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and income comes from revenue, and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no outstanding twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time liberated, in which she prefers privileged people, and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and keynesianism, global keynesianian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a Matrix - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy... Do we do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transmission of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is thoroughly relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, therefore, I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely verry."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you're not wirr, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you consider from the view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the perception of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what we can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to blame China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells enormous after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greek finance ministers at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I agreed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to the complacency and perpetuating denial that a massive fault line has expired through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European Group, have still chosen denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authoritarianism in life, it may be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he did not make any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the donor's side to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to overthrow our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions passed through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that for 5 years they had been going through a catastrophic program in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the troika's troika imposed on us this policy was: "that was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone is not surviving.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the free centrists will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to smash the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it seems to me, it will also be bearable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for having been with TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he probably is responsible for 22 medium-sized minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is Managing Director at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hair-eater and refers to Twitter as" Films, TV, Technology, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking up the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website, IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is judged with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a season, your brain asks:" where are there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, are shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price is not about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think one needs special intelligence to undermine" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"it makes more thoughts about the medium bulging, average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something so that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and sets them online, where they can watch everyone for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon releases things for nothing, do you use it, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or watch again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican US senators. ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the Manager for Program Design from Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for this super show and he also uses data for it, but it makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a contest, he and his team have looked at the available data on the Netflix viewers, i.e. the reviews they give to the shows whose history they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these small details about the spectators: which shows they like, what producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the pieces together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimized it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, it is a bit scary because we live in a time in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. if you come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone here in the USA is in prison and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always producing the best results. it is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data sealed companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the bad way, they can predict - by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year by year by year until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you basically do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">First you dismantle this problem into your individual parts so you can analyze the items; as a second place the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is to put pieces and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, then a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision about how to take all these parts back together and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they vie for TV ideas, than they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "that's what the data tell us."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data is just one tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thank you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a J- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "most likely" "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it out later with a demo demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more wiser than data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the building structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
