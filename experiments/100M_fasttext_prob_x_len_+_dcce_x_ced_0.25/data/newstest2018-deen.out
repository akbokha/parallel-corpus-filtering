Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
a pit chapel where it is now dig@@ ged for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former bottom of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories about days .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows who had to get upset because the car @-@ navigation system was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
&quot; the large picture postcard was incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called prim@@ eval pet@@ als . &quot;
&quot; these were created according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing management , between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and originate from Bavaria &apos;s first survey@@ ing . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; since the spring 1800 , the French military leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops were finally with@@ drawn with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing management . &quot;
the cover sheet for Munich dates from 18@@ 56 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was born 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 1877 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings &apos; houses are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was renamed in 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian peasantry against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming there appears a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original survey &quot; &quot; from which the property was deduc@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; small par@@ c@@ els today no longer occupy farmers - but small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the October festival , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or &quot; On the Sky &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there , 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich District Ir@@ ving anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; was created . &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , related to the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the prison . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , first place was first , later it was extended to 500 seats . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity no longer suff@@ iced - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , there is the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist . &quot;
&quot; at the site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people in the Munich area of Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with training establishments .
&quot; to the west lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; - in architectural accordance with the original structure of the Ir@@ ving Institution , was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse &quot; &quot; was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies ris@@ ed many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel dating back to the Middle Ages were once stood by Mari@@ enhof , where these days took the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn station . &quot;
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes a warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to promote coloured people has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Mis@@ sour@@ i State , which is to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , promp@@ ts af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention during travel through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities that are di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to extract the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , human beings . &quot;
&quot; they are hal@@ ted because of their skin color , they are struck or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group quoted incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol over the country and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the General Prosecutor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be hal@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of their families , friends and cow@@ or@@ kers about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; Chapel said . &quot;
&quot; people need to be ready to bring interest , or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ le@@ bre@@ chts report of the FBI , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company due to housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , having agreed to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest the local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing according to the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U parliam@@ ent@@ arians Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have created a picture on the spot .
&quot; the owners of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ village together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties met at the grounds of the Hu@@ de@@ mann family @-@ estate , together with mayor Thomas Schneider . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially provided insights into his farm , where he cultivated 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens and accommod@@ ated in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only regional .
&quot; as he is also the chairman of the Bank of Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s bach , he called the electric fence project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t generate profitable on such steep surfaces .
&quot; green land@@ fill provision for a lot of work , much needs to be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser , even if it did not lead to a bio@@ economy . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader subsi@@ dy . &quot;
farmers must be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; the mayor insi@@ sted . &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed for their promotion
&quot; over the electric fence , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the preservation area amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted by half over leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ ladies it &apos;s not possible . &quot;
Peter Weiß was also standing firm : &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ schaft@@ spark Bre@@ eding Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state support of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is the preservation of the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a grant given by the L@@ PR .
&quot; moreover , the area to be f@@ enced must not be tu@@ g@@ able ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the 2018 fisher@@ man &apos;s electric fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence is currently underway . &quot;
&quot; the conservation area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Fir@@ dos Platz in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically limit the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller cons@@ ented not the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of ship@@ owners and Liberty im@@ itation would have g@@ yn@@ ked him if he had done it .
&quot; but he assumed their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... is a symbol of American freedom that en@@ ligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem which you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is really right , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the stir@@ ring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who are longing to breathe freely , / the el@@ usive rub@@ b@@ ish of your wealthy coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; w@@ reck@@ ing apost@@ asy &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller insi@@ sted not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the United States .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a quite different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Laz@@ arus changed the importance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the world around : &quot; Lady liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the importance of the statue is entirely and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ usive but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize .
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not light the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle rec@@ alls a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; the power director of the United Kingdom Athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Cup will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which will start on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; has to be developed and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to figure it out until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ lers - who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captains &quot; speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver med@@ alist , who will compete in the fifth world champ@@ ionships in the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year established five British and two European recor@@ ders .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that you should watch for a great season , which included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first world champ@@ ionships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being part of team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to go on platforms . &quot;
what concerns my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think they went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block@@ ers of Cri@@ tics via Facebook : don &apos;t charm you around a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the natives of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked in the cri@@ tique , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; there are profiles of leading retailers , with analysis of their performance and the challenges they face . &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union was compl@@ aining about it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the cry as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it &apos;s a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a repub@@ lican deputy in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary shar@@ per head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his ha@@ ar@@ less head for chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons coming to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum , is considered official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ aker A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the govern@@ ors &apos; actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I said pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other latest news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea even if a number of people occupy the same subject , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor described as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or er@@ asing a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ tori@@ als and to arrest and silence prot@@ esters . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; President of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County hurt the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so heavy .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable sex had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters sent on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised its position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who passed the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round last year before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he reaches fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is an ard@@ ent advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; said the resident of South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home soil . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can feel this extra pressure too . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
I &apos;m happy about the way it has gone so far .
&quot; the former masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;

fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
&quot; in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passi@@ vity . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 L@@ lung cancer cases were due to passive smoking rates per year , &quot; said Head of Department Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic since 1994 . &quot;

house connections are proving to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in time &quot; , &quot; the head of the Fred Hein@@ ze site . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed because underground much is hidden in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
the traffic that continually hin@@ ders the construction work is a major problem for the building up@@ p of the St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses were eligible for transit .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for several weeks . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
&quot; when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai government in the ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called not@@ a - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red l@@ ol@@ le is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a bad@@ less room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 p.m. , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was included in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal guar@@ dians . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , comprising the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea to the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and made of corrug@@ ated roofs , which were converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones through r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says , pointing to her lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort invested 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion in value . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has kept a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 U.S. dollars in a single officer . &quot;
&quot; after greater autonomy , Pap@@ u@@ an demands thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are mer@@ cil@@ essly treated . &quot;
&quot; according to information from activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tort@@ ured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
&quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ lands in the 1970 &quot; s , according to the Asia @-@ Rights Commission for genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Bec@@ ame Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; is in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week passes through , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have intensi@@ fied since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources get an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants is about 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populations of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping @-@ cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetable with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after the inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 kids was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers killed her tone and returned to four soldiers later , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their gun col@@ t , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavily hit that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice . &quot;
they carried away cerem@@ onial hunting @-@ arches and carried the orph@@ an@@ age - in the circle continuously and im@@ itation - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to hur@@ l stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ e , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said , TIME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
Kay@@ e still does not know who fired it but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I knew him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; back up &quot; &quot; their station only because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , commission@@ er Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ sist@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came first the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he establishes an extra @-@ judicial mechanism for resol@@ ving historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ th years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be gone , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto graduated as he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , saying he had no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; accused of comm@@ itting more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody In@@ dependence Day in 1999 , Wir@@ anto said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes says . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the found@@ ries have not ceased .
&quot; on Tuesday , Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man into the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus Douglas , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , who responded by firing al@@ erts . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house .
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to account for the officers involved and to withdraw the police brig@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the members of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green Hochland of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by increasing spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the Top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : above all Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can always edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ ection@@ ate migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deport@@ ed because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although rare permission was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign , the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s un@@ even east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai fo@@ undry . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , president of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; fault &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money ; they want only justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims resulted in a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ ses of a victim were buried on a site exactly against the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ oto with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residen@@ ces in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about ten minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said the fire fighting units against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from disgu@@ ise , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup @-@ reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup match at the General Meeting .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport , to play Davis Cup single only on two profits , was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain preserved to the traditional rate . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.6 % of member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the candidate .
&quot; after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies even before the vote , the proposal had already come to court the final at a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the first round in the next round .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs of the organizers , the requirements in terms of training kits etc. will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to undergo fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers will bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among flying passengers revealed that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items passed on the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally bore forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they were er@@ ron@@ eous with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;

the company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gled goods had brought to the airport security and how many did it inten@@ tionally .

&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;

El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electric jack El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever @-@ tri@@ alled figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k for the first time revealed another , less brilliant figure in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery just commen@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k acknow@@ le@@ dges : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3,000 have been with@@ drawn again . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation In@@ duction . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations pre@@ tend , in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500,000 , by 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are about 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; if you order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines without major inter@@ rup@@ tions at maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there is too much delay , then the non @-@ binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in crowds . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt is with@@ drawing from the reluc@@ tance of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities over previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran for states on October 1 , in order to comply with the 2015 O@@ zone standards . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt has announced that he will delay the compliance with one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing in local decisions or to interfere with economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been forced to block or delay regulations that reflect the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the entry regul@@ atory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington has decided that the EPA administrators have exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA often did not obey the dead@@ lines for implementation and then been waiting to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement reached the appointment for the implementation , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available power &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General Prosecutor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA in this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the reverse of the EPA - following our law@@ suits - is an important benefit to the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists acclaimed a change of course in their course .
&quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe in , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;

tum@@ ours celebrate 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery @-@ site in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the saving and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ gens to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel was first documented in the &quot; &quot; Würt@@ t@@ ember@@ g@@ ischer Ur@@ gent Design &quot; &quot; : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ ab@@ bey at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the words of the deed , on Tum@@ linger Berg , apart from the former parish church , there was also a glorious court , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ al right belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the town @-@ image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; is the third , the most blessed sett@@ ler nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 strengthen these historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ al law originated from the early medieval peculi@@ arities of its own .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished and occupied with a pastor continued to remain the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
this was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger of the two sh@@ attered on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly acquired bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the windows were in@@ laid and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops camp@@ ed near the church . &quot;
&quot; they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ary Church ab@@ orted .
only the steep@@ le was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night of 18@@ 34 , a storm split the steep@@ le and half sank . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
only the still existing tower of tower survived as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius facility as successor to Dieter Dock@@ horn .
&quot; as organisers , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin invite to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel . &quot;
this is designed by the Combo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the for@@ e@@ word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is at 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; at the end of the seren@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , the organizers take out the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and listeners . &quot;
friends and Förder@@ er Tum@@ bl@@ gens feel particularly committed to home care such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to permit approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim does &quot; &quot; sees itself &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim w@@ ills itself &quot; has promp@@ ted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border of Schwal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone exists . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are meant to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had determined a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days before , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a form mistake . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning law , the approval of approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be taken back , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the District Government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been received in Vier@@ sen Circle since last week , &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings of the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in the content of the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , is planning to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of approximately 11,@@ 400 households will be covered - this corresponds to about one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW CD will invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park at Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor crash together : woman dies with a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in a deadly way .
two more people were injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police statements , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her car as a companion , drove the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother . &quot;
city and De@@ aler Planning &quot; Hom@@ eland @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ aer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre . &quot;
&quot; the commercial and city authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 , in order to l@@ ure people to the city &apos;s shopping spre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; as the Chairman of the Trade Committee , Christian König , announced that the &quot; Home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will raise customers awareness of what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will be invited to &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , city administration and trade @-@ bever@@ ag cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry . &quot;
&quot; thus , the trade @-@ bever@@ ag and the city are entering a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offerings , such as the first &quot; Active Day , &quot; as well as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; at the well @-@ held Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to make them active . &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials are to be re @-@ opened again or again . &quot;
among these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories all over the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was , with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that partly spread , the king said in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should be &quot; &quot; promoting the appreciation of local trade and to emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
&quot; the action , conducted by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners , makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct environment . &quot;
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine more were injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire brig@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical state on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
one person died as part of a school building in the explosion collap@@ sed .
a first missed was recovered later also dead .
the dead were the employees of the school .
&quot; as a mis@@ fortune , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; during the holiday season , there were only a few people in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy . &quot;
b@@ ump after sent tran@@ scripts of telephone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27th , a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to called on to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president compl@@ ained that he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scri@@ bed of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an ex@@ cl@@ ined exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia is ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was sent by the government Obama would look like a &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump termin@@ ated the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : milit@@ ants launch rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as appeal for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ year Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and sailed to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a needle @-@ grab suit - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ screen .
inside the in@@ mates dri@@ fted in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
&quot; luckily , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , citizens of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were dra@@ fted by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , assi@@ sting in organizing the post@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former minister of the state of Georgia and a life long civil rights lawyer .
&quot; for him , the post@@ age serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual commem@@ oration of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to obtain justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court physician places a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI acts received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding neighbor@@ hoods were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but none has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain open for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made possible the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in the summer election campaign . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the election , according to the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com &apos;s black color monitor , Roger Mal@@ com , stab@@ bed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a ly@@ n@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosec@@ utions , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and covering the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more distinctive .
&quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her presentation is descri@@ p@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - pushed into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed survey of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines . &quot;
&quot; the play starts with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester calls out and har@@ ms him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he van@@ ished from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona re@@ jects the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona said . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people &apos; n --- he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ cona said the N @-@ Word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays enter@@ prising pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators swe@@ pt sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided evenly between black and white .
&quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ an oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks transl@@ ates her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have been an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ kill@@ ers took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
&quot; children squ@@ at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene wishes to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ una embr@@ aces two of his te@@ amm@@ ates and then breaks in their arms we@@ eping and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks down with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done that for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat down with the actors for dinner . &quot;
at a table a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ atted about the post with a black couple that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words about the feeling of the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today this is called only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ ma@@ ged@@ don &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a multi @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) is an option to display a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; pl@@ ush and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine mur@@ ders pose as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - Money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; K@@ ess se@@ duc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , drag@@ ging a body into the trunk in Hollywood Man@@ age and give the ri@@ wall@@ ets cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ ously fi@@ esen Hagen that surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) must also believe in it . &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with a powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated in a stor@@ my way , who humble himself and bow@@ ed their hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is great appl@@ ause for the Fest@@ spiel@@ orchester , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat in casual leisure wear . &quot;
Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors had been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a hilly pipe concert over himself , five years later , there was great jubil@@ ation in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max amounts working as a volunteer
they work equally at several locations in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; a lot : usually in Stein@@ furt at the stock exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I already worked in the open all @-@ day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; a lot : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
= = = &gt; Fu@@ ji@@ war@@ a = = = &gt; Fu@@ ji@@ war@@ a
&quot; and then a building engineer studies , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off . &quot;
I recognized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different with people .
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing . &quot;
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the burning point , maybe , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably do a social worker training at the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you power the FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
it was very varied with me .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in after@@ no@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
it &apos;s different from a civil engineering degree ?
&quot; of course , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family - one must always deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for that I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is just like that . &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts more 3.000 jobs and cuts the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will disman@@ tle another 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced . &quot;
&quot; job reductions , which General Director John Fall@@ on , mainly announced at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 points have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at Ber@@ tel@@ smann &apos;s partner in the past month , said that the outlook for the business year was unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital of Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured and declared a declaration of NATO .
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violent act that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by Nato , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive rate . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable condition and treated in the US military hospital at the Bag@@ ram airport .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , at least 1.6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ b@@ om killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed over 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops su@@ pers@@ eded the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump weigh@@ ed down the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and in particular the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g @-@ rule after complaints
&quot; the U.S. environmental authority has a decision to delay Obama &apos;s government regulation , repe@@ aled that the states are committed to em@@ power@@ ing smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 states compl@@ ained the agency because of the cr@@ ot@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in late on Wednesday , the EPA announced the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Conditions 2015 &quot; and said that they show the obligation of the agency to work with countries . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt has announced the intention of EPA , the o@@ zone determination - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in part of the country , where cuts must be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the Colombia District , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump will boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and nature conservation groups , who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants to share common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ o @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln resol@@ ves the establishment of a joint space in the future retirement community . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing piece of land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although the church community is still part of the municipal property until the church community has so far been part of the church , there is now no planning event for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council are floating in front of such a common room , not as a meeting place , only for the residents of the living @-@ fair living , but openly entering into the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget , will be decided by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution sees to signal the investor that in this respect , one does not want to throw a b@@ ill@@ board between the legs , the finding before that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - which reduces the height of the beam and makes the construction more economical - is possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the committee .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which one is not progres@@ sing so much , that you can rest now in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; I &apos;m hard doing it . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger den@@ ies itself absolutely for the common room - but absolutely opposed to municipal participation .
&quot; behind this , it sees a hidden subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface one does not give a subsi@@ dy , but gets a real , in case of doubt ver@@ tig@@ inous counter@@ f@@ eit , is the counter@@ point . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s motion to split the proposal accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; in this way it remains in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we make the decision , we make a giant leap forward to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on road
&quot; crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police said , the 82 @-@ year Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road by 12 : 20 with his bike on the cycle path of the Schwar@@ zer route from Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road to the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was running on the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered heavy injuries and was taken to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must ref@@ rain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund to David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personal care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season . &quot;
seven pro@@ s lack the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the winner of the cup .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30@@ pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the number of personnel at the German football @-@ record champion Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger . &quot;
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also abst@@ ain from David Al@@ aba in the Du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
&quot; the Munich @-@ based Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six weeks , An@@ cel@@ otti made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; this was not good , last but not least . &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to be intelligent , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights is captiv@@ ating the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
in the resin from star to star hike
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ route &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is the case of the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary way is available in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ Trail &quot; &quot; comes to meet the needs of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , it was called . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to establish boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the association will plan &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations in five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the panels is to be complemented by the Internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ route Zug &quot; &quot; should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the ast@@ er@@ isk path , the viewer experiences a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star was stronger than another , although it was far more distant . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
the association has been running the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; in the university city , there has been something similar to the planned Star @-@ wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Dis@@ aster since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet takes its stel@@ ae up to the Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ planets degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly by distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away the sun measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the total distance of the planet road is nearly four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from Sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to get to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; as a result , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
the march to the next fix@@ ation would take half a year .
&quot; Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ disputed World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , down the hall to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super Sus@@ pension Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defended his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 PM on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former feather weight , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I rose up for the bronze , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down on lightweight .
and he must move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 pound dé@@ but this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight for the network that offers the best finance package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ ons Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held up with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks that the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which was built up for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the struggle that needs to be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; said Mr Lom@@ ach@@ enko : &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded after tire bur@@ ners
&quot; when an accident on the A7 took place on Thursday afternoon , four people were severely injured . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost shortly before the connection point Market @-@ wide , probably after a tire maker , to control his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then stood on the roof of the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service the A7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident stop . &quot;
&quot; Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , as they were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to look even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ cycle should also be further optimized . &quot;
and a gate after a spin do not want to capture the lag@@ o@@ ons any more .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain hoist . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know yet how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; Because we are in the three @-@ chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , but that we are better harmon@@ izing and we do not make so many errors in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite ok , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; Fried@@ helm said , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken pre@@ matur@@ ely due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland serve as an easy favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas leadership coach . &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so spark@@ le does not want to experience its players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ holder evaluation tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; they are to make a more precise assessment of age during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish immigration authority ( migration ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were at the age of age . &quot;
&quot; to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent around 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been evaluated more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det conducted the results published in 5@@ 81 , she stated that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of the medical age assessment , in the x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I photographs of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus from the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans , to see if they were going to go through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being un@@ correctly assessed as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a concrete part of the bridge was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of the Department of Road Safety and Transport in the government Pres@@ i@@ dium of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began at the same time on all three buildings in need between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the project is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a protective arch bridge from concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning on the North side , has a 1.@@ 30 m wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a border attachment , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will be running .
&quot; the special thing is that it is manufacturing parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge valves .
particular flair @-@ tip @-@ feeling has necess@@ itated the laying of lines through the construction plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project prior to their work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be wi@@ ped off . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the scrap@@ ers in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated without a trace by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for building work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; are fully closed . &quot;
the costs for the three bridge compensation amounts to EUR 700 000 .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful protest under German potato salad
&quot; but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the day of the volcanic Eifel region ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) are part of a broad coalition that shows this day peaceful flags , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ro@@ del invites the poster &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land will be the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ artists , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself there .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; &quot; original potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police has ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , which shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of Af@@ D volcano &apos;s Eifel reports that he stri@@ ved for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had been in demand in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces available due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; so the Ro@@ un@@ del , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says , &quot; This is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does it : at about 8@@ pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 people in the hall waiting for the top candidates for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; for more than one hour the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but there is also a short time after 21 : 00 . &quot;
the police can turn off - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is present in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20.00 o &apos;clock in the church of the monastery . &quot;
&quot; with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
this is Pet@@ kov sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to transc@@ end boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach is thus sounding like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz guitarist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mixes classical , jazz and free play to an intri@@ gu@@ ing total artwork . &quot;
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program has only been premier@@ ed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most famous relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague , Robert Patt@@ inson , who eventually ended up bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I liked . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten announced that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
it has never been pu@@ zz@@ led or hin@@ dered .
&quot; I only liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; in particular , she suffered , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was 11 , the kids told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , fri@@ ghtened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &quot; &quot; Girl , be proud of you ! &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in particular , they do not like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to find yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the Rally broke out in che@@ ers .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes reports that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee announced on Thursday evening an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working out to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the f@@ ew@@ est legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC leader R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the worldwide leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as an apparent ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport . &quot;
Russian Athle@@ tics Director Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were str@@ apped away with gold and silver medals at competitors . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that it is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete for the World Athle@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the director of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needed to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
p@@ its for soldiers crashed into Mali
&quot; during a funeral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two fallen in Mali were thought to have fallen down in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; as a matter of fact , Minister of Defence Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she described the two inver@@ ted pilots , but as &quot; &quot; cor@@ on@@ ators of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice that they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen arrived in Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the relatives in the Church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr , Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Trau@@ gr@@ ä@@ ste laid hands on ro@@ ses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of the Ley@@ en distinguished the fallen soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sat@@ anic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann developed the flight operation of the combat helicopter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger @-@ pilots of its reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; a doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not show : the deployment is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave near his wife
&quot; after his death , the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife . &quot;
that shared the royal house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agrees with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the hei@@ r climb of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also took the title &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ahl . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief of the Danish royal family , said . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; born in London in 1965 , the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristocr@@ acy . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost fifty @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk @-@ sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of society critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seem to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed of me .
that was just two fl@@ aws ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he spoke for the Parliament &apos;s dis@@ solution . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties from their country Sunday group in Lower Saxony led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its cap one @-@ voice @-@ majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; said Mr Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler , S &amp; D Group CEO Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler , wants his group to take it up . &quot;
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the relationship was revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag will be scheduled for January 14th next year .
&quot; according to Th@@ üm@@ ler , the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether or not they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Diet decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; the state constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility of the Parliament &apos;s Parliament to depri@@ ve the Prime Minister , and elect a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace , if they are legally sensible . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but somewhat curious . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself a b@@ ail of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the stub@@ born dep@@ u@@ ties to return their land mandate .
&quot; we naturally expect them to return their land mandate , which they have received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; shared the pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen extra@@ ordinarily . &quot;
she deliberately chose not to lead a pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even against the background , there was no content differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the aband@@ on@@ ment of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the attitude of the former Green Party Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal to the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in her latest vanity and her fru@@ stration , the politi@@ cian en@@ ligh@@ tens her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony will participate in this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to take political capital from it .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U fac@@ tion@@ manager Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
&quot; chief of the SPD in the SPD , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , rejected T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 election calendar with personal career @-@ giving . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest power , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens in the parliament had a very thin majority of one vote . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer . &quot;
Mr. Schmidt : how can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ing eggs ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Federal States provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlighten@@ er is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dism@@ ay . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the trade , as well as the manufacturers , has to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless health@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; if the resi@@ due is exceeded by 0.@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg in case of eggs , they are not capable of transport . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the factories are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , the production companies do not find any direct fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must account for the alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damage . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too little controllers in the seri@@ ousness . &quot;
is it missing only on the personnel or on the coher@@ ent jurisdiction ?
it was precisely the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; for that reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can be available are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made several distin@@ ctions that I expect a complete recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; if an insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ de@@ mic means are manufacturers , retailers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it has to be consistent with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and without gaps .
how the Foot@@ ball financial rules impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ interrupted issues from the European soccer clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that over@@ sees the European game has the power to for@@ bid cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes down and brings him to a galax@@ y of other stars , in the face of the financing of the team by the King@@ doms family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate income sources that allow them to reach the break @-@ even point in their activities on football . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then heavily invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - become a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P event period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency in the United States in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor , Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it may distribute the amount for the invoice on the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum up of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements can be exp@@ ended for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a cash penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could attempt to ou@@ tw@@ it their financial supervision by imposing their income through companies connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup will be amb@@ ass@@ adors , and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators is easy to figure out . &quot;
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke on the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways , or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline dict@@ ates the order .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality check .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
some 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate bars packaged for 14 grams per year distribute the flight attend@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious job for a chocolate manufacturer .
&quot; as many applicants have received in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to reveal . &quot;
&quot; however , only Swiss manufacturers are in question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment . &quot;
Swiss chocolate panels have been distributed on board their flights since 2006 .
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut in collaboration with Hu@@ g delivered chocolate tablets before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time nostal@@ g@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ th years , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge period ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ ehler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is tight .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a nice can of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by focusing on the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors play dirty children , who grow up - still create the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adult , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more according to the casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker Films of the 90 @-@ th years such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that shi@@ vers the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; a character is rum@@ ored by an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the am@@ i@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot that is included in the Ronald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ known impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt Dill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of random mad@@ ness that could hei@@ ghten this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his East @-@ West Ring@@ campaign icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director , indicates a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic idi@@ ot - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English . &quot;
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; the list of famous speakers - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &quot; Find out the voice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desp@@ airing propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a re@@ agent mask is involved - it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; rade Det@@ ective , who was edited to a lower length could deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re better , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continually visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can make everything for@@ age for a success .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs @-@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; Wednesday morning the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart saw numerous objects , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Constance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the process , 15 defend@@ ants at the age of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warran@@ ts had already been issued against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officers put greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested . &quot;
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , poll@@ uted murder , as well as rou@@ gh@@ ness and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning , the great use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , mainly Italian nation@@ als returned with en@@ close relation to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ ging , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
fashion mo@@ ans large gaps in the foreig@@ ner tab
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear : &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , draws attention to large gaps in the foreign regi@@ stran@@ t register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned manner in an analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; has been present . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the Register , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently cared for , the quality of data in parts has not been good . &quot;
&quot; in isolated cases data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data input can slow down processes much slower , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the statistics of char@@ geable people , EU citizens are also registered , who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; however , such false assignments led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with exp@@ atri@@ ates , &quot; it is said in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children once they came from there . &quot;
&quot; it emerges from an internal paper issued by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is said that the BA@@ MF leads such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees arriving at the EU . &quot;
&quot; if a migrants are travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of annex@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the office now follows : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the reception capacity for families with children under age in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) keeps these commitments enough .
other EU states would also return refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal polic@@ eman of the Left Socialist Party in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening conditions of reception and a threat to child welfare because of the lack in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second @-@ best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach , the blood donation service was already available to other people . &quot;
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Jur@@ gen Gre@@ ul , who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 funds in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the municipality appreci@@ ates multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood at the meeting of the Municipal Council . &quot;
&quot; it is ingen@@ ious how our bodies are laid out for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors that their blood is available to strangers , even more un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the area manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , ma@@ ize trees were reported by the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer were among the multi @-@ fac@@ ul@@ ties and were awarded for 50 contributions of blood . &quot;
&quot; half as many re@@ book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the Monetary Committee &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members to increase in this month because weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in their quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and from 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would likely rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation rate infected by the Bre@@ x@@ it , and it said that the credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mam@@ mot@@ h business package which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the next February , although it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain ti@@ ghtening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; scale than the markets expected . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank emphasized that &quot; &quot; incre@@ mental &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would take place . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound came after these news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened rising expectations for a zinc increase , and GDP rose to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as shar@@ pen@@ ing will be worse first before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years could not &quot; prevent &quot; in@@ comes , but she added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year forecast will be &quot; clear . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which compens@@ ates for a portion of lower consumption expendi@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote , which caused the lowering of the pounds . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on the rate of interest rates , the call for a zinc increase increased because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation declined from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be attracting them again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the exceed@@ ance of its target of 2 % was &quot; entirely &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ argue , director of Cor@@ eco mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are lou@@ dly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages finish , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight in front of the High Court for the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service through a first three @-@ year study of approximately 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice , confir@@ ming that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the alleg@@ ation that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduced the HIV transmission in cases of infection .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics are identified suitable candidates who consent to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the overall potential of pre@@ p by examining clinical evidence , as used in a large scale , and implemented . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when it is targeted at vulnerable and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; said Mr Green , President of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; said Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living Your Big Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , took place in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add a Jo@@ anne storage room and mezzanine to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , in order to rede@@ em the announcement . &quot;
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture ; silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all cut@@ lery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; Er@@ fan explains from the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you slide the door , it slides very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t fall into the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square metre number of slightly default in something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument about one of the biggest real estate @-@ imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis res@@ ides in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their properties are to be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with their mother Anna , the Brothers owns 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now covers offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - Paul described as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of corporate assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
this means that Col@@ in property has a value of $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of issue for Paul .
&quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of what Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul ahead to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ k of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , but Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of her financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in kept himself very shy , even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media dealt with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case was before courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul chose to su@@ e me and draw up our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; new Chief of Staff &quot; &quot; plans to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports on news media - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , on his first day of work with executive employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he wanted to fix : poor information thrown into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to be convinced , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep the t@@ iness of Twitter habit controlled , according to six former elections officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
date : 06 / 14 / 2009
&quot; but the idea that &quot; &quot; Twitter custom &quot; &quot; was ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something else we don &apos;t know - that afflic@@ ted twe@@ ets without their interventions would have included more ignition .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his staff made it a few times to keep anno@@ y@@ ance from him , their efforts paid off . &quot;
but nobody has consistently been able to prevent trou@@ gh controversi@@ es .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , repeatedly attempt to advance their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material that may potentially promote their views from the world . &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to provide dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former dump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of the chic@@ ane , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced wrong accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it . &quot;
ump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the dump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be wor@@ sen@@ ed and hoped . &quot;
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday Euro@@ pol reported about the action following the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent cal@@ ender from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ ets hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ want , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online requests could be arrested until now , at least 11 of them due to the information posted on the website . &quot;
travellers talk about a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on the feet of war , which have negotiated a tr@@ ench from the community in order to demand a field in front of their man@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Milli@@ on@@ aire Series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were kick@@ ed out in May without having been deter@@ red by a tr@@ ench excav@@ ated by the Council , in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence plant and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; Ramp@@ ager &apos;s residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous citizen said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by Sch@@ am , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it .
&quot; a resident who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of those travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you have seen even a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for Soli@@ hull explains : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine , when we present our case . &quot;
Birk@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made up of the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
the house is heated by electricity . 2 bathrooms with shower . 2 toilets .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and recei@@ pts from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but especially Freuden@@ stadt sailors Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with its managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ städ@@ ter building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof , construction sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time and when one enters the house it becomes clear , which extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were pulled out , blan@@ kets , partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the black walnut style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything should later be &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , spa and conference room are part of the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one doesn &apos;t want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer points out . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread widely , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; both single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with OB @-@ Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Officer Michael Kr@@ ause , as Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; less than a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the exterior installations are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is public , will be accessible . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russian affair around U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the committee has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; referring to the matter familiar people . &quot;
the newspaper reported the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
the station CN@@ N reported that there are already initial inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ an in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there was agreement between Tr@@ umps Elec@@ tive campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , there are several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special En@@ counter sni@@ pped personally into the center and investigate whether the President might hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges are to be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called &quot; &quot; Prosec@@ ution &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they are mostly switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for hearing under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , people who were involved in the meeting were asked to say it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; next to Tr@@ ump J@@ r there were also tr@@ umps coun@@ sel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his former campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in the interview . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the exposure show that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the case of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme will give the democr@@ ats a chance to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; this work is also usually in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House recommends any measures that accelerated the work of the Special intermedi@@ ary in a &quot; fair manner . &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something has changed , in the Declaration . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been loud , he would h@@ amp@@ er the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee in June , report@@ edly asked him for an attitude of investigation against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
the pur@@ est spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
&quot; unlike an independent medi@@ ator of Congress such as Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theore@@ tically could be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties , however , want to prevent such a step . &quot;
two groups of repub@@ lican and democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday after which the special agent could no longer be dism@@ issed so easily .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the West Ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg has released itself from the seven @-@ fold size of Berlin by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
this was shared by the Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , which is heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now runs north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for human beings .
to what extent the climate change played a role in the ab@@ rup@@ tion of the ice age is unclear according to research data .
&quot; in total , however , for about 30 years , there has been a series of unusual erup@@ tions of ice cream in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
&quot; until now , the broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it always grows further into the sea and stops regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
&quot; North of this shelf life , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was dis@@ rupted several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen can be found there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece is broken down at a key point . &quot;
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level because they float on the water and displ@@ ace ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small extent , the British research project writes to the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ sen is the fourth @-@ largest shelf of Ant@@ arc@@ tica according to A@@ WI data of almost 50 000 square kilometres .
&quot; at the junction from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware of us , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists argue , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ter will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers did not lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , there have been a lot of ice @-@ cho@@ col@@ ates in the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula in recent decades . &quot;
this long stretch of Ant@@ arc@@ tica covers South America .
&quot; according to data from the research programme British Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
to decrease was the increase in temperature .
&quot; the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the last 50 years , making the temperature most steep . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to have Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls to leave the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new authorities have entered the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have their first day of work behind them . &quot;
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very much sought @-@ after .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; however , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration are looked for . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now begin the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the parties &apos; wish , management should develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act future @-@ oriented applicants &apos; scar@@ city . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented both internally and extern@@ ally , to show concrete measures for trans@@ verse no@@ vices and include an education offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition by the public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees who have a disease @-@ related or age @-@ related task come out of the service . &quot;
&quot; it is time for action , so that no more places will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
he long ago caused a great surprise when he questioned the pay@@ roll and bl@@ am@@ bled the rest of the parties .
peoples want all possibilities to be checked for leaving a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration should strive with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available when you switch to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees care for the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution laws . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy har@@ dens its tone with NGOs &apos; migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warn that they must not continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their crew had effectively worked with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself in detailed alleg@@ ations by the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge all alleg@@ ations , which are currently being collected , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew assumes infl@@ atable migrants who are delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of over@@ seeing the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , which monitors the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct boats , like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , must first have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; substantial changes or han@@ di@@ caps &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti , meanwhile , said that the number of migrants , who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations , declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal guards and co @-@ operation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate , for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , three guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim on hot summer temperatures .
&quot; the following View@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
the second day went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; once again , a viewpoint at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wery &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and handmade hu@@ ts brought some welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed into br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
also Neustadt has been controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 altitude metres , the group had become acquainted with the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium in wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and giant tour@@ neys with high levels . &quot;
&quot; this has also been recognised by the first federal states , who are increasingly involved in this area . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that there are several clubs rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the FIFA World Cup will be organising the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London this weekend , where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 year @-@ olds , that the young people will also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , you could be present online much more often on these markets than once a year send the federal lig@@ aments to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; at E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA are challenged on competition level . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , as in the normal sport , it is established , in which the pro@@ s compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sports is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a kind of sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to . &quot;
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ bing dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also needs cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ ang also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games and in the scene the structures of classical sports l@@ acked .
&quot; in a positive way , the scientist empha@@ sizes the highly integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are travelling internationally , it &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study of Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) prec@@ edes rapid growth to the e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales of 130 million are expected . &quot;
that is not enough for the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already further .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participated in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says F@@ rob@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football first league associations according to Dut@@ t are now obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Management R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to fall into nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
you can &apos;t cling to that only in football everything remains as it always was .

Michelle Carter den@@ ounced because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy would like to commit suicide
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years , because she has encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
Carter was sentenced to life in June for a casual killing by Conrad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ separ@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argue that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward @-@ looking eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have revers@@ ed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they de@@ pl@@ ore completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness has a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ utor also read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters to be there , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; Gary &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; not having the only person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain I will keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a coal oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; All you need to do is turn the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was seeking attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was convic@@ ted for murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ Me : learning from the new mini @-@ l@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ my was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern def@@ ends a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - Extra motivation does not damage .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ my instantly saw , even though the extra piece of clothing was very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made the Bin@@ de just split up to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the one could have better run than at 0 : 2 versus the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach could also suggest Kim@@ Me .
&quot; not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f pro@@ s , but he was chosen from the holidays . &quot;
&quot; sugar is distributed to those , to whom you want to pay a lot that you want to keep in the mood . &quot;
&quot; so , who was chosen to take possession of the heritage of L@@ ahm , can only use a small extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take on responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ashed as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field . &quot;
&quot; to the right rear , this is his position , the white binding on the arm did its rest . &quot;
Kim@@ i also worked in this initial formation like the one who can take the helm best into his hand .
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un @-@ coordinated group . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal wanted to re@@ play his missing fitness , Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on the Devil come to the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le were not neg@@ atively affected by their first appearance in Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked out quite well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran down beside Kim@@ Me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was very difficult , moreover , Sü@@ le also tried successfully in the game building a couple of times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy adm@@ its that the result was &quot; &quot; not the way we were hoping for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at his debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; I was also brought up for this style . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for instance did not give one or two interviews in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me said good@@ bye to a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more . &quot;

companies satisfied with the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate cabinet : economy pra@@ ises bis@@ sing Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is evident after more than a year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V questions of change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ dle the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al is in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes to set up a planning process until 2021 . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ eration of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal highway plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister of minist@@ erial advis@@ er Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; of course , it looks like a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) is asp@@ iring to be inspired by Wis@@ sing , in the wine of an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of exports of German exports over the past ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce commen@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of C@@ rafts in Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1,000 euros is fores@@ een for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates in ten years after the master training are self @-@ employed . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned road building complex facts are to be created , at the same time l@@ acked the country at the nec@@ essi@@ ties of staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to hire the Wis@@ sing in state @-@ run mobility , only 29 places have been occupied . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; in addition , CD@@ U fac@@ tion@@ President Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million Euros in 2017 and 2018 less in the maintenance of national high@@ ways . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind @-@ force company Pro Wind . &quot;

Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said that the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving limitations , &quot; and related there@@ with to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - prohi@@ bits or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; to install the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases em@@ bos@@ sed by diesel vehicles , also take on what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of sh@@ ed@@ ding the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the study could weigh Volkswagen heavy : the luxury car manufacturer contributes propor@@ tionally to the benefit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los l@@ umps and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on@@ ists , the rab@@ ies of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
even with 85 the Argent@@ inians still record and work on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he included among other things as dra@@ fts@@ men for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded at the end of the 60s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o characters cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting on the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches continue to find its funny figures worldwide . &quot;
for six years he has worked on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - , who has a jack @-@ jack as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which should come to the screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he rather focuses on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is word@@ less produced . &quot;
lav@@ ender is threatened by climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to the conditions of dro@@ ught and insect @-@ borne insects , the lav@@ ender is rel@@ eg@@ ating what scientists and farmers are trying to find solutions , causing major head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence has been effectively endangered because in the past years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small ik@@ ade , a micro@@ Bac@@ ter@@ ia , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden transm@@ its , and with very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers but also for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are taken into consideration include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sia meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they have been told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what is more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the Rep@@ orter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the pay@@ roll of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest in the violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss about their shared themes that trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Special Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ sia , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ separ@@ able and even though the terrain is still more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sia in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing but silence on Val@@ dez .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of dist@@ orted , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug merchandise routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , broke down with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed Gang@@ members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to not comp@@ el Val@@ dez , after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US @-@ Dollar investments . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the poison gas problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task you assign to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead men ... why didn &apos;t you tell what went before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ sia team missed Val@@ dez , the river @-@ bird , who was able to cur@@ b like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar across the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now ask them , &apos; Is his love to the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their job best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret wings and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust your own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells incorrect , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , the editor of Ri@@ odo@@ sia Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with J@@ avier is happening . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ sia met for safety training suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that spy@@ ware , which is sold solely to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen tried protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters survey@@ ed whether these officers are among the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who owned the governor themselves as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters went into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ sia has looked on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of brother Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending concentrated on the home town of the governor .
&quot; and there was a group located in one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , belonging to the reig@@ ning Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the entire century all political levels . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of his slender body keyboard . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the Val@@ dez office became a storage room for signs and stick@@ ers , which protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
Rep@@ orter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few notes and went to a demonstration in the morning for another journalist for the office of the public prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mic@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned physi@@ que was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der , having written down in organized protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and constructions . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and attempts to gather international support for justice in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez den@@ ounced the authorities to spy on journalists and to kill them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has asked since then that she is re@@ classified by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , the government officials involved and an equally valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; in Mexico , you die , because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found together with a note , supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as it did El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly aimed at the cart@@ els with a editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is difficult to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for haz@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City for three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with high @-@ risk decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , adm@@ its that drug trafficking de@@ fies it . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on Friday when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ sia sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer once all their phones began to bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
a series of gun@@ fights with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a series of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the Bord@@ stein@@ kan@@ te they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ sia via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enen He@@ ul@@ ten nearby - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the paper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ sia followed his foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think of closing , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when on the same day , when J@@ avier was murdered , the tra@@ inees asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of an &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ r living in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has amazed researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that was out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth @-@ dump@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only ble@@ w a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and is similar to a walking tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed us to mix well into its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preserved specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution was fav@@ oring the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong boot@@ y behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal in indications of his life , including his preserved intest@@ ines , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much far@@ ther widely distributed than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dose @-@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin , but also remains in three dimensions and preser@@ ves the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just take a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the cycle time was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rus , which stood on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 inches long sp@@ ik@@ es that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater coverage of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the door@@ steps still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is so &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
in thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , miles long st@@ aus and g@@ aff . &quot;
&quot; on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; according to the first data of the police , there were nearly 30 vehicles between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , among them probably trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , there is no information about the exact number of injured . &quot;
&quot; it is an easy to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the Munich direction , there was a set@@ back of approximately ten kilometres . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff . &quot;
&quot; the fire brig@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle hand@@ le@@ men , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ishments . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident happened on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a helicopter was on the way to the accident stop .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing remin@@ ding you in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an ingen@@ ious thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
the conductor comes and awak@@ ens an uns@@ hi@@ ft or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
membership @-@ no . K @-@ 07@@ 72 @-@ 86@@ 73
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the reck@@ less card control .
you simply confirm by using your mobile phone that you take your seat and thus de@@ valu@@ e@@ the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available in many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; refers to the fair@@ lead de@@ valuation without she@@ ep@@ sake .
&quot; in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and one has to have booked an online ticket - which already do most passengers .
&quot; it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls out his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation will then appear with the test customers .
the train attend@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; when the driver comes to place Y at the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with an already de@@ valued online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so one can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn makes use of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel without ticket control by our train crew , checked in the DB Navigator just themselves . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often runs train , knows that besides delays and missed trains , the ticket controls are among the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for many times you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not all the documents that you need to de@@ preci@@ ate online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or the identity card , or any other document you have to show . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between the train attend@@ ant and the passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in the control of your own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this applies only to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
wh@@ os@@ oever advoc@@ ates the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ os@@ e@@ ther Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that she rented and sc@@ roll@@ ments by Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; confused , since no one else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to twe@@ et live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she set off her mobile phone to return to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people who cried out , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman captured his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all sl@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell to her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the sight of people who live in commun@@ ion and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a rell with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
&quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any disgu@@ sting racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the impossible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an arrived , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to &quot; document , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to mind , &quot; Will you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism rum for death @-@ det@@ ain@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell , along with six other natives , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant of the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ es &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the gener@@ alization of black people .
Ferr@@ is &apos;s story also repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Matter movement .
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Matter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although it was at the front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the security cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a voice and she feels bound to this memory since she went into the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the theme is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the remaining shops also profit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction work , it will conclude . &quot;
Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and ad@@ mitt@@ edly to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Simone &apos;s guest@@ rooms : &quot; we have been buying a farmer &apos;s market almost every week for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country@@ women always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ ch@@ ery we discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after building the gallery a chance exists to maintain this offer .
in other cities it is also possible .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing moves in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the height of the rent .
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what Purch@@ ases Wa@@ ste in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive above all . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are hired only by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; a pity , there are almost no special deals and what is left of it will disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where is the farmer market hall supposed to go during the construction period ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit of the bit , after some time , actually comes . &quot;
or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery manage to sell all shops from Bit@@ burg beforehand ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s just not going to work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping centre , which stands empty , nobody needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching res@@ emb@@ lance : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible , hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ers and Haar@@ segments that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st d@@ ashed a 35 @-@ year sentence , making it public as a secret diplomatic report on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
a new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and pioneering Dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; because of the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the 30 portraits , the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification than a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ umps and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president Chel@@ sea@@ worthy judgment would transform and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually claimed only a few days after the book was published , man &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome way of a happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by including the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides after the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological regard , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective it is , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ icy Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle mentioned above . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a free spre@@ e in hand from the discipline of the United States , such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they turn down your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ utes Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ ose b@@ umps , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , right up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , man &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who wanted to be a suspect after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
&quot; on Monday , he issued arrest warran@@ ts for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a public warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives investigating the engra@@ vings as murder while the police actively search for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
since 2007 he has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ase , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ edia was now in a state of absence and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal off@@ ence examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ illi . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want him to set himself .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he appe@@ aled the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a mysterious hint that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was not clear whether the incident took place on July 27th , too . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that laun@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , resear@@ ching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ driver Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to meet the code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not have anything to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list suggests , however , that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged publicly funded dop@@ ing in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has been an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not give something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Mu@@ ko &apos;s words agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody tried to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the Moscow headquarters in July , WA@@ DA CEO Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
this was shared by the Group groups .
&quot; it was a pure precau@@ tion , and no health impair@@ ment could be assumed , it was said in the announcement . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only the eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il anti @-@ lice fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to provide clarity and transparency with its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
she has called for help from the outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software @-@ analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment . &quot;
he said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap Sur@@ vey@@ s and Sur@@ vey@@ s of certain Teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low approval results - so you can re@@ bo@@ p why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture , you must not be the next U@@ ber who has been engaged in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee wrote a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the finance @-@ technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ gence , the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ fall in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convert has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , the Trans@@ cent Company lets you send customised &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of convert . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that handles his staff badly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ ting , employee turnover and suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ gence has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their company headquarters . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company uses Conver@@ gence , problems that were previously blocked by managers who were in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair competition - quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ gence offer their software as a service and burden the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to acquire the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; convert received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his total financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only missions . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ ts and G@@ lin@@ t used . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ ee when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties ple@@ dge to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company take no action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough or not at all , this can cause dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have too much reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , employees ask , &quot; &quot; Have you really listened to me ? &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was determined by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better binding of employees in a branch that is known for high revenue . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Wasser@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real hit mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday came to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA at 19 : 15 will start to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise reached from the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood were performing practical exercises .
they are to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before beginning of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on her three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices once the camp is finished , given the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which is already covered with foot@@ balls that will allow a prot@@ ector behind a gate post , no easy task will be . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video and of one exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I do not worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false news to third party audi@@ tors and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual checking , which may indicate results of the Fak@@ ten@@ review from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they do not manage to quickly eradi@@ cate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings just as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook promised in a separate declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts check will be launched . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tual review of third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test its feature on the &quot; related articles , &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger history , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze Music Video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy sitting in the irrig@@ ation river valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ed Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says rejo@@ icing . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , &quot; a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he emotion@@ ally found emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thumb of the thumb on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were himself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) this all seems too beautiful to be true .
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ aping , gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing who what was : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go down ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ght@@ Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
perhaps both of them are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ ter that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who has staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s &quot; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always paying debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to promote hei@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences &quot;
&quot; he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature again . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the inauguration of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enkap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team aim to keep Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , write them on their yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honne@@ fer we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than just a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; after all , she stands in competition with other local authorities . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef generates a mean fifth @-@ digit amount and costs its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , Ankara is advis@@ ing the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) on pensions and promotions in the officers cor@@ ps . &quot;
so this week .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as was previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the heads of state , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population . &quot;
the government is attracting the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remained in office , but the Commander of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees the Erdo@@ gan as a wi@@ dow of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; for 486 people , who should have been involved directly in the coup attempt , Ankara is being negotiated in Ankara for this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan described the attempt to overthrow a &quot; &quot; religious gift &quot; &quot; since he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really hold the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in lifting the head@@ scarf ban on female soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
the big car in the army and the security forces continues at any rate .
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan had more 73@@ 95 citizens fired by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered the real masters of the country .
&quot; three times , they cast their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan ur@@ ges the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform directives of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan drives ahead of the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ges have doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he intends to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented Visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by giving US the way citizens from other countries are spent green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to refurb@@ ish course for pav@@ ement car parking
over the past few months over the past few months have been argu@@ ing about the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les - now it should go quite fast .
&quot; even before the end of the year , the route to which the tourist railway is to be built is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les long @-@ term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction works should start on the track this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route of Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this most important connection , &quot; explained traffic state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of rep@@ airing the track was about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country is 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is now defini@@ tively coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ ing@@ ian Railway as operators are already unanim@@ ous about the technical details .
&quot; thus the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; in this way , the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g stations .
&quot; in the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also heavily b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought that 2017 could not be even more crazy , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their Ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ atri@@ sts have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are reached by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his convic@@ tions and select everything , from the eye color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
but it becomes more distur@@ bing as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would be progres@@ sively looking for a step@@ ford woman .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the real@@ tion@@ ix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired of being fixed on conversation , or she can &quot; be in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ missive feminine features , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ bs one most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy provided on his website with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t males then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it is said on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R shows their increasing popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what tran@@ spir@@ es out of the marginal zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened globally in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ising women to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most det@@ err@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) is not the graphical images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the stu@@ ffed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : maid
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
&quot; it has become a fall@@ out of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of relative relationships .
we are all o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly strain all of us to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of bringing up the pumps , families . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tish poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; everyone whom she knows , including the repub@@ lican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ arly on the same side . &quot;
&quot; it is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it comes down to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the pres@@ i@@ ding effect of its pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and plat@@ former , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that the bi@@ bs of one day will no longer be b@@ ump@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a more fri@@ ghtening long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the ri@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; if plat@@ former goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ousel of the New York park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ un@@ chy and the animals turn to look at full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
thirty @-@ five years later and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the subject @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a major round@@ about in northern London .
&quot; however , the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since two years old , an 11 year old and two women can walk on it in the 40 @-@ ies and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have rated the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to settle the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ ing down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gr@@ ins@@ ing , while I was tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moves from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts in his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; according to Mor@@ des , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first kill sentence for murder after an appeal to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly in@@ tru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to include this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ator said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger , that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers from F@@ ully and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen have been released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol of the dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes were elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , a young eagle , who grows up in the chicken yard , but then dischar@@ ged into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar performed a musical entitled &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken yard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , leaving it out of his chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a hen @-@ bush , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him fell , and the eagle stretched out its wings on a high mountain , and sw@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ dd@@ les , the cylinder wore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eag@@ les stand for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonging to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished for every quad@@ ru@@ ple that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always comes up with instruc@@ tional passes , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over now , declared teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she left her students very reluc@@ tant because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ class wat@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song from summer@@ time and holiday season . &quot;
thereby great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ class wat@@ chers are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people were arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have ti@@ ghtened control over the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay in a place , which is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are designed to improve emission levels of Euro 5 and some Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europa offers assessments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no . the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; the binding updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fit has arranged the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the next few months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler announces that each person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its framework . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fits go altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this depends on the commitment of manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily at the topic of the environment . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first r@@ apper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the converts . &quot;
the awards will be given in the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
&quot; the prize @-@ winner of the award winner Le@@ ar announced , therefore , already announced to ref@@ rain from participation at the gala . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clear their views . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy Center , named after the former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente next year . &quot;
&quot; the job is already written out , however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a master of Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he convey@@ s in the press room .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfill the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next possible time .
&quot; in this way , with regard to the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time to prepare . &quot;
&quot; da Has@@ lach works for the administration community as a sub @-@ contractor , the applicant must present appropriate conclusions . &quot;
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill it out again , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city is important to the city and to him , says W@@ acker who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in ministry , a number of important projects have been gathered , and the W@@ acker looks back with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz are about to be encountered . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will strike at some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city building master large clearance .
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gardening , you can react flexibly to many things . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by the citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what is suitable , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring Stadt@@ bau@@ meister emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is the client , &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
&quot; he can count on long @-@ term employees for support and coordination : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Scho@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor will remain long , says W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify himself with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
those who wish to buy Roland W@@ acker should be able to provide a completed academic or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of building planning and construction planning law .
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction gui@@ deline planning , gr@@ ass@@ land matters , administration of urban properties , municipal estate with building yard and urban mi@@ stress as well as the lower civil rights authority , including monument protection . &quot;
thrown on pi@@ pel@@ ines : South @-@ track closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway slide in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and look for them since the night hours .
near the scene a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Lausanne region , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
he or the perpetr@@ ator would have brought himself in great danger and also endangered the traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail freight transport , P@@ ön@@ ellen of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be guided without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; almost ten cars were dropped off Friday morning , two of them watched the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; goods were not cancelled , but they were late . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate might help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , affecting about 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in food do not enter into the body . &quot;
cells that are able to trigger infections are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of proteins of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and an at@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich diet would be more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ do@@ k@@ tor@@ an@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was however separated , this did not have . &quot;
&quot; it presum@@ ed that the difference to the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and six species of bacteria were found found in mice with the immune cells but were lacking in mice .
mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria appeared to the immune system , the researchers left L. Cross in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. Cross in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts protect . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. Cross develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells operate inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of signature from Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup kick@@ ed off on Tuesday , and impressed the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira inv@@ aded at will . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic had , however , been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic they also started Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u at the Avi@@ va Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent in this week revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State Washington , but drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing already had such advertising before .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new low stop for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ democratic Prime Ministers have always looked towards Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire from the party central , but no counter @-@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were failures .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not rain reliably , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial power network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015 Leg@@ gi tut@@ to &quot;
five months before the election of the country his red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ voice @-@ majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner urged the stub@@ born low @-@ Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return its mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear for@@ gery of the voters &apos; will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and Elec@@ toral Campaign Director of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; that may not be true , &quot; &quot; si@@ ghs an SPD voting ball@@ room , when on Friday morning the new job message reaches the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the surrender of the green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional high point of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly considerable defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades settled down at his time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
that was the case - and everything was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; pain@@ stak@@ ingly , the comrades r@@ apped again in the weeks after that . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had developed new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came . &quot;
and with him came the next depression .
&quot; mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD head of the SPD , lost his ni@@ mo@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
and because in times of crisis communication he made pretty much wrong what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW gas aff@@ ection and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has already been critic@@ ised for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , in the past few weeks , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents in the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not hide his comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l does not blame for the party internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz no longer at all .
&quot; at times , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the stub@@ born parliam@@ ent@@ ar@@ ist T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Ms T@@ westen puts out their own career choices on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; not because of her personality as a direct candidate , Mrs. T@@ westen has been elected by the national list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens in the parliament , so the Dutch deputy far@@ ther . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD parliamentary group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; reluc@@ tance four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career in a future CD@@ U dep@@ u@@ ties distor@@ ts the election outcome , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called on clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ors for local nucleus III
who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon get assistance from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EG were informed on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , it has been living in sensi@@ ti@@ zing areas of san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the total funding . &quot;
&quot; in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is also important to promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the Karlsruhe government Pres@@ i@@ dium that there will be a reconstruction zone III . &quot;
&quot; the total amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros come from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
how does a renovation area come into being ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area in general interest , to rehabil@@ itate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area borders may then move again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , the ST@@ EC represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state @-@ federal programme &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Stadt &quot; &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the revit@@ alisation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 , the grant period for the subsidies ended on 1 January 2017 . &quot;
&quot; until September this year , however , the inventory should be carried out once more , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionn@@ aire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the charter of the sentence should take place as soon as possible , so that the restructuring will be started next year . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the said preliminary investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is about evaluating and deciding the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances , when rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
he emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; where it deals among other things about the structural state and the restructuring plans . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; budget and housing curve , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if in the building business premises are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be noted that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler insi@@ sted that the distribution of the funds was functioning according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - first comes first . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t book any funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Stadt@@ kern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot;
British invent@@ or places himself a micro@@ chip in order to get a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that the American production in the last month costs , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s data up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was issued alongside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , following the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event of high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second crew would need for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight was during the event by helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane . &quot;
&quot; from the records provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy Commander . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation when the presidential jet made his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to set up the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; as a dump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden on none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in setting out the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to hourly rates of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for refund rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the provision rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man &apos;s car . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tri@@ cky task
leading the 2nd tennis Bundes@@ liga is the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel on the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; despite the five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable , the top riders of the Second Tennis League made sense of the reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in a quite similar formation . &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV there are above all imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup .
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us . &quot;
&quot; you need a good dose of luck , too . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the far north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; if at the moment the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man is not part of the Bundes@@ liga @-@ game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will participate in this season at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lad@@ nik @-@ Castillo was on the ball with the White rus An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot;
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; for the 18 year old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , someone from the trainer fills the cad@@ re by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can harm the OM@@ V
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he set out his signature on Wednesday evening under the law of ti@@ ghtening the sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels rock@@ ed against the US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors have been troubled by the local OM@@ V , which together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Baltic Sea @-@ Baltic Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ ones are enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would even have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order . &quot;
there are twelve weapons at his disposal .
&quot; the press &quot; viewed itself , which the Group could aver@@ t and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the newest bu@@ cks of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of the world drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful diplom@@ ats , they operate as &quot; Fort@@ une 500 companies &quot; only with more government bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ hin@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ hin@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ id@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities invites to support the war against drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll backwards : the city has 46 kitchen aids
the city re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock is reserved .
&quot; on 1st September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the field of youth welfare , is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the house , a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooled refriger@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the city operates 46 day @-@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week are eating lunch in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff will have kitchen service starting September 1 : they heat the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , propor@@ tioning the meal individually , place the meal , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ units @-@ units - decides on the hour @-@ circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more integrated , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to put into practice ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the Chi@@ ch@@ enk@@ raft to the team is meaningful .
for the children too .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the ch@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of kitchen performance , has also the charm that they have proved to be the most economical in cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign disp@@ ense for the city as the most economical . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
Afghan Democracy depends on the political role of women the UN says
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ dn , official leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will channel in the provinces in the elections . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ pres@@ idents and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women are fully participating and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
Taliban have released threats to a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat actions to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ sh@@ om said , a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot;
&quot; the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters registered . &quot;

two young men aged 19 and 23 will have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 year old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to information from the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who got up with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl with the mobile phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; then one of the offen@@ ders tried to attack the mobile phone and the N@@ eckl@@ ace of the girl , however . &quot;

the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern over investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to wi@@ pe out the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has weigh@@ ed over the future of investments at the cross site location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which includes other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; first experience &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; &quot; to express concern that funding for modernis@@ ing production lines is not advanced . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross as General @-@ Site manager concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow city area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic process of production , the east end of Glasgow badly needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has just received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond immediately as we value the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continuously check our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the past few years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our cross cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona for@@ e@@ warn N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La Liga likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t let N@@ ey@@ mar ref@@ rain from releasing an offer of £ 189 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the league 1 club is ready to break the world record more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and to the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan leader insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign up one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ ot@@ ers dropped and damaged
&quot; in the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown killer has deliberately turned a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the property number 30 , and thus caused a damage of more than 200 Euro in the fair@@ ing of the vehicle . &quot;

&quot; in an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , police are looking for witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because a car came to meet him in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and then touched the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction to Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the b@@ ypass tunnel of Stol@@ zen@@ au there was a car in front of him , so that he had to devi@@ ate to the right . &quot;
the Tour@@ an driver touch@@ touched the guiding principle .
&quot; on the passenger car , they did a bad harm . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident injured , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the cause of the cause , to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report to the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen takes care of discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ person for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; stated after publication vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur . it was an ap@@ ology from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ fied Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false estim@@ ation of the processes .
&quot; the Vatican weekly &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence in the domain @-@ cats with &quot; two kinds of measure . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the enc@@ ro@@ achment in Regensburg , nobody doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of design@@ ating the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it to normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; you are happy to go to the church and that &apos;s a fres@@ co@@ ed fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical instrument &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) with R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , instruc@@ ted by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other alleg@@ ations , many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in numerous cases even have positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Ez@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; incidents of violence exercise at shel@@ ters at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize their &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist that became tangible when a dom@@ spark didn &apos;t have a top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ever occurs in it . &quot;
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of the complic@@ ity of the mid@@ d@@ le@@ men or fel@@ lows in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool happened outside of his sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can be accused of having experienced too late or having taken first hints not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the secondary school gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as literally &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; of practically all respon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; thus , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger provides a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained of his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to rage . &quot;
&quot; he did not only b@@ ang with chairs and threw the Schl@@ us@@ selb@@ und onto the floor , but also distributed ear@@ pieces and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself regre@@ ts already years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , this is ad@@ mitt@@ edly bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
one wonders whether it &apos;s not with his fame and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI &apos;s story that many media have just rus@@ hed onto him .
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still busy . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the context of the report , it was reported a lot about the abuse of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put some involvement or a pity in regards to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault pre@@ tended to be entrusted with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a person acting on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in clari@@ fying sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who had been professionally a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
what is the role of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ pup@@ il R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a sought @-@ after student formulated it thus : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ gs more intr@@ usive or clearer or rather opened than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust@@ ees , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of the report on the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the student and / or their environment affected him in advance , could not be confirmed in the examination . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , George R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any staff . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused of being prevented or placed to adver@@ tise it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these obj@@ ection@@ able crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former dome master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything mixes and ming@@ led with a huge amount of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; there is clearly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other repro@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. , for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful examination ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly school@@ ed and mal@@ ol@@ erable , were all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first , when they were already on the cath@@ eter school gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , as most witnesses emphasize , the theme of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot;
&quot; one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; paradise &quot; &quot; states . &quot;
what was different on the cath@@ edr@@ als gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself , and from the events at a school where he didn &apos;t work and was responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consequently dev@@ oured the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the secondary school gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out that , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; even in light of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent transgres@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pun@@ ishments have long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , it occurred in a legal gray area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where the per@@ missible limit was really exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he always looked away . &quot;

only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; trap of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger of judging the past according to modern moral standards . &quot;
the princess is already right .
&quot; but , of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ in@@ able and also not for what was supp@@ ressed at the pres@@ ch@@ ool of in@@ viol@@ ability and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that which was at that time . &quot;
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be upgraded .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is , to drag the ears and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has played Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of exam@@ in@@ ers also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI says from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t deny that he carried out a rig@@ orous reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without claiming un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and cand@@ y alone , you do not have a big vo@@ cal@@ ist and before every success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deeply believing and heart@@ felt person , from whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get in contact with him , how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , visit him regularly , visit him , he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , father @-@ like teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lov@@ able dis@@ respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and who ad@@ ore them down@@ right . &quot;
&quot; and please , again very clearly : all things you repro@@ ach him are educational methods , which were on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time for a long time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the An@@ war would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has earned great mer@@ its and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to leave in peace . &quot;
