<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"a Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel where it is now digged for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small-gardeners manage the former bottom of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows who had to get upset because the car-navigation system was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria, are anything but up-to-date - yet very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large picture postcard was incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called primeval petals."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were created according to the Bavarian surveying management, between 1810 and 1864, and originate from Bavaria's first surveying."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the spring 1800, the French military leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bayerns - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops were finally withdrawn with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, the" Topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The cover sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Untersendlings' houses are concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was renamed in 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasantry against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming there appears a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called" "original survey" "from which the property was deduced."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small parcels today no longer occupy farmers - but small-gardeners of the plant" "Land in Sun". ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz of the October festival, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district, Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" at Gasteig "or" On the Sky "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there, 1858 / 59, the Munich District Irving anstalt" On the Auer Lüften "was created."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, related to the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he prohibited the personnel to use force against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the prison. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, first place was first, later it was extended to 500 seats."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity no longer sufficed - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrist."</seg>
<seg id="40">"at the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people in the Munich area of Salesianum meet."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with training establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"to the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "- in architectural accordance with the original structure of the Irving Institution, was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "Main Square", "the" "Kaufingerstrasse" "was called" "Kaufingerstrasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies rised many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel dating back to the Middle Ages were once stood by Marienhof, where these days took the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn station."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes a warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to promote coloured people has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Missouri State, which is to come into force by August 28, 2017, prompts afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention during travel through the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and be noted here," says the Group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities that are disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to extract the warning, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, human beings."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are halted because of their skin color, they are struck or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group quoted incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol over the country and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the General Prosecutor of Missouri, which is shown that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be halted."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be ready to bring interest, or let their relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hasslebrechts report of the FBI, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company due to housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, having agreed to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest the local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to further racial profiling according to the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidecaun project is a success project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU parliamentarians Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"the owners of the Fischerbacher CDU-village together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the grounds of the Hudemann family-estate, together with mayor Thomas Schneider."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he cultivated 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many kittens and accommodated in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the chairman of the Bank of Fishermen's bach, he called the electric fence project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't generate profitable on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"green landfill provision for a lot of work, much needs to be worked with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it did not lead to a bioeconomy."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader subsidy. "</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers must be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">Hope that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," the mayor insisted. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized for their promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"over the electric fence, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the preservation area amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted by half over leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "explained Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landladies it's not possible."</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß was also standing firm: "the best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landschaftspark Breeding Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state support of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the preservation of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a grant given by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the area to be fenced must not be tugable (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the 2018 fisherman's electric fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence is currently underway."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the conservation area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Platz in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals to drastically limit the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller consented not the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of shipowners and Liberty imitation would have gynked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he assumed their importance, and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... is a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is really right, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your idleness, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who are longing to breathe freely, / the elusive rubbish of your wealthy coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "wrecking apostasy" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller insisted not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a quite different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame to the world around:" Lady liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elusive but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not light the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the United Kingdom Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which will start on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "something special in Scotland" "has to be developed and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue to figure it out until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butlers - who are competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captains" speech was incredible, "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh naturally brought in, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medalist, who will compete in the fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads on this path and last year established five British and two European recorders.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that you should watch for a great season, which included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being part of team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to go on platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think they went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blockers of Critics via Facebook: don't charm you around a public office if you cannot tolerate the natives of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked in the critique, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"there are profiles of leading retailers, with analysis of their performance and the challenges they face."</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union was complaining about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the cry as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it's a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican deputy in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary sharper head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play his haarless head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons coming to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, is considered official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the governors' actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I said politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other latest news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea even if a number of people occupy the same subject, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor described as" concentrated spam attack, "others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or erasing a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest and silence protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"President of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County hurt the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable sex had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters sent on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous troll.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticised its position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence them.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten place. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here are building everything they eat: above all Nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can always edit four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They retain the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>

<seg id="364">Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, restrictions of reporting international media remain tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although rare permission was given to them."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis election campaign, the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development, were not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia's uneven easternmost provinces of Papua and Western papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua including the Paniai foundry."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir pointed out the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases.

<seg id="374">"when an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but would like to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai committees," says Gobai, president of the tribal council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, except that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a" fault "that he must pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money; they want only justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai victims resulted in a last symbolic act of defiance: the corpses of a victim were buried on a site exactly against the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know they may never give justice to them, but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius' Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery-site in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16 at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The saving and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tumblgens to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. HilariusChapel was first documented in the" "Württembergischer Urgent Design" ": Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogabbey at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the words of the deed, on Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, there was also a glorious court, to which the church or the patronal right belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the town-image of Tumlingen, the" "mountain" "is the third, the most blessed settler nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 strengthen these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronal law originated from the early medieval peculiarities of its own.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a pastor continued to remain the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger of the two shattered on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly acquired bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were inlaid and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in 1796, French troops camped near the church."</seg>
<seg id="485">"they removed the pulpit and the church chairs, and used them as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius graveyard was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary Church aborted.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Night of 1834, a storm split the steeple and half sank."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the still existing tower of tower survived as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius facility as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">"as organisers, the friends and supporters of Tumlin invite to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to the St. HilariusChapel."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The forerunner Hartmut Romann speaks the foreword.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is at 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"at the end of the serenade, there is a trunk in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest, the organizers take out the fantastic view."</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of importance for tumours and listeners."</seg>

<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim wills itself" has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only at the border of Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone exists."</seg>
<seg id="509">"within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are meant to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had determined a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days before, but the district government Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a form mistake."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning law, the approval of approval is still unlawful and therefore to be taken back," "said Christoph Erkens, chairman of" "Boisheim". ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: the city council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette before the summer break; a permit from the District Government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of approximately 11,400 households will be covered - this corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW CD will invest some 20 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="583">"it is really incomprehensible that in all these years, no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations, although we know who they are," "said Tyrone Brooks, assisting in organizing the postures."</seg>
<seg id="584">"it is a dirt spot on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."</seg>
<seg id="585">Brooks is a 71-year-old former minister of the state of Georgia and a life long civil rights lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="586">"for him, the postage serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual commemoration of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected."</seg>

<seg id="590">"according to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding neighborhoods were suspected in the lynching process."</seg>
<seg id="591">But none has ever been charged.</seg>
<seg id="592">"although the suspects remain open for decades, citizens say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>

<seg id="640">They have experienced Georgian oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks translates her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">"up to this point the murders have been an anecdote, but now when one stands on the same country where the Lynch-killers took place, the air feels spooky."</seg>
<seg id="642">"when the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse."</seg>
<seg id="643">"children squat their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other."</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," mumbles a little boy, as if he wanted to remember. "</seg>
<seg id="645">After a few minutes Greene wishes to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over.</seg>

<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older while in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing uninterrupted issues from the European soccer clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to forbid crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid $222 million (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar writes down and brings him to a galaxy of other stars, in the face of the financing of the team by the Kingdoms family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to counteract legitimate income sources that allow them to reach the break-even point in their activities on football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then heavily invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - become a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP event period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"even though Platini has fallen from the Presidency in the United States in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive expenses."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a package, it may distribute the amount for the invoice on the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the sum up of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements can be expended for the next five years."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a cash penalty of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could attempt to outwit their financial supervision by imposing their income through companies connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Neymar on payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"but PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar's World Cup will be ambassadors, and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators is easy to figure out."</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain" "sluggish" "when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the Monetary Committee's policy makers (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members to increase in this month because weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in their quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and from 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would likely rise to just under 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signalized that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to curb the inflation rate infected by the Brexit, and it said that the credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also agreed to withdraw part of the mammoth business package which was issued a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the next February, although it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the rate of interest, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a" somewhat bigger "scale than the markets expected."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank emphasized that" "incremental" "and" "limited" "would take place."</seg>

<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for a zinc increase, and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months."</seg>

<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which compensates for a portion of lower consumption expenditures."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the lowering of the pounds."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final verdict on the rate of interest rates, the call for a zinc increase increased because inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation declined from 2.9% last month in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and will be attracting them again in the coming months."</seg>

<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montargue, director of Coreco mortgage Brokers, said:" "in view of the recent decline of swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are loudly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way."</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight in front of the High Court for the financing of the drug in the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylactic prophylactic (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study of approximately 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice, confirming that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the allegation that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as" important new intervention, "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduced the HIV transmission in cases of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who come into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics are identified suitable candidates who consent to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the overall potential of prep by examining clinical evidence, as used in a large scale, and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said:" this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV. "</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, when it is targeted at vulnerable and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We sincerely welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"said Mr Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"said Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society a step closer."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living Your Big Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, took place in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add a Joanne storage room and mezzanine to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think creatively, in order to redeem the announcement."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it wasn't just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture; silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," Erfan explains from the reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweight so that when you slide the door, it slides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to clever use of space and storage room, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't fall into the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>

<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now covers offices in the Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>

<seg id="1364">This means that Colin property has a value of $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of issue for Paul.</seg>

<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports on news media - hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, on his first day of work with executive employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to fix: poor information thrown into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to be convinced," "said the former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep the tiness of Twitter habit controlled, according to six former elections officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Date: 06 / 14 / 2009</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that" "Twitter custom" "was ever" "under control" "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something else we don't know - that afflicted tweets without their interventions would have included more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff made it a few times to keep annoyance from him, their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently been able to prevent trough controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, repeatedly attempt to advance their own agenda by promoting trump material that may potentially promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former dump officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February when someone malicious a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of the chicane, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced wrong accusations in the past and revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Ump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork and document the dump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self and his advisors are still striving for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is made up of the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house is heated by electricity. 2 bathrooms with shower. 2 toilets.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and receipts from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt sailors Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with its managing director Birgit Scherer has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter building.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"hot Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction shuttles have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time and when one enters the house it becomes clear, which extensive renovations are made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were pulled out, blankets, partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>

<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the black walnut style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread widely, explains Scherer further."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Intermediator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russian affair around U.S. President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the committee has taken up the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "referring to the matter familiar people."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper reported the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there are already initial invitations of the Gremian in connection with a meeting between the eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accused the Kremlin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there was agreement between Trumps Elective campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, there are several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps of private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Special Encounter snipped personally into the center and investigate whether the President might hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges are to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jurys are also called" "Prosecution". ""</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are mostly switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the meeting, people who were involved in the meeting were asked to say it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"next to Trump Jr there were also trumps counselors and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his former campaign manager Paul Manafort in the interview."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the exposure show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the case of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme will give the democrats a chance to" feel good, "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement, he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"this work is also usually in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House recommends any measures that accelerated the work of the Special intermediary in a "fair manner."</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to accept that something has changed, in the Declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump have been loud, he would hamper the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said before a Senate Committee in June, reportedly asked him for an attitude of investigation against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The purest speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent mediator of Congress such as Watergate affair around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"several senators of both parties, however, want to prevent such a step."</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented legislation on Thursday after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed so easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic Eisberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has released itself from the seven-fold size of Berlin by the Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus, which is heavy and 5800 square kilometres, now runs north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice-giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change played a role in the abruption of the ice age is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, for about 30 years, there has been a series of unusual eruptions of ice cream in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"until now, the broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It always grows further into the sea and stops regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this shelf life, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disrupted several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelfeisen can be found there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that even the Larsen-C-Schelfeisen is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice-plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece is broken down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level because they float on the water and displace ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a small extent, the British research project writes to the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeisen is the fourth-largest shelf of Antarctica according to AWI data of almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the junction from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and no direct connection to climate change is aware of us, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists argue, whether the Larsen-C Schelfeiter will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers did not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, there have been a lot of ice-chocolates in the Antarctic peninsula in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long stretch of Antarctica covers South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">To decrease was the increase in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the last 50 years, making the temperature most steep."</seg>

<seg id="1567">The speech is from a regular "competition by the public employers."</seg>

<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warn that they must not continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their crew had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself in detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we can't operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in a statement on social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge all allegations, which are currently being collected, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew assumes inflatable migrants who are delivered directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coastguard, which monitors the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct boats, like the Iuventa, must first have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable, since they would not bring any" substantial changes or handicaps "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Peace Laureate Organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti, meanwhile, said that the number of migrants, who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations, declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal guards and co-operation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim on hot summer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"the following Viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream planes."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were repeatedely longer ascents, for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"once again, a viewpoint at the lookout point, connected by" flowery "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, there were again many altimeters."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and handmade huts brought some welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed into brine in the open-air inhalatorium."</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt has been controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 altitude metres, the group had become acquainted with the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawns - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in future, the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the stadium in wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and giant tourneys with high levels."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this has also been recognised by the first federal states, who are increasingly involved in this area."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "that there are several clubs rising on this train." ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">"the FIFA World Cup will be organising the first" Interactive Club World Cup "in London this weekend, where the gamers of various clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Also Robin Dutt sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football has to deal with the 14-30 year-olds, that the young people will also go into the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-sportsmen under contract, you could be present online much more often on these markets than once a year send the federal ligaments to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"at E-Sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the football simulation FIFA are challenged on competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"for a long time, as in the normal sport, it is established, in which the pros compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, e-sports is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobbing dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player." ""</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobang also sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to perform in online games and in the scene the structures of classical sports lacked.</seg>
<seg id="1639">"in a positive way, the scientist emphasizes the highly integrative effect of E-Sports."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are travelling internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) precedes rapid growth to the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales of 130 million are expected."</seg>
<seg id="1644">That is not enough for the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes the Deloitte consultants. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already further.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Big markets are Asia and the USA where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participated in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood Actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">There is a lot happening in Europe too.</seg>

<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and in France, the football first league associations according to Dutt are now obliged to set up an E-Sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lags behind," explains VfB Management Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, is no longer enough."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"it is about keeping the tradition of the association, but to align the company at the same time on the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitalized world," says Dutt. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">"a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years, because she has encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed to parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced to life in June for a casual killing by Conrad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is inseparable.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argue that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward-looking eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have reversed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"but Carters lawyer said it was a" "awful circumstance that they deplore completely." ""</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said however, he did not find out that her" age or maturity "or even their mental illness has a significant influence on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a prosecutor also read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us, for his sisters to be there," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Gary's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"not having the only person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain I will keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a coal oxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide, she wrote:" "you must do it, Conrad" "and" "All you need to do is turn the generator and you'll be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter was seeking attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"to the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox was convicted for murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly newspaper Riodosia meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They have been told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists will discuss what is more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the Reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest in the violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter are their editors and their inspirer of Riodosia, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared themes that trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodosia, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inseparable and even though the terrain is still more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodosia in the province capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelfth River. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing but silence on Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of distorted, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug merchandise routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodosia, broke down with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed Gangmembers bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to not compel Valdez, after confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US-Dollar investments."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the poison gas problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodosia, she received the prestigious" Maria Moors Cabot Prize "for her reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task you assign to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead men... why didn't you tell what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodosia team missed Valdez, the river-bird, who was able to curb like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now ask them, 'Is his love to the routine his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their job best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret wings and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust your own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells incorrect, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is, the editor of Riodosia Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier is happening. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodosia met for safety training suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold solely to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen tried protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters surveyed whether these officers are among the 50 per cent of the policemen who owned the governor themselves as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodosia has looked on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group located in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, belonging to the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the entire century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we knew what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El Flaco" "because of his slender body keyboard."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the Valdez office became a storage room for signs and stickers, which protest against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched a few notes and went to a demonstration in the morning for another journalist for the office of the public prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Micoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned physique was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder, having written down in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and constructions."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and attempts to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez denounced the authorities to spy on journalists and to kill them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has asked since then that she is reclassified by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, the government officials involved and an equally valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die, because they want you to keep the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>

<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is difficult to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for hazards."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City for three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described it as" the upholstered dinosaur, who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodose-dinosaur living in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved state has amazed researchers, who describe it as" really remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that was out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earth-dumps."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blew a little with the eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this herbivores, although it is covered with an armor and is similar to a walking tank, probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter shading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed us to mix well into its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurs family has made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preserved specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that the evolution was favoring the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this nodose-dinosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong booty behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal in indications of his life, including his preserved intestines, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much farther widely distributed than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodose-rier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preservated skin, but also remains in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the beast," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just take a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the cycle time was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaurus, which stood on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20 inches long spikes that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater coverage of the dinosaur preserved its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the doorsteps still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is so 'rare as a win in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers crossed upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1974">"on the Autobahn Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"according to the first data of the police, there were nearly 30 vehicles between the junction stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, among them probably trucks."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there is no information about the exact number of injured."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it is an easy to moderate injury, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">"in the Munich direction, there was a setback of approximately ten kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as a AZ-reporter reports, it also came on the counter-road to massive disabilities - by numerous gaff."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle handlemen, who now have to reckon with sensitive punishments."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45, a second accident happened on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing reminding you in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just an ingenious thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffered.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the reckless card control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by using your mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devaluethe ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">"currently, a test run runs on two tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer arrives, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will probably be available in many other long-haul routes in Germany in the beginning of next year," said a railway spokesman. "</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" refers to the fairlead devaluation without sheepsake.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be met: one needs a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And one has to have booked an online ticket - which already do most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works like this: one gets into the train, calls out his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"when the driver comes to place Y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so one can continue to sleep, keep on working, keep quiet."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"the" "check-in" "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn makes use of the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel without ticket control by our train crew, checked in the DB Navigator just themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2010">"this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB Fernverkehr. "</seg>
<seg id="2011">"second plus:" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">"who often runs train, knows that besides delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the biggest nuisances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"for many times you have, in any case, one of the fellow travelers not all the documents that you need to depreciate online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or the identity card, or any other document you have to show."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in the control of your own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of time to take care of other matters."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this applies only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further train numbers on the same route are not unlocked yet.</seg>

<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She set off her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people who cried out, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who bore a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman captured his gun and cried," "I will kill you... animals all slay."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," "said Ferrell to her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11 o'clock she fetched her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from the 11th."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the sight of people who live in communion and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a rell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take it with me," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any disgusting racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the impossible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">"slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's figure."</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan arrived, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to" document, "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to mind," Will you want to document or try to find a story you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently said in an interview:" "we had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism rum for death-detainees."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to Ferrell, along with six other natives, the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, as I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferres's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the generalization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">Ferris's story also repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin have marked the film" Blacklive Matter "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although it was at the front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the security cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings to a voice and she feels bound to this memory since she went into the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while some say to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" does not need a human being "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while proponents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the remaining shops also profit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian precinct is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction work, it will conclude."</seg>
<seg id="2097">Galerie-Macher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and admittedly to the Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone's guestrooms: "we have been buying a farmer's market almost every week for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the countrywomen always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butchery we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and above all after building the gallery a chance exists to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities it is also possible.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing moves in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what Purchases Waste in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive above all."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping centre are hired only by larger companies, because the local rents are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, there are almost no special deals and what is left of it will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where is the farmer market hall supposed to go during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit of the bit, after some time, actually comes."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to sell all shops from Bitburg beforehand?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "that's just not going to work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping centre, which stands empty, nobody needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer market hall, thanks to the unbelievably many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no more place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible, hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and Haarsegments that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst dashed a 35-year sentence, making it public as a secret diplomatic report on WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">A new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and pioneering Dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"because of the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Manning, Dewey-Hagborg originated from the 30 portraits, the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification than a woman since puberty, was convicted of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumps and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a Comic" Suppressed Images "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president Chelseaworthy judgment would transform and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually claimed only a few days after the book was published, man's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome way of a happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition some deep and strong, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her superlarge signature (the" i "in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation, "the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological regard, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spicy Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the Comic-Novelle mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, as it appears with a free spree in hand from the discipline of the United States, such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they turn down your speech, then they have won," "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "so never stop your mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who salutes Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goose bumps, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacons, which are like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, right up to size (5" 2, man's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which was also behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who wanted to be a suspect after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, he issued arrest warrants for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Cook County Court."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A public warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead on the scene of the event, and detectives investigating the engravings as murder while the police actively search for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007 he has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubase, Vice President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Laedia was now in a state of absence and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal offence examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University collaborates with this investigation," "said Cubilli."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman at the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help U.S. investigators in any way possible."</seg>

<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"said Guglielmi, the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building that had just received a mysterious hint that said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the incident took place on July 27th, too."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that launthem and Warren were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria listed in the list suggests, however, that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged publicly funded doping in the Russian sport."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has been an error. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programmes, and we will not give something that does not exist."</seg>

<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales agency rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov announced problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"nobody tried to accept this report unconditionally," "added Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from WADA by the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger history, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze Music Video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy sitting in the irrigation river valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moped Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says rejoicing. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote" Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, "a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he emotionally found emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only reacted to the thumb of the thumb on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "this is his thumb-print!"</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were himself."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overrated my welcome greeting") this all seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, to see the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscaping, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" "Whiskey" "and started to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died."</seg>

<seg id="2309">"guys, let all go down!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled 'KnightFamilies of Kent and Sussex'," "says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought that an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps both of them are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', portrayed by the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who has staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"Darrells are Rhodes's" favorite family of Scotney: "gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always paying debts and spending money on things they could not afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys, with a talent to promote heirs."</seg>

<seg id="2319">"he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the area of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature again."</seg>

<seg id="2338">"every year at the beginning of August, Ankara is advising the Supreme Military Council (YAS) on pensions and promotions in the officers corps."</seg>
<seg id="2339">So this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2343">"under the chairmanship of the heads of state, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile-preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees the Erdogan as a widow of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"for 486 people, who should have been involved directly in the coup attempt, Ankara is being negotiated in Ankara for this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempt to overthrow a" "religious gift" "since he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really hold the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Discomfort in Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing" Islamization "of the army, which manifests itself among other things in lifting the headscarf ban on female soldiers, wrote the paper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The big car in the army and the security forces continues at any rate.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan had more 7395 citizens fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly considered the real masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they cast their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan urges the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform directives of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan drives ahead of the Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "a particularly unnamed officer, who sought asylum from fear of persecution in foreign countries, warned that the Turkish army will be" full of extremists and Salafists in a few years. ""</seg>
<seg id="2362">"if this is true, such a development could not be cold."</seg>

<seg id="2376">"in order to secure the future of the Rennsteishuttles long-term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction works should start on the track this year."</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and rehabilitate the route of Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country commits itself to this most important connection," explained traffic state Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of repairing the track was about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"of this sum, the country is 75 percent."</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that 2017 could not be even more crazy, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their Ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "said Mr Sharkey on the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpatrists have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are reached by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adapt" "his robot according to his convictions and select everything, from the eye color of the robot over the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" who would be progressively looking for a stepford woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the realtionix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they are appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," enthuses the site of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired of being fixed on conversation, or she can" be in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (i.e.: reluctant) Farrah, disturbs one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy provided on his website with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't males then have no Roxxxy?" "it is said on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just a different sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR shows their increasing popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what transpires out of the marginal zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"however, there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened globally in which there is a president in the White House who has been praising women to have sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') is not the graphical images, the entwined body and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are counterfeit slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a fallout of the trump era that the political divisions, which polarized the US voters, have also split families in small format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of relative relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all ostensibly strain all of us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noticed is the power of bringing up the pumps, families."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a leftish poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"it is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it comes down to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left has been strengthened by Trump, but the presiding effect of its presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalisation "and platformer, we refer to the spooky possibility that the bibs of one day will no longer be bumped."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is a more frightening long-term scenario, normalized in the riump republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return saw) - both in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild criminal offense."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"if platformer goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate might help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, affecting about 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while sufferers are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger infections are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance conducive immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of proteins of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. Cross and an atyptophan-rich diet would be more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was however separated, this did not have."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it presumed that the difference to the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found found in mice with the immune cells but were lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria appeared to the immune system, the researchers left L. Cross in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. Cross in our gastrointestinal tracts protect."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. Cross develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells operate inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan in the presence of L. Cross can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2676">"back then, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the total funding."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the previous renovations are a" success project "- it is also important to promote interior development, and not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, I received the information from the Karlsruhe government Presidium that there will be a reconstruction zone III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the total amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros come from the country, the rest of the community sensitivities."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a renovation area come into being?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will continue to investigate, as Schindler, where the" really old "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"but it also plays a role, whether in the planned area in general interest, to rehabilitate."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the area borders may then move again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"on Wednesday evening, the STEC represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"Keller presented the contents of the federal state-federal programme" "Soziale Stadt" "in which the renovations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be objective, i.e. per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The refurbishment area would finally be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">"from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026, the grant period for the subsidies ended on 1 January 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the inventory should be carried out once more, as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the charter of the sentence should take place as soon as possible, so that the restructuring will be started next year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"subsequently, Pietzschmann explained that each commune had to carry out the said preliminary investigations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"it is about evaluating and deciding the urbanistic grievances, when rehabilitated and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will once again come to sensations and make a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">He emphasised that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and property sheet", "where it deals among other things about the structural state and the restructuring plans."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the grey questionnaire, the" budget and housing curve, "data on size, distribution and residents of a living room can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">"the blue" "arc" "can only be filled out if in the building business premises are operated."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new construction measures are not eligible."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler insisted that the distribution of the funds was functioning according to the" "greyhound principle" "- first comes first."</seg>
<seg id="2705">"you can't book any funds for later." ""</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that the American production in the last month costs, costs taxpayers according to the military's data up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, made in Connecticut, was issued alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event of high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the hours a second crew would need for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight was during the event by helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," "answered the Deputy Commander."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the" "Made in America" "event was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But even official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus for reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use only for a photo operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation when the presidential jet made his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthusiastic about the show" Made in America "- the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials," said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crew frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to set up the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as a dump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 led the White House 58 exercise landings."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopter units flew in addition 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took the burden on none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in setting out the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 has no budget labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to hourly rates of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is most misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the provision rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but consider the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at this time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things produced in America this week," Spicer said. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to emphasize that."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fireman's car."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>

<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen takes care of discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesperson for the reform movement" We are the Church, "stated after publication vis-à-vis the Deutsche Presse-Agentur. it was an apology from former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerified Pope Benedict XVI."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false estimation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican weekly" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that in reporting on violence in the domain-cats with" two kinds of measure. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the encroachment in Regensburg, nobody doubt that it is" shameful and shameful acts "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of designating the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it to normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio:" "you are happy to go to the church and that's a frescoed frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows a completely normal pedagogical instrument" "had been" "to be done with naughty children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the" My Brother of the Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages) with Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, instructed by the diocese Regensburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other allegations, many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and, therefore, in numerous cases even have positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Ezemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "incidents of violence exercise at shelters at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students emphasize their" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist that became tangible when a domspark didn't have a top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger ever occurs in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the complicity of the middlemen or fellows in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool happened outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can be accused of having experienced too late or having taken first hints not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the secondary school gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as literally" "Redemption," "" "heaven" "and" "better world" "of practically all respondents."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger provides a very excellent testimony, describes him as" warm hearted, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained of his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to rage."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only bang with chairs and threw the Schlusselbund onto the floor, but also distributed earpieces and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself regrets already years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, this is admittedly bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it's not with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI's story that many media have just rushed onto him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still busy."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the context of the report, it was reported a lot about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put some involvement or a pity in regards to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault pretended to be entrusted with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," "said a person acting on behalf of the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who had been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the role of the Domspatzen-pupil Ratzinger's role in regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a sought-after student formulated it thus: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that... Bugs more intrusive or clearer or rather opened than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trustees, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"this is the result of the report on the very clear result:" "that the student and / or their environment affected him in advance, could not be confirmed in the examination."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, George Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any staff."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused of being prevented or placed to advertise it."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these objectionable crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media there was a lot of" "violent excesses" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former dome master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything mixes and mingled with a huge amount of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there is clearly separated: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other reproaches."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e., for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful examination pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadistic teachers were properly schooled and malolerable, were all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first, when they were already on the catheter school gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme of" preschool "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "paradise" "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the cathedrals gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and, therefore, in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he didn't work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consequently devoured the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, since in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the secondary school gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out that," that in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be practiced. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in light of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent transgressions."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test punishments have long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it occurred in a legal gray area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where the permissible limit was really exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">Date: 06 / 14 / 2009 Size:</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed it was unfair to apply today's educational standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" trap of anachronism, "thus the danger of judging the past according to modern moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not for what was suppressed at the preschool of inviolability and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that which was at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be upgraded.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplining and punishment, that is, to drag the ears and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he also kept strictly adhering to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time has played Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of examiners also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI says from his perspective, that the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't deny that he carried out a rigorous regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without claiming unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and candy alone, you do not have a big vocalist and before every success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heartfelt person, from whom one can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get in contact with him, how many former Domspatzen, still today, 23 years after his Emeritierung, visit him regularly, visit him, he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, father-like teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable disrespectful person, to which they still look up today and who adore them downright."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again very clearly: all things you reproach him are educational methods, which were on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the Anwar would command a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace."</seg>
