28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother suggested that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , and distributed the geri@@ atric department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was considered murder and the investigation is underway .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who formerly worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; shocked by death &quot; &quot; and were destroyed in the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia claimed that Frank was first living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gal@@ icia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; connecting his way with his family was to always cook something for us to prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any sort of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has the information in the case will be asked to call the deco@@ y of the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always plug@@ ged in a drawer
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ uous now in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;m always plug@@ ged into drawers or stick on the outside label , which mostly have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather snow@@ y . &quot;
&quot; Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress likes to spend their time at home , pre @-@ TV with a relaxed Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot;
the film will run on August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Pyram@@ id
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger looked for a little variation with a ride on the beach with some colleagues .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they drove home to the trou@@ ghs in a quick gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and thus the riding career ended again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he had his family run over the system of AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even look for photo purposes . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sport assistant handed the man out of An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden sport pyram@@ ids .
there is no shortage of the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete .
&quot; Grand Cross , Silver Lau@@ rel , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already made it .
long is the 18th prize @-@ winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , on Saturday , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 Euro as well . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master @-@ champion was included on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the winners were the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ wers Werner Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ wers Werner Han@@ isch , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports le@@ agues came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on , where the Lav@@ azza price ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Compar@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP &apos;s trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ just in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep things small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax@@ ing the economy to death and to regulate deaths , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ vo@@ ke regulations , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain duties to fulfil , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would be increased , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , dump and Clinton are almost word@@ less . &quot;
the democratic candidate demonstrates the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there could be bi@@ parti@@ san discussions on the dump .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and re@@ build coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement will cease . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and challenge the Renew@@ able Energy with its investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - also with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the Tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic Trade Agreement , do not want to sign either . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but rather simply protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should then be paid better , say Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ ust , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands the dump , which wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater .
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
&quot; escape : &quot; &quot; every escaped woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs almost to everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at the most one year old . &quot;
one has placed her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tabl@@ etop .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are chicken .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodation for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has created the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence in her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hop@@ eless carriers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; women predomin@@ ate other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , hon@@ our@@ able murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
it drives them away .
&quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , that tu@@ gs call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , is wrong , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , single @-@ standing women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big .
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations only for them , ur@@ ges B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer no . &quot;
there is no such thing as governments in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia .
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Francon@@ ia , there are some common shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation units exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are hosted separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is lacking , or will men and women be accommod@@ ated together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
how much women can feel this need of protection can be read at the An@@ d@@ rang in Munich .
&quot; since we have talked about that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily raise a second house .
assistant Denti@@ sts : demands for new work Campaign
representatives of the assistance specialists have called their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute over a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work events from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the treaty .
&quot; in July , assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , leading to the fact that the Treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official re @-@ negotiations with all your worries . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has today set a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work trials which begins in early September . &quot;
&quot; the li@@ tig@@ ations led to the fact that assistance doctors , this year , strike six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the B@@ MA assistant physicians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana , came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up their hands and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was bri@@ ghtly , and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even be improved . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper describing Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if anything bad had happened . &quot;
&quot; for me , his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness revealed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia .
&quot; the crime was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot;
re@@ building the confidence becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at once it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to make a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan , first and foremost , needs all the friends he can get after he has been dism@@ issed by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat in almost his office last month . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ long ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television estimated cheaper fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish farm imports are permitted . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there lang , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West since its reaction to the attempted sei@@ z@@ ure of power is regarded as a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ elling of the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ ped to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
the Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
&quot; for Moscow , this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to port@@ ray a &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me : two countries , who viol@@ ate themselves from the West and are badly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposite sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents have said at the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ ped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders will at least talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the bank manager of the bank the brand R@@ BS should be only reduced to a back office role .
Scotland &apos;s Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be saved and saved almost collap@@ sed eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all the RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange are to be changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for retail customers that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer carry out its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we had said that we would be a great bank for our clients and have launched these stamps .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has reached the release of € 4@@ 000@@ th at the release of ... New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; the rul@@ ction , which was trained by John GO@@ die , reached a milestone on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second prize of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I ended up here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20.000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
... D@@ ett@@ ori picked up the che@@ ers when he got a victory on the ...
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ year winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career plans &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that only few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect which distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already scored 6000 gains if he was not just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden nearly 30 years in the UK , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat racing for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve w@@ reck@@ ing .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulty in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his top shape . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least fifty years .
Russia &apos;s Putin mo@@ ist Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ issed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est confidence circle for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed the Special Represent@@ ative for Environment and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been his deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later became Secretary of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot;
&quot; on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and controls in order to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin , and works as he works for the Soviet Secret Service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff repe@@ ats his own wish . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at present .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed for great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks addressed to Putin , which are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaints for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , conf@@ using ally Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after beating producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement his dism@@ iss@@ al .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ olog@@ ised publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his termination . &quot;

puzzles to fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
&quot; a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot;
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it might be a sand@@ al for the 75 fish that have been mir@@ r@@ ored by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inch fishes . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closing statements of the &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; that will approach completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 lashes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; economic Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site today , and was one of the first to travel from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering craft of a truly epic dimension in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a sensitive activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , nearly 79 % of the total deck @-@ deck @-@ deck @-@ deck chairs are in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck now in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project is the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting high@@ - and low @-@ construction .
&quot; after the installation of the last road covering and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ top located in the extension , we had to close the gap between the north or the south side . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern loading bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances , on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
saving in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
&quot; three men are lucky to be alive , after they were tos@@ sed by their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm on Friday after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and placed the worst off , &quot; said the head of the Lif@@ ebo@@ at by Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already seen the boat out of their reach until we left the water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fisher@@ man boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boom without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this was loos@@ ened from the person who was steering the boat . &quot;

seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cut out the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and on the body .
the police arrested the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
she then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companions .
on the road they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ life companion .
&quot; when the two wives entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens believe that investors are expected to be much stronger in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig is lost almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; for the next council meeting . &quot;
but conflict is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future , has to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann says , &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is to provide incentives . &quot;
the problem is that Brat@@ mann says : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fr@@ actions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
&quot; no matter what , so Brat@@ man , a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action concept is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; however , the programme is not entirely new : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how can one compare the loss of additional around 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of being able to get apartments back into the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the west @-@ city they run for the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments could be found there back into the price range for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West city again dras@@ tically increases , they are removed from the aim of so @-@ called confusion . &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; said vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that there is not yet a compromise to be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go to hunt for health and happiness
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside , but prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been su@@ ed by many over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games , and finally on smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
&quot; I am of course referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena in pop culture fell in interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in the beginning of July something . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers were over@@ loaded .
&quot; within days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der , and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were found &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game resulted in a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ fut@@ ed each day . &quot;
&quot; car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people , who train every day 30 minutes , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take 30 minutes to &quot; come from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , &quot; launched on de@@ af ears because many public messages are d@@ ull to health and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonder of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun to them .
&quot; three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt for new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always , there are also worms that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it ?
it has made a breakthrough .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and its use will fade with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic winner .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for a multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team champion A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the individual multi @-@ campaign of women in gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual woman winning a multi @-@ battle title and the fifth , while strengthening its reputation , to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as the unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated their sport in the last three years , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises winning a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic winner of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the ath@@ lets , but rather between it and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be seen as dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after having won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ al fet@@ ched the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true . &quot;
a part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos;s mother during a school failure in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as Bil@@ es desires . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ afa was easily led by two turns , the picture ble@@ w . &quot;
floating beams and floor ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lies .
&quot; she again took 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and , with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground , she got another one . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced her sof@@ tly when she expected her clos@@ eness - a pure form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed on Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Must@@ afa was going . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her floor exercises she threw the audience into K@@ us@@ sh@@ agen , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;

police : 3 victims shot in the car when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer fall of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ gun while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police said that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y , because the att@@ acker did not take hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led by the investig@@ ators to take a closer look on whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; all in all , seven people were killed and two were injured in nine attacks during four months in nine attacks . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which took half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridges and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , playing toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his predec@@ essors , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t manage it . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I was not allowed to do that .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , you have embark@@ ed on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
Vincent and her husband have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund designed for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him character language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .

&quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency shelter on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Mississi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded its shores and threatened with large floo@@ ds after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the communities involved .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood early warning system was deployed on Friday while it was still raining in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels throughout the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers flow slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten rivers . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still dra@@ fted people out of the flood water in the am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the Sou@@ thwest of Mississi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that waters of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , climbed over night . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step @-@ son , who lives nearby , would have warned him . &quot;
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water poured into it , &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a high tide of the river in the 48 years where she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a big military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the &quot; &quot; floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been significantly weigh@@ ed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching crew in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an R@@ ank@@ ed in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the leader of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals , which were flus@@ hed by the floo@@ ds . &quot;
emergency shel@@ ters were set up in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will go back to their houses , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Mississi@@ ppi , the Emergency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ down said that it was still raining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday were not reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; Ac@@ qu@@ ated by B@@ alls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police told that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot wounds , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was hospit@@ alized during his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was broken by bul@@ lets , &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z told the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that it is expected to recover again .
he would have initiated the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just identified whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia claiming that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge tubes for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , sur@@ passed the scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the path , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and the police are currently checking the surveillance video , according to reports . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ r@@ ack@@ et when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police is still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , which is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ ast female was A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
&quot; last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 . &quot;
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic winner and America was che@@ ering . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ times world champ@@ ions of Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gy@@ ms all over the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all struck the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to make it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymn@@ asts . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are a cost@@ lier sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily held in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents responsible for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these associations , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started exercising . &quot;
&quot; we must au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , provide an affordable and easy accessible exercise . &quot;
I have established my Turn@@ stiftung for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ans ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and train national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer young high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits to health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the holding of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant physicians would like to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assistants who voted for election refused . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans revealed to introduce the treaty for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistants are to receive a new contract , which includes changes on night and weekend work to improve care at times of times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , president of the B@@ MA committee for assistance doctors announced last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance specialists appointed to the proposed treaty as before serious concerns , in particular that it will address the current shortage crisis and address all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts by B@@ MA to resolve disputes by discussions pushed to participate in the government on account of reluc@@ tance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistance specialists . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the assistants have made clear that they are ready to carry out further work trials . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were involved to provide doctors on the strike street cover . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the Reform Treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA would like to receive a better week pay for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors , who will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Staff , urged the assistants to quit the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work fights do not achieve anything of the only little , but bur@@ dened already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , foster and their families only worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of assistants and responded positively to concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication which can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication after recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended for a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended for a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
&quot; when the flooring inter@@ rup@@ ts , it can cause a blood cl@@ utter that c@@ log blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots are dissolved , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ b@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health technology assessment center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes electoral fraud thri@@ ve in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities are know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , former cabinet member , att@@ aches verb@@ ally to the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ offen@@ ders to ignore proof of election abuse on account of &quot; over@@ sensitivity in eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an interim leader , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elec@@ tive cab@@ s to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should take a card to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must merely name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , when they vote on their voting voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he ur@@ ges that the press should have more access to municipal documentation and decisions of non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Ele@@ ction Committee in the East of London .
&quot; last year , a Special Court decided that the current mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation when one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of ways to prove identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report , it is stated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there have been concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ cs and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists are editing letter templates to stop &quot; re@@ election . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing after your identification .
&quot; do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger , as soon as she has handed her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic let@@ tering .
ban that political activists are editing full let@@ ter@@ ings and envel@@ opes from let@@ ter@@ ings .
the police have the authority to set off barriers to recru@@ it elec@@ tive stations .
&quot; a change of law , which facilitates an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ation Act 1983 ) . &quot;
ban on photograp@@ hing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of training to ensure that employees en@@ force the rule that voters alone go to the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it ast@@ o@@ unding that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ Control &quot; of the constitu@@ ent regi@@ sters of the Town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spreading of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic sport@@ s@@ men in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come across the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , out of edge and band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ female in the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by far not the only one to compete for gold ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if one may believe in the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides Kate Doppel@@ gänger on the track , many people on the internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin @-@ celeb@@ r@@ ity of A @-@ Pro@@ mi could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star sc@@ ary .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher received the mad@@ ness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see big simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking fellow , so I think it is a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big , expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double @-@ eph@@ emer@@ al for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh have been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a hall@@ way higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption acting actor .
&quot; another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ ons in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about others the simil@@ arities were also noticed
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the gymn@@ ast Gab@@ by Douglas , which resembles her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese float in &quot; like a pig die &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds &apos;s analysis of the 4th place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at dr 4x@@ 200m open @-@ style swi@@ ms ou@@ sted viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
Canadian Sender C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float in &quot; like &quot; went down &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was turned off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor swimming pool .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; color , &quot; one could say : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the union , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as M@@ ief , he died as a pig . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; the Chinese float Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the s@@ wimming@@ pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible to open the gap to China . &quot;
viewers throughout Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and speech
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ et , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ in from China &quot; died like a pig ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China has been described in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m Fre@@ estyle Te@@ al for women as follows : &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard with which many were talking to him
Twitter users did not return when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ek@@ ed .
&quot; shortly after Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ se on Twitter
the comment@@ ator collector Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users , compl@@ aining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments . &quot;
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the show and our fo@@ als in the social media yesterday night .
&quot; in order to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments relate to the performance of float in and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympic show , he said . &quot;
&quot; I looked at the performance of float in and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about woman who ta@@ sted in the middle of the shop sham@@ eless under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman moved out her clothes in the midst of a prim@@ rose in order to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she must@@ ered , as she looked , drew her out , and laid her back to the shelf . &quot;
they continued to rum@@ ble and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark Shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ garments , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of pants from the out@@ lay , pulled her own trun@@ ks and trousers and ta@@ sted her . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that her nothing fell and went out and kick@@ ed out .
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone observing - or thinking about the person who could buy the under@@ pants which she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; How embarrass@@ ing to think that someone would take home pants with home that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I received , the employees tried to draw the garments from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had dressed her and pulled out again and they were not washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , August 9 , at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been sold out of the sale .
how to protect yourself against arms attacks by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to rotate the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , you should first turn around so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free Ell@@ bows .
&quot; beat him with his knees in the bar and twi@@ sted , while the att@@ acker cr@@ ushes against pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards as they turn the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and turn the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s done Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
remember that it is saf@@ est to pass your money if you don &apos;t have a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t his tongue for a guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and thro@@ ws of serious testing by checking out some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ orted his course on a Euro ticket , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing head of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before le@@ aking each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he will get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment made under the title &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to the daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of le@@ aking the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a pulling toil@@ ette that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he le@@ qu@@ ed , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
&quot; from public hand@@ rails at train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task ceased to put his immune system under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about what concerns my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was justified in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its proof@@ ing showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to that , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ re number is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to le@@ ak after their L@@ umin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; It &apos;s close to the worst that I got in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
&quot; I will not dock here , because it is disgu@@ sting here in@@ doors . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company has vali@@ dated Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of gut bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we conducted mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended that we said &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film director , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he checked out some of the things I have instruc@@ ted him , like the hec@@ tic Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to stop them and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
glad we recorded some of these dirty tricks on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents registered l@@ actic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of g@@ astro@@ intestinal and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before Del@@ og@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family abandoned her social housing after a de@@ duction of £ 50,000 , because she terr@@ orized her neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; once they were viol@@ ently removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; walls showed clearing holes , wooden floor@@ boards were torn up , garbage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think that people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is as well .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the property , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up &quot;
neighbours say they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police to be inv@@ oked .
Corn@@ wall Housing made her and her partner viol@@ ently by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
&quot; the dol@@ lies were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours , who said their life was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They shot at no one . &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always terrible .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it would have failed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the church building , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant pre@@ tended to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the final step taken into consideration by Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and had to be terrible at all for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have bol@@ dly approached us and gave us the information we have provided . &quot;
I hope that this development will give con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and convey@@ s the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but they were all over 20 . &quot;

workers of the property management now have to dream garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ by was given a fine , after having found guilty of the owner of a drug of class B in commercial property . &quot;
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son , Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 during a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
police say that they will run ten@@ ants who do not stick to house rules
Angela C@@ row told the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall stating that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who were har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists traveling in Portugal in panic after over@@ flying a military jet beach
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Lou@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces deployed an incredible assault flight
&quot; the air forces announced that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk &quot;
this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ dy jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military plane flew close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came through the clouds to them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep two times and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ ya added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro have been caught in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew extremely deep .
&quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force forces announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to identify them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that due to the bad visibility of the area , the jet flew somewhat deeper than usual , but the air forces persist@@ ently waited for the safety at no time endangered . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people from Madeira to death . &quot;
&quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force forces announced that the pilot had to fly as deeply due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the team &apos;s fitness condition , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
even at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .

Donald Tr@@ ump publishes ″ rough problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states , to lose their majority . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump presidential candidate now has weaknesses of his election campaign in the former repub@@ lican Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within his own repub@@ lican camp , the doubts about his success are growing in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; if false reports on his candid@@ acy were bl@@ amed , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known meditation . &quot;
&quot; repub@@ lican &quot; &quot; stron@@ gh@@ olds &quot; &quot; sh@@ aking &quot;
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see dump in the front , but not by the distance that is custom@@ ary for repub@@ lican candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump answers the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and h@@ ello : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing other than telling the truth .
&quot; if it &apos;s not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Party should have threatened to withdraw funds to support his election campaign , he should not present better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans voted for Congress more under the arms . &quot;

the IO@@ C aims to set up a discipline of discipline .
Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro undo .
&quot; following a coll@@ usion attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately announced a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan officials informed that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , passed a trial in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the team leadership Ken@@ ias from the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case , to make its own investigations , and shared an IA@@ AF spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; says it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , the rehear@@ sal submitted and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ ias Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing in 2015 about 800 meters .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics @-@ Deleg@@ ation@@ sh@@ ef Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is alleged to have informed athletes of his country on pending d@@ oping tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return to the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya is already under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing @-@ off@@ s .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was un@@ common that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; in consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control conform to the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; at last , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
in this sport it could be proven that in this kind of sport it was under@@ stated systematically and systematically .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the &quot; &quot; Shakespeare @-@ Jahr &quot; &quot; the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical to the classical temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth space with the role of Mary . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Christian . &quot;
she is remember@@ ing her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for opera singers : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American Director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ a went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want to . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they did then . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Bul@@ war@@ k of the Group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had anticipated to leave the war @-@ torn country and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school girls from East London embark@@ ed on a plane to Turkey and then take a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and became a wi@@ dow in less months . &quot;
&quot; Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of an election victory at Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court , &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the dec@@ eased judge of the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for Rei@@ d said later that he would not have talked with Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hero@@ in of the Repub@@ lican candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants to make naked calendar for &quot; women and men &quot;
&quot; the Tre@@ ats Magazine co @-@ operates with the photographer David Belle@@ mere , to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year , that his nude magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , it is the view that the calendar also does . &quot;
&quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the release of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally with open Cast@@ ing Appe@@ al in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community counts with mass ex@@ odus
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ affiliated Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of refugees trying to flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the chairman of the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh disaster of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already covered Kur@@ dish high @-@ bur@@ sts with sanctions , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the mis@@ erable put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional Eth@@ nic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the director compl@@ ained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; with this , Erdo@@ gan is aiming to increase the pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the director requested that the Federal Government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters .
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is held against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ is , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the paper reported on alleg@@ ations of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks already set the largest group of asylum rights recognized in Germany because of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; on the date of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all citizens named asylum seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no escape from war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;

strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign - and holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the land day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the election of the country will not again be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; as far as so far , it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land mass struggle - that bit@@ es itself . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the elec@@ tors , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see on the way , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the land day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , circul@@ ate fl@@ yers and count out voices , only lab@@ ori@@ ously apply . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is forced to pass an election campaign barely on the people past . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , when you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : premi@@ er Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , which has been the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ ers Af@@ D cut off and what remains at the end of coalition fit .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ u@@ ously active election campaign , one sees from its large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , ro@@ ses ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , marin@@ ering has got cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel bl@@ ames the bl@@ oss@@ oms of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create that &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with their candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to commemor@@ ations ; Merkel &apos;s President of the Bundestag is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual campaign levels on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that means co@@ king , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that on the country , its base is crum@@ bling , that it must be very strict , to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ se of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U candidate Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ deb@@ unk@@ ed : &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the S &amp; D Group last stood at 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD was still able to win even 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the parliament . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and share their campaign of great advantage on the internet .
&quot; online campaign , &quot; it calls the chairman Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , green election set@@ ups go on track search for local voice @-@ makers among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , kur@@ v@@ t straight with a hou@@ seb@@ o@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which starts at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only ends at 8 pm , there is always praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything pretty cr@@ un@@ chy , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; at the beginning of the week , the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at half @-@ time , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the obj@@ ec@@ ti@@ fication of those responsible for construction work is also v@@ owed , such as when it comes to the establishment of mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft drives . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was immig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 back on both sides .
the road traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the deputy director Florian King responsible for the management of the remedi@@ ation management . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ strasse , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping channels were searching and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ k .
&quot; as the speed limits were not met , the municipality increasingly called for the trade fair from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation on the spot . &quot;
two to three per minute have been blind@@ ed .
the fastest was on the way with 77 km / h kilometres in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; however , that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to revenue losses , everyone who is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also adm@@ its that &quot; the running search is missing . &quot; &quot;
the most heavily hit are the locals along the street .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; road renovation has dropped its operation &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ issed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , if there is a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER white from other districts , where something more generous was handled . &quot;
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars look less frequently because of the complicated traffic @-@ route , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t go down , it is also elsewhere nice . &quot;
&quot; that its root @-@ kli@@ sts come back after the end of the refurb@@ ishment work , there is no doubt that G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is brut@@ ally brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of counter @-@ terrorism , it is constantly being scre@@ ened to laws . &quot;
&quot; following the recent proposals , Minister of the Interior , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , now presents a th@@ icker security package . &quot;
but what has a divor@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the idea of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
other further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 1 ) 1,@@ 50@@ 6 194 Tauch@@ schein ? &quot;
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gave a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for the security in the Republic . &quot;
but this is all the more extensive .
&quot; some things are already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cr@@ acking of co@@ ded communication is not new . &quot;
not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt on proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; ro@@ unding the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he does not consider this to be reasonable and also demands nothing , which in the case of coalition partners has no chances . &quot;
Mai@@ zi@@ ère also presents some new ideas .
they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities for detention of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted to the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in case of bul@@ let@@ ins for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to pose some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately disc@@ ard their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of these are political and legal hei@@ rs .
some also work un@@ compens@@ ated and leaves questions un@@ answered .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient , for example - is the question : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be argued that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in view of the high refugee figures , many people were worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that deeply hurt people , were not allowed to complain at times of election . &quot;
the internal security is enorm@@ ously put into focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; yes , there are election fights . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly turning into position . &quot;
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ chy dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a return of the double pass , he does not hold anything . &quot;
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
to make a new one is not sensible .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things to fight for stri@@ fe .
&quot; however , even the SPD is currently attempting to profit from internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ sal@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel once carefully signals the willingness to talk and says , &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still g@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing through .
&quot; in spite of diesel engines , ex@@ tradition numbers are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
&quot; in the event of recall , ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e is about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries restra@@ ined in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; despite the diesel engine , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can further demonstrate a plus in spite of diesel engines , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; however , in July , the core brand came weaker mainly in Western Europe and thus charged the total sales , as the company noted in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost a six@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; sales of brand sales , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weaker figures from July above all to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets by &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation relating to the put@@ sch@@ ism in Turkey , the British vote weigh@@ ed on the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes were first cold , there is also a minus in be@@ ech . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler increased sales plans . &quot;
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles sold Volkswagen at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is launching some 2.5 million cars for conversion into workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the conversion , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars had no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after conversion of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after the retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer ref@@ uses a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason is j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal fin@@ eness .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models .
this would have confirmed VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was a meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after retro@@ fitting , no deterior@@ ations will occur and all type approval relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was meant in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after the conversion , customers come into a workshop with a motor damage - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that for any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas sc@@ andal , there is uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day @-@ to @-@ day cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German banks &apos; Bundes@@ verband speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : normal raf@@ ters must &quot; &quot; not fear &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; banks spend money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ ni@@ es . &quot;
&quot; this fee is required by the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on checking or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the future , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; he has been holding 40 million Euros for some time , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the costs are now passed on . &quot;
&quot; easy to leave the cash in the Raiff@@ eisen Bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t even have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to bear alone , be &quot; business @-@ economic not possible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian Volks@@ bank and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their skat@@ eboard stores in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Head of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay full @-@ coverage for deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele which is a bit more luxuri@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if it ski@@ pped free of charge . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no further banks are known to the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria , which calcul@@ ates a substitute for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the neg@@ atives towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
destination Pl@@ ates : who bu@@ ys gram@@ ophone records ?
lonely men middle aged men love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section , to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ gri@@ m Men &apos;s middle age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much @-@ up resur@@ gence of gram@@ ophone records is not due to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers prefer their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wil@@ dly stu@@ ffy before I stay , hold my hands and determine something like : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o sits slowly in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there still remains a handful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , by S@@ ister Ray ( number of numbers : two young women , three men middle aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford to buy , when he was young and ple@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70@@ ies , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are promp@@ ted to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people tend to get rid of their collection since 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs now to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom in followers of the record label of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record shops offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers kick@@ ed off the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , of objects that wake up happy che@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or poss@@ essions of material poss@@ essions than a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee in@@ still@@ s from a pile of records . &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I am wondering through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of numbers : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more product , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who come first slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience than I enter . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and women middle aged . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s newest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ tet Pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ming from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks odd , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand alongside someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she rather makes a window @-@ shopping as a wholesale purchase .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t earn much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a loving si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record holders : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; as I admit to patterns the jeans ties , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id Cam@@ eras , before a father and his daughter think about buying a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one who has the most for lux@@ uries like panels . &quot;
&quot; even though my investigations yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collector &apos;s and plate lovers who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .

French court rejected supply of refugee camps in the refugee camps jungle
&quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; at a trial trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops , in which individuals sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be dem@@ ol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and that would be a fire and san@@ itation risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups judged the Court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also noted that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ ice was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp serving as charity and offering 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot;

&quot; for example , they can give up to players missions and deplo@@ y enemies as well as provide equipment . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er has to adapt to the next generation speed gauge : in different federal states , including in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash units will be tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic @-@ looking en@@ forcement trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary speed poles , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ unt for the observ@@ ance of speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction may be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the rein@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in case of un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as entry b@@ ans according to time , driver strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , it is possible to move the trailer by car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply cl@@ apped , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also fail @-@ safe outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the he@@ aters from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different German states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also have a new technique : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
United Kingdom wins silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold wins
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ 7 Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in the handling , side st@@ eppe , back@@ rest , line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji could have hit a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on will hang a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under Ryan . &quot;
here they only lose one .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and dism@@ issed the attacks of GB@@ s .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell to and Co. to run into driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 up , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au rus@@ hed across the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he changed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; a domin@@ ating T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute ath@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right hand a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the revival and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed to the line to make a gate .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB was still there . &quot;
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes which was good for the rati@@ os of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova passed through a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had been running for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ ems , whose fans sang , wave flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced themselves and GB kick@@ ed out in the grass . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; in the first half of K@@ yle Brown , K@@ yle Brown broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the coach &apos;s cancer to achieve rowing victory
there will be no remote gold than with these games and that wants something .
&quot; from the first rowing stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter the story , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 39.@@ 3 un@@ de@@ pressed application , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes who slide over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was nobody more helpful than the trainer , who wouldn &apos;t survive 30 months ago , when diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , in case that in such circumstances is the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
that &apos;s how it starts .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts came to Williams , who spent an annoying morning talking about anything else than usual , trying to handle his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was the cent@@ ur@@ ion of the Royal Arti@@ llery reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him goes . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began closing , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let oneself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking forward to doing something oll@@ es .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
the association is considered &quot; Bavaria far exemplary . &quot;
a small Francon@@ ian drinking water supply association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was in the original on a contribution from the Bavarian Radio .
little later the water forum of the Government of Lower Francon@@ ia announced the purpose of the purpose .
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group suffered &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , was 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water supply association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the municipalities Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other towns and communities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed General Manager of the Board of Directors in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they were aston@@ ished by the construction and maintenance work of office and organisation activities , the bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high capacity container ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the pri@@ ming up of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always added improvements because water is the most important food and drinking water . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and proper service for over 31 years . &quot;
he has used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and has regularly used the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he worked as a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Lower Francon@@ ia Water@@ forum . &quot;
for this he received very much recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller in his turn praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water keeper and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as high points from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and re @-@ structuring of the association &apos;s association . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the break @-@ down at the high container at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the towns could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brunn had to be maintained once , because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
&quot; soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago , and addresses other parents concerned : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot down on his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 .
&quot; the man called us and stated to have shot his life @-@ mate , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly tra@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; now nationwide , because Sven S. might be travelling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.80 meters large , muscular , brown burned and has a glass . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 . &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lübeck wanted no information about the transfer or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but it confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at the moment , &quot; said a police spokes@@ man in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special service mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - Light view for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the branch out of the eco @-@ electricity promotion are of the table .
&quot; in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Tran@@ sition in the German steel industry , Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) spoke of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach tough negotiations .
&quot; at first , the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when generators are replaced in the steel works , an E@@ EG lev@@ y is 20 percent . &quot;
but also this is not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for the production of own power .
&quot; in this way , the status quo is largely written to the previous regulation . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; said IG Metall chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel branch in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation escal@@ ated further than the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers throw price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
&quot; on the one hand , import duties have been shown on import @-@ steel effects , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have intensi@@ fied . &quot;
unclear is how sustain@@ ably the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp wanted to conclude at last also closure of individual works .
&quot; around 12@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry by the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced nearly six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the German economic association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the amount produced now went back for the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s studies she occupied the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of the music , describes Ho@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often , social and family structures are often dis@@ connected , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to be able to speak and organise themselves to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
those who regularly request their lungs get out of the pu@@ ste in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generation , joint singing had a much higher priority ; it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or hearing songs in elderly people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , people critically reflect on long rec@@ umbent events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head will also require a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concentrating on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just older people who live alone are doing so , not just concentrating on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in a choir .

cats react sensi@@ tively as tom@@ cats on cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect is the calling of cat @-@ cats on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , mi@@ str@@ ust caused the males not cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of cat @-@ bears on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great need , as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) have found out . &quot;
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ates of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the team of researchers has already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult male and eight female que@@ ens were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were played for a cri@@ b of babies who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally raised . &quot;
the researchers keep their findings in spite of the low sample of meaningful information .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had their own offspring , responded differently to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they swi@@ f@@ tly turned to the loudspeaker when this calls of the very cold k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; one surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby noise . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ er@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski grab@@ s with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the Erz@@ ri@@ val between Bes@@ ik@@ tas , Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be affected by the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , there is no need for football in front of football . &quot;
&quot; against the former St@@ ark@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ kü@@ r is to be supporters of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; although the state of emergency last for 90 days is still valid until October , it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan at the end of Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the employers &apos; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in view of dramatic experiences in history , the harsh rejection of military put@@ ts is what the ke@@ el of the Turks interven@@ es in the face of dramatic experiences . &quot;
even the fans even agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; prize winner , Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will be arriving . &quot;
&quot; with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top@@ sc@@ orer of his club . &quot;
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his crew .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to gain something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the season was better . &quot;
&quot; above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ré@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig put the base on the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in the case of the AC Florence under contract , the Gom@@ ez just borrow@@ ed after the attempted coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European vac@@ ations did not return . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club manager F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man quoted . &quot;
&quot; in order to do so , the stri@@ ker should be willing to abst@@ ain from around a third of its annual shareholder value of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man realized : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing , these athletes still have medals chance at Olympia in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova cannot start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the question of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian float Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had su@@ ed her start right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was stream@@ lined and boo@@ sted at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
it was a bizarre setting : with a smile she was still tr@@ apped in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
&quot; when it was fixed that they were not going to get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more sport@@ s@@ men who , despite dop@@ ing past , go to the start of the Rio Olympics in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion runs even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic winner and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after taking the anal@@ ges@@ ic by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the 2012 Olympic Champion of 2012 and European Champion of 2013 and European Championships have been tested positively on the banned tun@@ ic meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic testi@@ fied that he was in@@ gest@@ ed and locked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positively in 2010 and was banned for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , subject to mer@@ ging . &quot;

&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ head , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete was able to diagnose as many medals at a later time . &quot;
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after having been diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release the 2004 Olympic silver due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
&quot; in 2008 , he was awarded a bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a judgment of the CAS International Sports Court . &quot;
&quot; at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the World Ranking List . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record collector and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may nevertheless start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old world champion , indications of taking a banned dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA broke out and ran already on July 13th . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered from cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her home voyage for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ antel@@ on are also Austrian citizens , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , so liqu@@ or . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai people were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and according to the authorities another human being was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach , popular beach beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flo@@ wer@@ room in front of the territory of the coast police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ antel@@ on on the south @-@ east coast called several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; &quot; said Army ener@@ al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ yl@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express itself to possible motives , but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks , typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have received confidential information on im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
still unclear which group falls behind the attacks .
&quot; the police declared their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings , airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but mostly they do not address tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) landed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) suffered for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military jun@@ ta .
this also gives the military considerable influence over the years to come .
&quot; jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , with@@ drew itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost a year ago , there were 20 people killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; has come into sight of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; after several national offices , the constitutional guards at the federal government have also set up the Group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; identical movement &apos; cl@@ ues for efforts against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; said Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ essen of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants in Islamic faith or from the Middle East become de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we now watch the movement .
the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; it is directed against &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional guards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identical . &quot; &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Inves@@ tig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to address them with a young @-@ just language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
that is not a fu@@ tile advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to attract people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports of contacts from the &quot; &quot; identified &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not know . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not evident .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal convic@@ tions and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ e said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler group .
&quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ e expressed concern that many attacks came to the account of people who previously did not appear in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games and World Records are not always determining the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courage@@ ous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics centre , the slightly over@@ weight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia is so slow that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures at times . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
&quot; because in Ethiopia most athletes run , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first names quickly made the round .
some media described him as &quot; ro@@ uble of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ ids &quot; The Sun &quot; made fun of him with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds on the 100 meters open @-@ style , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i caused media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

he then drive on holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV channel CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he signed the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;

&quot; Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long term , a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into gri@@ t in tr@@ ench : eight wounded
&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ umm@@ ho@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered heavy injuries , distributed the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her information to an accommod@@ ating vice , partly on the counter @-@ railway . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ person for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; because of the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency doctor came to the accident site on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured trav@@ eller was brought back by a bus back to the P@@ ew@@ sum Kr@@ umm@@ ho@@ ern part of the city .
&quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company . &quot;
investig@@ ators called for the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter of waste water from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ vom@@ iting 3,@@ 44 instead of now 2.10 € ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget by the Federal Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , Kul@@ mb@@ ach stated that under@@ cover for these wast@@ ewater treatment plants . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from the world , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as the Board of Management , Herbert Schmidt showed to the body , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period .
&quot; Schmidt founded the grave increases in all three wast@@ ewater treatment plants with relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ewater treatment , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the low distribution criteria , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the volume of wast@@ ewater in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , all three systems were in a considerable size not least due to their age restructuring and repair expenses . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for cat@@ fish , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp nearly 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf wast@@ ewater treatment plant .
&quot; at the Wel@@ sch@@ ahl pump@@ ing station , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up . after nearly 20 years of operation the first clari@@ fication pond had to be repaired , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility had to be installed in order to withstand the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that at the low wast@@ ewater treatment in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are fully per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt continued to spare the market community of major entertainment costs at the wast@@ ewater facilities over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the aforementioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious according to stone houses in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ ewater treatment association can not be extended because these facilities are non @-@ existent . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as positive 0.2 % were booked .
the annual average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in July 2016 : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that ad@@ joins the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can transform into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are bl@@ ended , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mal@@ ign@@ ments arrive at the public .
snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app of Black@@ face beneficial or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sl@@ ot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and dark@@ er che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; aun@@ ted face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and the indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat informed that it turned off the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others refused the anim@@ e comparison deci@@ de@@ dly .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et has been widely spread over the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; vulnerable and &quot; &quot; canc@@ eled was unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not secured , but that the yellow face has been pulled down to the extreme extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of integrity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ chat &apos;s big audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ ed in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ chat filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and others decided to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently focused on personnel managers , focusing on sub@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; on their part , Z@@ hu said they will have closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
military se@@ duc@@ ing IS@@ IS Intelligence Service Provi@@ des Committee of Con@@ gres@@ sion@@ al
&quot; military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw up an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual conditions were allowed on site , reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican members of the Military Revolutionary Committee , secret service committees and the military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , just Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence official information , typically sent off by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly reported a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated . &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their laws , to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command Press Releases , statements and statements made before the congress were significantly more positive than the facts , &quot; the report highlighted . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com affiliated publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while continuing the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee announced their own findings that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com established an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the supreme Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave moder@@ ately little space to diver@@ gent opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no cl@@ ues to a White House intervention at Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts in terms of a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who were taken up after complaints by Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts . &quot;
&quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , there was a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for the ehr@@ an in@@ estim@@ ation of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of divisions of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a piece of writing about how the former government under George W. Bush obj@@ ected only a small cre@@ eping force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led Mr. Hoo@@ ker to provide government officials that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State could have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these tent@@ ative refin@@ eries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ ala commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive app@@ rais@@ al of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the US wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain &quot;
&quot; one day after hitting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American army team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
&quot; however , she knows : the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ains in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first @-@ placed player will take a little longer from the path leading the other group .
&quot; as always the game may run on Saturday , the Americans have spark@@ ed a surprising vort@@ ex with their success story four years after they landed on the last of 12 places at the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et in her hands ( her two older sisters playing the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ space in London we have now .
we can s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gat@@ e@@ aux in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close @-@ up area .
&quot; India had gone into play without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball across the left flan@@ k , then pulled into the middle and loaded the ball into the door to get the American female 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable , a fur@@ ious eas@@ el between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod that is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s warm with dimples , could well have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if it were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the Olympic trampoline jumping around gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade , are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognized : air@@ guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I &apos;m modest to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was perceived the last 16 years so spar@@ se that many that I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic port@@ art at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 had made an ath@@ lete who made it up to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans who are for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never to end ben@@ evol@@ ent pr@@ el@@ ude , but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ asi@@ um and diving , the two types of sports that it essentially un@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; jumping @-@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling movements ( turning , bit@@ ing and sal@@ ts ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are rated according to official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram after execution , level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ time athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts have to go to gold in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and back , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they ch@@ ase not only the finish line or the bas@@ eline , but also another highlight in the TV transmission : that of the world or the Olympic ord . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator into tears . &quot;
but it is also what I find myself when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition too , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity . &quot;
it &apos;s such a Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be .
&quot; the qualification and final hours of women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time , which the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2@@ pm .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear @-@ monkeys and the objective male athletes - as the male US turbines recently proposed , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan community according to the air . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ esting &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , ally an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s non @-@ violent resistance .
witnesses say that seventy prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia just to collapse ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the past few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and wi@@ dened in more and more territories .
&quot; last week , thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
the government &apos;s response was mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses testi@@ fied that polic@@ emen injured on seventy un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators killed and killed .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security workers strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights now demands an incoming enquiry .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dras@@ tically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , with dissi@@ dents being sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ eh@@ old in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a vast choice last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea , a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years were more or less forced to exploit tur@@ mo@@ il and to arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of de@@ bit@@ ing under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first seems harmless : smart phones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate via social media since cheaper smartphone became more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government closes the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still talk about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians claimed that they were so protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ cosmos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which are predominantly Christian high @-@ nation@@ als from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this too changes .
&quot; we are to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos areas .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ edly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , in secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , until his death on a not publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 was 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to deal with opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ scrut@@ able reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested against elections that were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and then stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters held in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ ic city , of Tig@@ ray held businesses and hatred against the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama has established IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking his repeatedly repeated statement , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would not have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Repub@@ lican candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intel@@ li@@ gible with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings out his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful period in protection , to explain in the peculiar position , asser@@ tions that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made an event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump insi@@ sted on the statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposition to the previous day , in which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican candidate did not want to know anything about it . &quot;
the last storm of cri@@ tique will boun@@ ce down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposal would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July , he critici@@ zed a strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert observing the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his asser@@ tions v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more cor@@ ro@@ sive tone since its survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps fired his loyal co @-@ workers into the un@@ convenient situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent interc@@ essors , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani , therefore , asked Mr. Giuli@@ ani to be mistaken if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it h@@ ind legs , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an out@@ sider , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out aggres@@ sively in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of ro@@ aming about each of his words and against him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cks the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos; ap@@ ology as only proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
&quot; b@@ ump@@ ed once over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ab@@ by café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which was no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices went out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shopping front . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie store , which was replaced in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people registered it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel excluding and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is change , then it &apos;s also a re @-@ discovery . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new outside place , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , consul@@ ted a lot . &quot;
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so pocket model .
it even uses the same lamps out of the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ces onions .
there are path@@ ways of nature .
&quot; the café does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed aside by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
Oli@@ v@@ eira ( 34 ) lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb closed , she gave up the coffee table for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal was another long @-@ standing and faithful customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing b@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing b@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no gru@@ dge on the fact that the soap shop has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to make a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on the offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he plans to exhibit it soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a charter customer and said he was destroyed in the ground , when the café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to craw@@ l , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and both food histori@@ cs .
&quot; CO@@ A last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; talked about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ri@@ fied snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash 1929 . &quot;
&quot; 54 , ordered a fresh water sandwich with olive @-@ pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ y meat , this was the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap food that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have put itself in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ as for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; traces the ways in which the country turned out to be no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious foods like lo@@ aves and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , which recy@@ cle the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ generating food resi@@ dues , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange compounds have been tried , because a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had prim@@ acy to taste or even healthy dishes . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes prescri@@ ptions , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not suitable for each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country such . &quot;
&quot; by publishing prescri@@ ptions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and to meet the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies .
&quot; particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , he feeds like the milli@@ on@@ th man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and provided a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully strange .
&quot; President Roosev@@ elt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ h an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the hired @-@ day of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law better understood when writing the book , for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of w@@ asting food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; and Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the drop in the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um @-@ dessert , the President Roosev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a usual trick to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ ved something reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a post .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do bud@@ dy , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar donated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a lap@@ el attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life in the game , to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilians protecting him at a 11 hour rescue of inf@@ ants from the rub@@ ble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but as a hero , he has never seen himself , said lou@@ dly : &quot; &quot; for me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrels of bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adia district and one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing difficulty . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; quotes the picture of his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually occurs only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination aboard the S@@ anna research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland is only 150 years old .
&quot; the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it is just 1.@@ 220 metres wide on average . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
this lifestyle em@@ bos@@ sed by slow@@ ness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock , this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed long that Greenland &apos;s Stone Age would become a stone age . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin@@ ly settled coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know correspon@@ d@@ ingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
&quot; their slow @-@ pent@@ ag@@ ony sense them , when they presented six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; this sh@@ arks still make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seals , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for car@@ c@@ ass looking down from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 502 centimet@@ ers measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucleus of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins that it contains will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
&quot; after the early 1960s , their birth was to lie in the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon search for large quantities of this radio@@ active carbon . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with 220 centimet@@ ers length of the third @-@ smallest animal , the lens , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their len@@ tic@@ ular nucleus , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers would be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign an age to their length . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this should also be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not acci@@ dental .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon of har@@ poon , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals often also runs on fl@@ ames . &quot;
&quot; so , they mature later - and age more slowly . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal feeds heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as many offspring as possible early as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
a very large animal should instead invest its resources into a long life .
building plot in a dou@@ ble@@ pack
&quot; with themes revol@@ ving around construction , the municipal council has dealt with the focus of the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel adopted by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the commerci@@ alization of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the land , par@@ amount and development questions were clari@@ fied and the requests for survey@@ ing could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ ber@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - Recon@@ struction section 1 ) is nothing in the way of interested parties . &quot;
&quot; the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and calm residential community Schön@@ au , young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors can address equally . &quot;
&quot; as it was said , building volunteers can now report in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also make inquiries concerning the reloc@@ ation of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of work@@ places , the municipal council decided to change the space utilisation plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ time@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area , which has been designated there , is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , admission is enough to them in the UK so far . &quot;
this is why big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
the lobby group &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; reck@@ ons with 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk reduction ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; while in Paris , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it also cuts down the infrastructure of Dublin as well as Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;

Gilead receives legal expenses from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ se the legal costs incurred from the hepatitis C legal dispute with the Pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co .
&quot; in June Gilead was freed by a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster medications so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , U.S. President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead was entitled to reimbur@@ se the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ alize Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck util@@ ised each other and took possession of other lab@@ our@@ ers , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State again
&quot; the U.S. supported troops reg@@ ained complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left the city , said a spokes@@ man for the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently experiencing the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as host@@ ages , shared by the D@@ KS , the D@@ KS military council of Reuters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are running clean @-@ up operations , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s Ear@@ nings Ear@@ nings 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton wrote her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the pres@@ idency candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton made an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind wrong exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not oblig@@ ated to do so by law . &quot;

&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidates for the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Consul@@ tant , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspec@@ tions are not finished . &quot;
&quot; the critics , among other things , the Repub@@ lican candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business shares and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump ask to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other candidate has done during the last decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that ump in the 1990s paid no or only very low taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in Om@@ aha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire h@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate has his seat here , dump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to IR@@ S &apos;s control and have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign has published tax return by 2007 .
&quot; Clinton , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the 2015 &apos;s tax return showed that they were only $ 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; its major investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , out of which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

Friday is World &apos;s Day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , whereby they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ well Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed from &quot; Arab &quot; prompt - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media rebellion after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election since there were Arab guests according to a staff .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; dism@@ issed his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel selection list . &quot;
&quot; the country was not listed between the countries , which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather large response from the internet , where people called the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some of them signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it had given the alleged promp@@ ts of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of yourself , &quot; &quot; it was in a different contribution , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly showed all the accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the quick @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police dism@@ is@@ ses tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ b against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students gathered together with the police in Sao Paulo , when they assembled to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police made tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to set up rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their short@@ com@@ ings about their plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the State Office Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants were surprised to spray Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er at walls .
&quot; the recent protests happened a few days after prot@@ esters in crowds went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ issed out of office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the exchange rate between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interests of Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador stated . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , another commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1,5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade @-@ swing was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian emb@@ assi@@ es gave approximately 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily to travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; searched for : beverages , Be@@ verage &quot;
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid occurred on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the issu@@ ance of cash from the staff of the drink market and then fled at first on foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver @-@ coloured VW @-@ Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was spent , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators are supposed to have been between 1,60 and 1,70 m , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is poor@@ ly view@@ able .
&quot; after the fall , the perpetr@@ ators must be scann@@ ed in direction Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel parking place located opposite the park entrance , may be fle@@ eing with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;

&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the Social Ped@@ agog@@ ical Day Group / Social group work of the children &apos;s association Nag@@ old with their assistants on their summer@@ time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holidays in the quiet surroundings Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle .
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to Bret@@ ten with a visit to the string z@@ oos .

the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and planning . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage to all the mini@@ stries in the fores@@ ee@@ able two years , the St. Anna &apos;s Higher Education Centre decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Merc@@ y , a special pilgrimage destination was given on the occasion of the Holy Year of Merc@@ y . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms made their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , priest stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , he was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster , Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman , and so the pilgrimage route took place from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and text . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is made a way to sing together a song from a dedicated pilgrims song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner hur@@ ts home when Br@@ ite won Gold for cycling
Scot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner held last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself E@@ igen . the youth took pride when he stor@@ med home to return a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed four years ago a shock@@ ing victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London railway world champ@@ ionships in London despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time to replace them .
&quot; Gary &apos;s retirement produced a gap , which K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close . &quot;
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic ord in the Quali@@ fication Round , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap he was barely back , but Kenn@@ y put the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , with the passing in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed on the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up an Olympic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys site , there was an indication that after a weak start he obviously fell on the track . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect a successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape Kenn@@ y , it is possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23rd ( a seemingly holy date for the British Sport ; on the day were also born Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that &apos;s the same as Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter races . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will be in focus .
&quot; he had fought yesterday with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the respective women &apos;s contest , which will continue and is finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archive soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB Team is rel@@ ying on its strong web @-@ wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been lowered . &quot;
&quot; Dr@@ amas left behind in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the midst of sex mus@@ cul@@ ature and mop@@ ed vor@@ tices as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like the now legendary call GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melting furnace of Port@@ land in a dou@@ bt@@ ful way due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy contract
&quot; the future of the aluminum cross@@ fade from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ate the energy supplier agreement and thus up@@ lift all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy fixed for 20 years runs in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot;
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; moreover , it could result in dom@@ ino effects because the sm@@ el@@ ting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
the melting pot of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium sm@@ ash with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the Tre@@ aties were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ gers &quot; , &quot; which should come into force since November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual turnover amoun@@ ting to $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; &quot; does not interfere . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have come into effect from November this year , even though it is still a declaration of why it res@@ igned from the Treaty . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week , head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 MW each year to generate around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner clan Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the U.S. Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , spotted reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner Family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n and the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z @-@ on@@ c@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ ant ) . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é story almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ ant brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on@@ ist at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate in this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as for the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that is more similar to a picture tape than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut fashion@@ ista ) from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Roller ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of its cover stars is expected so long@@ ingly that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin still le@@ aked out before the official announcement .
&quot; women , who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; the model &quot; as &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that woman J@@ enner , who is described as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to rotate a good Snap@@ chat Video ( even if everything applies to in@@ separ@@ ators ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers does not like success to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ ings of the moment . &quot; &quot;
these feelings co@@ ke up again when the news came out with the show J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying around on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her handmade pictures by C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she can be seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal council centers annually reject 16@@ 0,000 people &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s most au@@ xili@@ aries are rejected annually by the municipal council centers , while the industry accounts for the effects of further aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar - are rejected with regard to free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ri@@ dden , are prepared for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose more 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the director of the municipal headquarters of Que@@ en@@ land James Far@@ rell , said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal council centers found that thousands of people have already been dism@@ issed each year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without the resolution of the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Municipal Centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and crus@@ hing debts , families that have been dism@@ issed by separ@@ ations , all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the Federal Government will sh@@ orten the funding by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of more need@@ y people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we urge the General Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Justice , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these mid @-@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the State Government comp@@ lied with its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of communities and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of squ@@ ander@@ ing staff
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign was charged with alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina took a gun on one employee in February while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini announced for months to have been waiting for the matter to be governed internally , before realis@@ ing that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the head of the campaign , Earl Philip , &quot; moved on a pist@@ ol , placed his right index finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini issued in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; having compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini stated that at least four more persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to damage damage , &quot; Bord@@ ini announced . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation comes just two days after the Repub@@ lican candidate prov@@ oked an u@@ pro@@ ar when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; should take action if his ri@@ vals should be elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judge . &quot;
the campaign made it clear that the media had ri@@ pped its words out of context and that it would not cause violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is Compl@@ aint requires compensation from the campaign to viol@@ ate the duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
s &amp; D Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a statement .
trials to contact Philip proposed just as flaw@@ ed .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Repub@@ lican candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has previously led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of federal elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) are notable for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; this gave representative surveys from the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could continue to dominate , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to pose the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD suffered from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the lef@@ tist came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight loss of 6 per cent , the Gre@@ ens were reluc@@ tant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Parliament with 3 percent respectively .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched . &quot;
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice for roughly two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but they come somehow from the time of the internet era . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could send and receive a lot for that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even per fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud of the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , which means 1,@@ 400 Euro . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in August 1996 , no one could imagine that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot;
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
today vendors still dominate the market that came much later than Nokia .
&quot; being online always and everywhere , this is a lot of everyday life today . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphones in the world . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple sold 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running transactions of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are coming . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the key breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the iPhone . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , easy to use via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the success of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the chance to see . &quot;
&quot; eventually , she disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; today , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away too , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens Board of Management . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must guide the Olympic spirit and He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw won &apos;t only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already providing 10,000 new apprentic@@ es , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement he@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the two fl@@ es were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers each question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for single an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in fun growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport and the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to drive this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as to secure our future trade , and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempt to b@@ ypass the ad blocking , a &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ages on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect what part of the page is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle is underway between the open source community and the envel@@ ops already since the invention of scor@@ cer@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has gone into battle is a strong indication of how wor@@ ris@@ ome scor@@ eboard for the industry has become .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display blo@@ wers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion every day active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the adverti@@ sed Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has set it on desktop PCs on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs is a big part of the income that Facebook will make the investment of such a step worth a re@@ warding .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad prize pool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a Facebook message in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad blo@@ wers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focus on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on the Swiss motorway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presum@@ able suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss born at the age of 49 , who was over@@ riding from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , who promp@@ ted these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Court st@@ etter granted the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a coll@@ ision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers must not assume that a pedestrian prec@@ edes the highway in the middle of the night , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the casual killing after she had handed over a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and had become un@@ conscious on the street , the court conf@@ essed . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the police officer -- who responded to an emergency call -- entered a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report to the police number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabited once . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus according to tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if Venus could have revealed similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere , and nonetheless gradually sp@@ un . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but once enough water and geographic vari@@ ability had to accommodate life and protected them from ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus trans@@ forms its daily horiz@@ ons of the sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella in order to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model brought about a story of Venus that resembles evolution , presum@@ ed earlier by planet researchers . &quot;
&quot; although it was presum@@ ably inhabited , the Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burnt away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as its hydro@@ gen , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy steps back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy got back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a very low co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; commented on the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth it needs and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today Patrick was informed about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy won the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Award .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the late season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference in five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .

&quot; as a result of lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;

&quot; many stars in this star @-@ pile , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these gri@@ pping stars rep@@ el large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the mag@@ net@@ fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable stell@@ ar spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rotary mar@@ riages indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby larger stars turn slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ation@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much more to us about what we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars slow@@ ed down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the ro@@ aches of the ple@@ j@@ ads , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to both , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the league &apos;s most valuable player , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been giving him 27 million US dollars a year . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 he made several mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old shouldn &apos;t be admitted to the rest of the bas@@ eball . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his occurrence outside the square . &quot;
&quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; gave rise to ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed to 211 games due to a development in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funding for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in southern Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favour for the year 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days do not run sil@@ ently .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends occupy the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win every game , &quot; said Y@@ ank@@ ees @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee arch ri@@ val Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing events &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Pur@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a m@@ ating agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butter@@ fly , just by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the footh@@ ills of more than 50 m of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B rehear@@ sal and a hearing has been applied .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio the news se@@ eping through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation may be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot;
according to the report it should act on the banned substance for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ Probe should already be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes are not pulling the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , particularly the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another severe blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association was banned from the whole Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the L@@ umin@@ ants of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the earlier depar@@ tures in China also caused violent conflicts between the athletes . &quot;
&quot; thus , Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked Chinese Olympic champion , Sun Yang . &quot;
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun also was at the center of a confrontation with Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested by the Chinese champ@@ ionships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de , but only had to sit a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data @-@ traffic : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmers of malware programs currently attack businesses - and are successful in this process .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware anti @-@ virus specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
40 per cent of the victims paid will@@ ingly the solutions demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alise their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially black@@ mail ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the mal@@ aria programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was quickly start@@ ling over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ even changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ Stret@@ ch Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users have the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany whose patients can be threatened by the loss of acts of illness .
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explains . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ackers , in turn , know that and try everything to build a good reputation . &quot;
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the user areas and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a sort of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their cas@@ u@@ alties via chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their damage software in the form of a software building box to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits were created by the malware , providing advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the black@@ boards are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums underground , buy the set from a criminal and ordered another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals subsequently commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with the distribution , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data is no longer a sufficient threat to successful capture , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the potential for damage is much higher depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the h@@ acker conference , Def@@ con demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat under their control using the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the release of such a block@@ aded heating might well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials are well finished and pleasant , only the cock@@ pit top falls off . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles with storage space .
&quot; there is not only a boot of 45@@ 3 l available for high @-@ featured and 10@@ 26 l with flip back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less mag@@ ically than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a child seat and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the hr @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm .
&quot; however , he might be somewhat qui@@ eter to do his job . &quot;
pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
&quot; the safety systems belong to the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane keeping assistant . &quot;
the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant is very reliable .
&quot; and the smart Temp@@ or@@ eg@@ ler respon@@ ds to the traffic signs detection and , if necessary , the speed . &quot;
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , nav@@ i , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI jack lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore slightly aw@@ k@@ ward .
the roughly 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top dies@@ els are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline shall not be liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is possible only in case of dangers which are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee joint .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
illness : when does the organizer pay
&quot; after their journey , ill vac@@ ation@@ ers will only get back money if the cause of the disease is to be found without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case negotiated , a family on the second day of their Turkish holiday was seriously ill @-@ affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ists to a defective purification plant that allegedly dirty the sea@@ water .
&quot; the family believed that the trip had been flaw@@ ed , and compl@@ ained about the organisers . &quot;
&quot; in court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not have any success . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea water was al@@ right .
&quot; he has therefore not infr@@ ing@@ ed his duty of information , thus judgment . &quot;
im@@ pur@@ ities were not found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belongs to the general life risk .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; after the violent acts pursued by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said many people had concerns about other attacks . &quot;
the state must be ref@@ using and determined at the same time on terror .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot;
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders need to leave the country faster , this increases security and also am@@ ends the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement proposals until the 2017 Bundestag elections .
&quot; he also announced further personnel rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely &quot; in a medium @-@ scale magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympath@@ etic advertising for terrorism must be under punishment . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the right of arms is to be passed so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be more difficult . &quot;
the recently discussed silence of silence for doctors should be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions how the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister has a better social support . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ sed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD CEO Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly opposed action .
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of the double nationality . &quot;
&quot; constitutional Compl@@ aint in the &quot; &quot; M@@ oll@@ ath Case &quot; &quot; Succ@@ ess@@ ful &quot;
one cannot for@@ bid everything that one re@@ jects and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses before the court .
&quot; the Green Party leader Simone Peter challenged the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terrorist acts of vig@@ or and ability to manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet of Pro@@ verbs and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the right of residence bring people no longer safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway zu@@ br@@ inger
it st@@ ows regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture from November .
but that is to change : the right balance should be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car riders who stand in traffic on the ambient street every night in traffic , if they drive over the motorway in Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) , the road construction will be extended in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit Wes@@ eler road , the right bend track by 700 metres . &quot;
drivers can then tap right from the Hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : traffic is split up early , thereby improving the overall operating sequence on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U Group in the district of Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the driving train at the Zu@@ br@@ inger is driving the drivers above all between 17 and 19 hours .
&quot; on week@@ days , the back road goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h trail and sometimes beyond . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the eye @-@ eye @-@ eye on the B 51 is just before the exit Wes@@ eler road . &quot;
&quot; from here , traffic is only steering a single track across the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back in three @-@ quarters of years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had yiel@@ ded that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load capacity , in order to take the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected half @-@ day traffic will continue , the responsible state of the country cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to come , the bridge has an official remaining period of remaining until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal department store , the state @-@ owned company deliberately selected the traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays , because it has to be reck@@ oned with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will be run on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule came to visit the &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the Association of N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from eleven to fifteen years visited the production in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class have come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible to follow the course of action nonetheless , thus the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Sprach@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December youth with and without escape and migration background should be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language teaching are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star @-@ sni@@ pp@@ ets : hope of weather improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ sni@@ pping Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south west of Germany on Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see a lot of star@@ fish in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ry scales are per@@ sei@@ ls , which at 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is going on in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , you roll out etern@@ ally , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep well before the wake @-@ up ring . &quot;
that &apos;s all but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults suffer in@@ som@@ nia and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be a variety of causes behind them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ert , member of the board of the German Society for Sl@@ at Dec@@ eption and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , so an entr@@ ace and a sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; the result is that many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or uns@@ atis@@ factory , says Jens Wagner &apos;s ne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs . &quot;
in@@ frequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is common especially for a depression , &quot; says We@@ evil . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly cat@@ ches to worry about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and the day is com@@ promised , you should go to the doctor , advise the process . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look quite different : tired , tired , tired , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , established sleep medi@@ ums hardly exist , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , director of the interdisciplinary medical center at the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleep problems one should contact the family doctor first , &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab and what happens ?
&quot; for the examination in the sleep lab , physicians advise for example snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , in case of abnormal daily fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturb@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after disgu@@ sting you go to bed at its normal time .
&quot; apart from the electrodes on the body , one wearing a nas@@ al cann@@ ula , a chest strap and a sensor on your finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is drawing on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can put a better sleep .
&quot; on the other hand , it is not possible to sleep in bed , sleep not too long , do not watch television for sleep , stop drinking alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s completely and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler sold himself via Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first brought gold at the world champ@@ ionships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook proudly presented himself in front of his ex @-@ team mates . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king of 150,000 € shouldn &apos;t be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the conveying system in swimming is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely or even operate on dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you cannot control a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS of independent inspec@@ tors of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not take part , &quot; says the choice @-@ ham@@ burger which meanwhile operates an ice cream shop . &quot;
airport : gang of Bag@@ gage Al@@ lies arrested
professional Thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civil investig@@ ators of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and bags as ban@@ de .
&quot; at 9 : 30 pm , civil servants from the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the police from past Dieb@@ st@@ ahl@@ s@@ del@@ ik@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several dol@@ ences for the mid @-@ July of this year , and have worked very professionally and professionally . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Cri@@ min@@ em Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 are able to demonstrate four acts , specifically aimed at perpet@@ rating criminal off@@ ences in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had captured more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few tree @-@ trees , in between a remn@@ ant cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not affect the first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , you pass play@@ grounds , a newly painted nursery and a beer shop . &quot;
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house !
&quot; opposite of a Li@@ dl , which will soon be dem@@ ol@@ ished , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants rented car rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Interior Minister H@@ enkel recorded a hard action of the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ mi@@ ths , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol the police for three weeks , with 30 to 40 officers and three teams on the spot , blocked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile the building workers renovated the spaces on behalf of unknown home@@ owners .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administration court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers went down under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street acts peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main priority of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the area since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is here three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they share the concern of rising mi@@ ds and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; , &quot; who wished for several police protection against v@@ andal@@ ous lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Interior Minister and the police between house owners and their neighbours , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class district , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer road very close to Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been ev@@ acu@@ ated under a rule of law in a regular street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alised and partly still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the city district has become increasingly popular for tourists and bal@@ ers from all over the world over the past few years : residents of GDR times and former home @-@ owners now share their neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on designed pan@@ es or painted faç@@ ades that have been disc@@ ar@@ ded with color bags .
&quot; this year , no other street was mentioned so often in conjunction with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours look at it as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury are reported almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences make property damage , which tends to make new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the R@@ ī@@ ga .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drag@@ ged into the R@@ ī@@ ga Street .
&quot; it was therefore important for her to get back to her streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by un@@ covering new buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in fact , these are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - rather people living here are rather people who are not so well @-@ ready , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never li@@ stens to somebody ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the building projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood .
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who is moving into a pub life can complain about noise there . &quot;
everyone named only with first names has asked not to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , migrant workers , refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else are involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the uns@@ ett@@ ling Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ au , which primarily has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ ck than rather targeted at the multitude of desired tasks - meant that administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an experience in Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ au . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not the central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; first of all , it is about organising , working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;

&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
new containers are coming up in the wet street
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the follow @-@ up refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the annex@@ ation .
they must subordin@@ ate the refugees to their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for building , rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the respon@@ s@@ ability changes from the State Council to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; in fact , the administration does not find private homes . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work so that one relies on private apartments , says Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be made as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so soon , new containers are set up in the &quot; &quot; W@@ as@@ enstraße &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a firm stay , there are intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and job opportunities for refugees and migrants who have to be ti@@ ghtened or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , perform non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; activity , however , does not only mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people must develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so we need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; thus , administration and volunteers are also jumping here . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time meaning@@ fully , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; however , problem cases exist , customers say hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing is about . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces be afraid of radic@@ alisation , even in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customers say quite clearly , &quot; what may call nai@@ ve . &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ inations bring them away completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , Haupt@@ - and Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers must look for activities on site and in the region . &quot;
they have always been in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors itself . &quot;
it is actually unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already started to ration@@ ally integrate the people up to date .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women are united . &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated as there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar wanted with helicopter
the police helicopter escaped different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men have moved for@@ ci@@ bly into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. on Friday morning .
the people surprised the two and beat the gang into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.70 metres in size , probably mas@@ k@@ ered , wore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ch@@ lis . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; to commemor@@ ate the murder , the police set several squ@@ ir@@ rels as well as a helicopter . &quot;
the prosecution was without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , in fact , fell close to the apartment or during their escape . &quot;
