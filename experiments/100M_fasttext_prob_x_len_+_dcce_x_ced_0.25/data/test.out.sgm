<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the Sports Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer looked for a little variation with a ride on the beach with some colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they drove home to the troughs in a quick gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he had his family run over the system of ALRV, on a horse he did not even look for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport assistant handed the man out of Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden sport pyramids.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no shortage of the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Grand Cross, Silver Laurel, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already made it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize-winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, on Saturday, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has promoted the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 Euro as well."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master-champion was included on Saturday in the" Hall of Fame of the German Sports. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the winners were the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rowers Werner Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rowers Werner Hanisch, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the skipper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumum the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports leagues came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza price ran."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP's trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are unjust in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep things small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to taxing the economy to death and to regulate deaths, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively revoke regulations, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain duties to fulfil, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, dump and Clinton are almost wordless."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate demonstrates the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be bipartisan discussions on the dump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and rebuild coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement will cease."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and challenge the Renewable Energy with its investment program:" "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - also with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the Transpazific Trade Agreement, do not want to sign either."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but rather simply protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should then be paid better, say Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rust, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands the dump, which wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">"escape:" "every escaped woman has experience with sexual violence" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs almost to everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at the most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is an area manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are chicken.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodation for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs has created the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - also not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence in her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopeless carriers." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"women predominate other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">It drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, that goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugs call for a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they arrived in Germany, is wrong, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, single-standing women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children have certainly not come up voluntarily." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodations only for them, urges Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer no."</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing as governments in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesperson of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are some common shelters or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodation units exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the Committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are hosted separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is lacking, or will men and women be accommodated together, it can become - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washrooms should be easily accessible and accessible for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">How much women can feel this need of protection can be read at the Andrang in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have talked about that there is us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily raise a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance specialists have called their union to approve new work campaigns in their dispute over a new treaty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for its entire Council to approve more work events from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" persistently calm "to problems, leading to the fact that the Treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "in view of this, the JDC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official re-negotiations with all your worries."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the silence of the government, the JDC Board has today set a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work trials which begins in early September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the litigations led to the fact that assistance doctors, this year, strike six times, the first total failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the leader of the BMA assistant physicians, Dr. Johann Malavana, came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the sessions, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be beneficial and accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up their hands and to announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile was brightly, and he radiated hardly any heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even be improved."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper describing Erdogan had behaved as if anything bad had happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for me, his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness revealed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the crime was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the confidence becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan, first and foremost, needs all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed by a failed coup d" état in almost his office last month. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-long onslaught to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television estimated cheaper fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish farm imports are permitted."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there lang, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West since its reaction to the attempted seizure of power is regarded as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued gruelling of the snail-empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is piped to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that after the attempted coup d'état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regiment."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray a" alliance of outsiders "to me: two countries, who violate themselves from the West and are badly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposite sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said at the press conference that they would not even have striped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided a question of their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders will at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is said (in Russian) that he later became Secretary of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Government."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on his appointment, he said to Putin:" thank you for your confidence. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and controls in order to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was for a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin, and works as he works for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff repeats his own wish."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed for great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks addressed to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaints for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, confusing ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the Northern deck of Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closing statements of the" "ceiling blower" "that will approach completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 lashes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"economic Minister Keith Brown today visited the construction site today, and was one of the first to travel from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering craft of a truly epic dimension in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a sensitive activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, nearly 79% of the total deck-deck-deck-deck chairs are in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck now in Rosyth, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project is the closure of trendsetting high- and low-construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last road covering and its connection with the North turmtop located in the extension, we had to close the gap between the north or the south side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern loading bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances, on which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">"in future, the SPD and the Greens believe that investors are expected to be much stronger in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig is lost almost 1300 budget apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD is proposing a" "action concept" "for the next council meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But conflict is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "we are united with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas in future, has to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big issue in the town hall is, as Bratmann says," How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing development program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is to provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem is that Bratmann says: "there is currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"no matter what, so Bratman, a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action concept is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the programme is not entirely new: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how can one compare the loss of additional around 1,300 cheap apartments whose funding will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of being able to get apartments back into the price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west-city they run for the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be found there back into the price range for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing associations."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West city again drastically increases, they are removed from the aim of so-called confusion."</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"said vice-president Holger Herlitschke:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I have concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that there is not yet a compromise to be found.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside, but prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been sued by many over the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games, and finally on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I am of course referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena in pop culture fell in interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in the beginning of July something."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers were overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder, and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they were found" photographed "(using a screenshot on the mobile) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game resulted in a considerable rise in steps that the" average "person refuted each day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"cardio, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people, who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take 30 minutes to" come from the sofa, "and" to be active every day, "launched on deaf ears because many public messages are dull to health and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonder of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun to them.</seg>
<seg id="22">"three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt for new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also worms that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and its use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="11">"her overall result of 62,198 was clearly before the Silver medallists and" Final Five "team champion Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafa."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish bar during the individual multi-campaign of women in gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual woman winning a multi-battle title and the fifth, while strengthening its reputation, to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as the unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated their sport in the last three years, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises winning a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic winner of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"it expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlets, but rather between it and a burden of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as disappointment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after having won gold and silver in the individual multi-campaign of women in the gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>

<seg id="28">"she again took 15,433 on the floating beam again - and, with a 15,933 on the ground, she got another one."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her closeness - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake on Mustafa was going."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old team captain, called" Oma, "had a lead."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone and Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish and Madison Kocian, which is Katholikin, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnast female was Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">"last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2."</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic winner and America was cheering."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-times world champions of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful Gymastics routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we are experiencing the top of this sport, but we don't see gyms all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all struck the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics are a costlier sport and gymnasts are primarily held in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents responsible for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these associations, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started exercising."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we must aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, provide an affordable and easy accessible exercise."</seg>
<seg id="23">I have established my Turnstiftung for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 masturbans (especially black and hispanic) and train national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits to health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of" Girl Power "by the holding of the Olympic team golds and thank you, you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud thrive in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities are knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, attaches verbally to the police, election observers and Rathoffenders to ignore proof of election abuse on account of" oversensitivity in ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and municipal government, which is now an interim leader, said that the intimidation of voters from religious grounds would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elective cabs to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should take a card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must merely name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable ink on a person's finger, when they vote on their voting voice to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He urges that the press should have more access to municipal documentation and decisions of non-official committees or workgroups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Election Committee in the East of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a Special Court decided that the current mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "in a cynical way" "and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation when one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarming to the fraudulent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guiding of ways to prove identity."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it is stated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There have been concerns that... state institutions have knowingly ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity concerning ethnics and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists are editing letter templates to stop" reelection. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is taken into consideration by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing after your identification.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not use removable ink on a person's finger, as soon as she has handed her voice to prevent someone to choose twice."</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications to an automatic lettering.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists are editing full letterings and envelopes from letterings.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set off barriers to recruit elective stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"a change of law, which facilitates an indictment for intimidation according to the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Legislation Act 1983)."</seg>
<seg id="31">Ban on photographing in elective stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters alone go to the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it astounding that after the Tower Hamlets case no criminal complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings - guilty.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "AbhakControl" of the constituent registers of the Town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spreading of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to rotate the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you approach you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the shot line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free Ellbows.</seg>
<seg id="7">"beat him with his knees in the bar and twisted, while the attacker crushes against pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards as they turn the weapon to him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and turn it, so that the attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and turn the weapon to it."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and throws of serious testing by checking out some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk aborted his course on a Euro ticket, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing head of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show up and show us what he will get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment made under the title" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "brought some surprising results to the daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leaking the rinsing knob of a pulling toilette that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he lequed, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public handrails at train stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task ceased to put his immune system under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about what concerns my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was justified in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proofing showed a luminometry number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to that, the Luminometre number is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after their Luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the film" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," It's close to the worst that I got in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will not dock here, because it is disgusting here indoors."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company has validated Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of gut bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valio Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we conducted mad brainstorming, which ended that we said" Let us call Ian. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film director, added:" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he checked out some of the things I have instructed him, like the hectic Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to stop them and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Glad we recorded some of these dirty tricks on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents registered lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of gastrointestinal and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family abandoned her social housing after a deduction of £50,000, because she terrorized her neighbours."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"once they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found property in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"walls showed clearing holes, wooden floorboards were torn up, garbage was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think that people don't have to live this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is as well.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skelby, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the property, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours say they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police to be invoked.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing made her and her partner violently by the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the dollies were cheered by lightened neighbours, who said their life was made to hell."</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They shot at no one."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years apart from them and it was always terrible.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today, we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have failed to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long."</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the church building, garbage and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant pretended to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, as a delogation is always the final step taken into consideration by Cornwall Housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and had to be terrible at all for their neighbours."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have boldly approached us and gave us the information we have provided."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the decoration on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the property management now have to dream garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found about 70g cannabis as well as scales, parapheralia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Skelby was given a fine, after having found guilty of the owner of a drug of class B in commercial property."</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 during a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after having been without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the rooms of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say that they will run tenants who do not stick to house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow told the police of Devon and Cornwall stating that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach as well as those who were harmed by such a behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"anyone who doesn't fit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even be" a few hundred thousand, "the chairman of the chairman Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh disaster of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already covered Kurdish high-bursts with sanctions, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the miserable putsch, secular and oppositional Ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees, produces refugees in their own country," "said Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the director complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"with this, Erdogan is aiming to increase the pressure to the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," "said Toprak, who is also a CDU member."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the land day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the election of the country will not again be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"as far as so far, it does not go: summer holidays, heat and land mass struggle - that bites itself."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the electors, are on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee on the way, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the land day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays helpers, the posters hang up, inflate balloons, circulate flyers and count out voices, only laboriously apply."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is forced to pass an election campaign barely on the people past."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, when you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: premier Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, which has been the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomers AfD cut off and what remains at the end of coalition fit.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuously active election campaign, one sees from its large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, roses roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, marinering has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel blames the blossoms of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We create that "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with their candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to commemorations; Merkel's President of the Bundestag is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely waives the usual campaign levels on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that means coking, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that on the country, its base is crumbling, that it must be very strict, to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the expanse of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU candidate Kokert to his comrades is also self-debunked:" "you must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village este, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is on the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the S & D Group last stood at 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD was still able to win even 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the leap into the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and share their campaign of great advantage on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign," it calls the chairman Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"apart from that, green election setups go on track search for local voice-makers among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, kurvt straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and finds it even beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and only ends at 8 pm, there is always praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything pretty crunchy," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet gas station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the beginning of the week, the construction site was scheduled to be relocated to the south at half-time, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the objectification of those responsible for construction work is also vowed, such as when it comes to the establishment of makeshift drives."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was immigrated to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 back on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The road traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant complaints," says the deputy director Florian King responsible for the management of the remediation management. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachlerstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping channels were searching and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were frank.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not met, the municipality increasingly called for the trade fair from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," "says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot."</seg>

<seg id="20">"for the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue losses, everyone who is asked to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" "end customer" "are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "most slight drop", "but also admits that" the running search is missing. ""</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, if there is a financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÖHNER white from other districts, where something more generous was handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who buys gramophone records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section, to sow it under the pseudonym non-Allegrim Men's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much-up resurgence of gramophone records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but due to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers prefer their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wildly stuffy before I stay, hold my hands and determine something like:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho sits slowly in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there still remains a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, by Sister Ray (number of numbers: two young women, three men middle aged) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford to buy, when he was young and pledged."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70ies, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and add:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people tend to get rid of their collection since 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs now to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom in followers of the record label of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers kicked off the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, of objects that wake up happy cheers."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions than a kind of consolation," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee instills from a pile of records."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player, whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I am wondering through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of numbers: three men middle aged), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," "I don't own record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who come first slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience than I enter."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women middle aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beasts's newest synthesizer and sextet Pop instead of experimental jazz drumming from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks odd, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to imagine if you stand alongside someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a window-shopping as a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't earn much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives with a loving sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record holders: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"as I admit to patterns the jeans ties, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid Cameras, before a father and his daughter think about buying a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one who has the most for luxuries like panels."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my investigations yielded that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collector's and plate lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they do not spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stroll through record shops of the Berwick Street and the leaves through boards, while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake moderator that sticks above the shoulders above the shoulders of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"at a trial trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops, in which individuals sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hair services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and that would be a fire and sanitation risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups judged the Court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also noted that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the precipice was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp serving as charity and offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase in newcomers during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the impressive performance of Britain at 7-7 Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji distributed a master class in the handling, side steppe, backrest, line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was lost by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals the same day could fall back to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji could have hit a 15-man-team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it's probably not - that at least a Briton will hang a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost every game at Adelaide Sevens under Ryan."</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and dismissed the attacks of GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell to and Co. to run into driving busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 up, when Osea Kolinisau rushed across the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he changed."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a dominating Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute athlete jasa Veremalua in the right hand a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the revival and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak tacklings of the GB team and rushed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB was still there."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes which was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been running for a long time in favor of the South Seems, whose fans sang, wave flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>

<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.3 undepressed application, which is also unparalleled."</seg>

<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, in case that in such circumstances is the right term."</seg>

<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory her first thoughts came to Williams, who spent an annoying morning talking about anything else than usual, trying to handle his own fears."</seg>

<seg id="27">The couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began closing, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let oneself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking forward to doing something olles.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the branch out of the eco-electricity promotion are of the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the German steel industry, Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) spoke of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that after two years we could finally reach tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"at first, the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to the cashier."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros a year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy is 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for the production of own power.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo is largely written to the previous regulation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others need to follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," said IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel branch in Europe suffers from overcapacity and a significant price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation escalated further than the world's largest producer in China threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers throw price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, import duties have been shown on import-steel effects, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have intensified."</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear is how sustainably the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp wanted to conclude at last also closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"around 12,000 people were employed in the German steel industry by the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's studies she occupied the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of the music, describes Hoackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often, social and family structures are often disconnected, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir: "to be able to speak and organise themselves to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly request their lungs get out of the puste in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generation, joint singing had a much higher priority; it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz frequently observes that singing or hearing songs in elderly people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, people critically reflect on long recumbent events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing, the head will also require a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, concentrating on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just older people who live alone are doing so, not just concentrating on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate, even if he thinks that you have little talent, Lenz tells you."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears that when a sound goes down next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"when searching for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone from the acquaintance of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choir choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to sing, you should join a choir, betray Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous investigation, the team of researchers has already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens screams differs with the urgency of their dependency."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult male and eight female queens were observed from the MHH animal husbandry.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a crib of babies who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their findings in spite of the low sample of meaningful information.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who had not had their own offspring, responded differently to the cries," "said Konerding."</seg>
<seg id="15">They swiftly turned to the loudspeaker when this calls of the very cold kittens played off.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be innate or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"one surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "said the biologist."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby noise."</seg>

<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai people were killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning two explosives went up again, and according to the authorities another human being was killed."</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation near the beach, popular beach beach Patong, a taxi driver was injured."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, which killed a municipal staff."</seg>

<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings bear the same signature," "said Army eneral Danai Kritylavee Friday morning before journalists."</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express itself to possible motives, but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks, typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage restricted to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities would have received confidential information on impending attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed of the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">Still unclear which group falls behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police declared their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bomb attacks, but mostly they do not address tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace that was used over years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"following the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities."</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) suffered for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This also gives the military considerable influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">"junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, withdrew itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">"almost a year ago, there were 20 people killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games and World Records are not always determining the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics centre, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia is so slow that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures at times."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte was subsequently transformed into the viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a setback of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"because in Ethiopia most athletes run, Habte simply wanted to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first names quickly made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media described him as "rouble of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" prosperity bump, "the English tabloids" The Sun "made fun of him with" Dad Bod. ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds on the 100 meters open-style, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani caused media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a pre-run over 100 meters of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that adjoins the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can transform into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are blended, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All malignments arrive at the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app of Blackface beneficial or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and darker cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature from Asians -" aunted face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and the indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat informed that it turned off the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of vulnerable clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison decidedly.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet has been widely spread over the photos that the filter" "vulnerable and" "canceled was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not secured, but that the yellow face has been pulled down to the extreme extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of integrity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's big audience of young people - who are more diversed in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchat filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and others decided to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that race-related controversies reflect lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently focused on personnel managers, focusing on subrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts."</seg>
<seg id="28">"on their part, Zhu said they will have closed their Snapchat account and added," "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not O.K.". ""</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual conditions were allowed on site, reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Military Revolutionary Committee, secret service committees and the military budget committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, just Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence official information, typically sent off by high-ranking CentCom commanders, regularly reported a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer, if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their laws, to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015 many Central Command Press Releases, statements and statements made before the congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report highlighted. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom affiliated publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed insights while continuing the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of CentCom are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee announced their own findings that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 CentCom established an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the supreme Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process," Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morals among analysts and "gave moderately little space to divergent opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clues to a White House intervention at CentCom Analysts in terms of a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, who were taken up after complaints by CentCom Analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"according to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, there was a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for the ehran inestimation of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of divisions of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a piece of writing about how the former government under George W. Bush objected only a small creeping force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led Mr. Hooker to provide government officials that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State could have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since these tentative refineries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damala commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive appraisal of the situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retiring in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed player will take a little longer from the path leading the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may run on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising vortex with their success story four years after they landed on the last of 12 places at the last London Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters playing the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workspace in London we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can snatch the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gateaux in the first half of the game with a setback from the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into play without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the match from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a sprint with the flat ball across the left flank, then pulled into the middle and loaded the ball into the door to get the American female 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a furious easel between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed from the wristband to the swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's warm with dimples, could well have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if it were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampoline jumping around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not universally recognized: airguns, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I'm modest to make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was perceived the last 16 years so sparse that many that I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic portart at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on trampolines and until 2012 had made an athlete who made it up to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who are for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on trampolines has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clownsschool than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never to end benevolent prelude, but also the Grazie of gymnasium and diving, the two types of sports that it essentially unites."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" jumping-board. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling movements (turning, biting and salts) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are rated according to official Olympiaprogram after execution, level of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-time athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists have to go to gold in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and back, upwards and downwards on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they chase not only the finish line or the baseline, but also another highlight in the TV transmission: that of the world or the Olympic ord."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the target-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator into tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find myself when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightlessly as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is a competition too, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It's such a Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final hours of women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, which the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2pm.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear-monkeys and the objective male athletes - as the male US turbines recently proposed, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community according to the air."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protesting" "in Ethiopia, Long, ally an ally of the USA"</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's non-violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that seventy protesters were killed during clashes with the police in gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past few months protests against the government shook the country and widened in more and more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was merciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen injured on seventy unarmed demonstrators killed and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security workers strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights now demands an incoming enquiry.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, with dissidents being silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a vast choice last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea, a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years were more or less forced to exploit turmoil and to arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of debiting under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media since cheaper smartphone became more and more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government closes the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still talk about Internet proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orocosmos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, which are predominantly Christian high-nationals from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairedly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, in secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, until his death on a not publicized illness in 2012 was 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to deal with opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively inscrutable reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested against elections that were apparently pledged by the government and then stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters held in Gondar, an amperic city, of Tigray held businesses and hatred against the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama has established ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday, Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the" founder "of the Islamic State terrorist group."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligible with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings out his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful period in protection, to explain in the peculiar position, assertions that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made an event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump insisted on the statement on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the opposition to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate did not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of critique will bounce down on Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposal would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he criticized a strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "Of course, I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observing the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he's clever enough to keep his assertions vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive tone since its survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is intensifying the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps fired his loyal co-workers into the unconvenient situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," "Mr. Giuliani, therefore, asked Mr. Giuliani to be mistaken if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it hind legs, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an outsider, allowed ISIS to spread out aggressively in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of roaming about each of his words and against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocks the" poor, miserable "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't! ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked over Mr. Trumps' apology as only proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and both food historics.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COA last book" Chop Suey "acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book" 97 Orchard "talked about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, carrified snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock crash 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"54, ordered a fresh water sandwich with olive-pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered hacky meat, this was the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap food that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have put itself in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"crews of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pastas for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "traces the ways in which the country turned out to be no longer the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central theme," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was equally tense: mysterious foods like loaves and casseroles became staple foods, which recycle the casserolle as a" wonderful way of regenerating food residues, "noted Ziegelman because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange compounds have been tried, because a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction had primacy to taste or even healthy dishes."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes prescriptions, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at midday," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not suitable for each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since, household economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country such."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" household politicians "and to meet the challenge of turning Pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historic delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-food-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer's kitchen in his kitchen, he feeds like the millionth man of the world he has become."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and provided a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully strange.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually occurs only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination aboard the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland is only 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it is just 1.220 metres wide on average."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates at a speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle embossed by slowness seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolutionary biologist assumed long that Greenland's Stone Age would become a stone age."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thinly settled coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow-pentagony sense them, when they presented six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seals, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for carcass looking down from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönland haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins that it contains will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"after the early 1960s, their birth was to lie in the atmosphere as a nuclear weapon search for large quantities of this radioactive carbon."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in comparison with 220 centimeters length of the third-smallest animal, the lens, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lenticular nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 watch showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland-shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters would be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign an age to their length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the multiplication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon of harpoon, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals often also runs on flames."</seg>
<seg id="36">"so, they mature later - and age more slowly."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal feeds heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as many offspring as possible early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should instead invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottlands Callum Skinner held last night in the men's team Sprint in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself Eigen. the youth took pride when he stormed home to return a victory from the favourites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed four years ago a shocking victory while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London railway world championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time to replace them.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gary's retirement produced a gap, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close."</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner won an Olympic ord in the Qualification Round, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap he was barely back, but Kenny put the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, with the passing in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow, said:" "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 at the Kenny and Hoys site, there was an indication that after a weak start he obviously fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he said," "It feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect a successful five days at the Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the shape Kenny, it is possible that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23rd (a seemingly holy date for the British Sport; on the day were also born Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That's the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny takes part next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal race of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four odometer races."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will be in focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought yesterday with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the respective women's contest, which will continue and is finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archive soon of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB Team is relying on its strong web-wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been lowered."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas left behind in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April in the midst of sex musculature and moped vortices as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like the now legendary call GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting furnace of Portland in a doubtful way due to the abolition of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminum crossfade from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminate the energy supplier agreement and thus uplift all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy fixed for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake."</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"moreover, it could result in domino effects because the smelting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa joined Point Henry Schmelzer, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting pot of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, supplying the large aluminium smash with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the complex is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," shared the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the Treaties were so-called" "hedgers", "which should come into force since November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17," said the current supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual turnover amounting to $187 million in" "anticipation of cancellation". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the smelting or to ensure the power supply to the smelting" "does not interfere."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have come into effect from November this year, even though it is still a declaration of why it resigned from the Treaty."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before the closure of the Portland Schmelzer in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week, head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 MW each year to generate around 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generating set it would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the U.S. Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," "Kendall wrote."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), spotted reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner Family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn and the presence of the most popular show biz-oncels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacant)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché story almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacant brought the sentence," You thought we had forgotten you? "with the honesty of a cartoonist at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as for the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that is more similar to a picture tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut fashionista) from the 832 pages of the Roller (615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of its cover stars is expected so longingly that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin still leaked out before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women, who were already on the cover, include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities, "the model" as "models, the celebrities are" on the cover. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that woman Jenner, who is described as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls under the previous category, is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to rotate a good Snapchat Video (even if everything applies to inseparators).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners does not like success to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them" the mistings of the moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings coke up again when the news came out with the show Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the missmut seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="2">"e-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator was launched."</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The unit weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite clumsy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight Megabytes, which would suffice for roughly two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros fans can buy the equipment on the internet, but they come somehow from the time of the internet era."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as an "office in the western pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could send and receive a lot for that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even per fax was the communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, which means 1,400 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in August 1996, no one could imagine that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era."</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today vendors still dominate the market that came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"being online always and everywhere, this is a lot of everyday life today."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow won't only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrows, just like in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>

<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two fles were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers each question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for single an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in fun growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport and the whole of the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalks in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabited once."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus according to tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine if Venus could have revealed similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and nonetheless gradually spun."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once enough water and geographic variability had to accommodate life and protected them from evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus transforms its daily horizons of the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella in order to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model brought about a story of Venus that resembles evolution, presumed earlier by planet researchers."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was presumably inhabited, the Venus -- in the course of several billions years --was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as its hydrogen, there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star-pile are rotating at different rates, and in what context the rotational periods with planet formation arise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other Sternenhaufen, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sternenhaufen of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this star-pile, which originated some 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotation rates, these gripping stars repel large amounts of constellations."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as these winds travel through the magnetfields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars."</seg>
<seg id="10">"when a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable stellar spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of rotary marriages indicates that more massive stars revolve more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rebull compares the stars with dancers, whereby larger stars turn slowly pirouettes as smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotationism."</seg>

<seg id="1">Data-traffic: so perfide presses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of malware programs currently attack businesses - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware anti-virus specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims paid willingly the solutions demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially blackmail ransom is significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski talking to the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malaria programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was quickly startling over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for uneven changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of CryptoStretch Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users have the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely interrupt the operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany whose patients can be threatened by the loss of acts of illness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains. "</seg>
<seg id="21">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the hackers, in turn, know that and try everything to build a good reputation."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have investigated the user areas and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a sort of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their casualties via chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to retrieve their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is about three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software in the form of a software building box to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits were created by the malware, providing advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackboards are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and ordered another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected calculator.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V, Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds rather overloaded, but the HR V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it doesn't work in any place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the interior materials are well finished and pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles with storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a boot of 453 l available for high-featured and 1026 l with flip backrests, but there is the" Magic Seats. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magically than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a child seat and thus offer storage space, which is up to 1.24 m from the floor to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the hr-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he might be somewhat quieter to do his job."</seg>
<seg id="13">Pleasing is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the safety systems belong to the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and the smart Temporegler responds to the traffic signs detection and, if necessary, the speed."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navi, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack lie under the armrest and are therefore slightly awkward.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesels are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you roll out eternally, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep well before the wake-up ring."</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults suffer insomnia and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes behind them, stresses Hans-Günter Weert, member of the board of the German Society for Slat Deception and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands, however, is the Insomnia, so an entrace and a sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the result is that many people feel unsatisfactory or unsatisfactory, says Jens Wagner's necht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common especially for a depression," says Weevil. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly catches to worry about everyday problems and worries, there's an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and the day is compromised, you should go to the doctor, advise the process."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look quite different: tired, tired, tired, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, established sleep mediums hardly exist, Prof. Ingo Fietze, director of the interdisciplinary medical center at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleep problems one should contact the family doctor first,"</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the examination in the sleep lab, physicians advise for example snoring with breathing exercises, in case of abnormal daily fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not make a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After disgusting you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"apart from the electrodes on the body, one wearing a nasal cannula, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera is drawing on the ceiling to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can put a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"on the other hand, it is not possible to sleep in bed, sleep not too long, do not watch television for sleep, stop drinking alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then one starts to reckon immediately, and that's completely and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="5">"article about this" trendy district, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants rented car rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Interior Minister Henkel recorded a hard action of the police against the project, the area referred to as" no-go zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadmiths, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrol the police for three weeks, with 30 to 40 officers and three teams on the spot, blocked off parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile the building workers renovated the spaces on behalf of unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administration court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers went down under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street acts peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main priority of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the area since 1999, and Jana *, who is here three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the skin projects, they share the concern of rising mids and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a" "Kiez", "who wished for several police protection against vandalous leftists."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin Interior Minister and the police between house owners and their neighbours, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class district, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer road very close to Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under a rule of law in a regular street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalised and partly still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the city district has become increasingly popular for tourists and balers from all over the world over the past few years: residents of GDR times and former home-owners now share their neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on designed panes or painted façades that have been discarded with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"this year, no other street was mentioned so often in conjunction with the words" left-autonomous violence. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours look at it as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury are reported almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the largest part of the criminal offences make property damage, which tends to make new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately dragged into the Rīga Street.</seg>
<seg id="31">"it was therefore important for her to get back to her streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly stressed the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by uncovering new buildings in former mosquitoes that displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in fact, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many - rather people living here are rather people who are not so well-ready," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not approve." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens to somebody?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are coming up in the wet street</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the follow-up refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the annexation.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must subordinate the refugees to their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for building, rent or renovations of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsability changes from the State Council to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in fact, the administration does not find private homes."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work so that one relies on private apartments, says Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common dwellings need to be made as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so soon, new containers are set up in the" "Wasenstraße". ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a firm stay, there are internships, apprenticeships, training places, one-euro jobs and job opportunities for refugees and migrants who have to be tightened or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homework, perform non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"activity, however, does not only mean work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People must develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so we need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"thus, administration and volunteers are also jumping here."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, problem cases exist, customers say honestly," people with whom nothing is about. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task". ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two after the recent occurrences be afraid of radicalisation, even in a small municipality like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine's customers say quite clearly, "what may call naive." a residual risk could and would not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassinations bring them away completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, Haupt- and Volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher have already started to rationally integrate the people up to date.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women are united."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated as there are no simple answers.</seg>
