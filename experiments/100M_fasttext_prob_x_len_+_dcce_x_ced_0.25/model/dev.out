Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and poses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the two continues to deterior@@ ate due to the deal promoted by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program .
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu said at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress a controversial speech , partly classified as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election ahead of Israel in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend shot to have shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb spoke with a somewhat sensitive voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his home . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , scrat@@ ching on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi , had already sent 300 miles to the school site , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ester Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emer@@ gen@@ cies after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police ch@@ ained him .
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; details , as well as what students and collabor@@ ators who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself men@@ tions lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both established in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to be problematic .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked Delta State University to have a leave of absence for health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
&quot; this year , he only taught two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would have no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after fle@@ eing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Spur , when he returned from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as again in Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb began his work in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and studied geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he obtained his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when she met together with friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
at that time he was the warm woman .
&quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson City of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the rec@@ alled lamb , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends remained and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September after Lamb finishes his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic@@ iel in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were clean and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was the president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people participated in the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ si@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb did the emergency after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb was called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
&quot; toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated anne@@ x and a arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time @-@ travel movie ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia strengthened military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Chief again ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the meeting of the General Assembly during this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ ts that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ban called for the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they proved in at@@ taining a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a breakdown .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks when asking down , it has ( yet ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to wonder seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate fund . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will likely win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising her@@ man Cain , none of whom won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth can now detect tri@@ b@@ umps through staying power and begin to run their dollars , to overthrow it . &quot;
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa announced last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good view of plat@@ former .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with dump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten said they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as ump ( 43 per cent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Repub@@ lican Elec@@ tors say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would become the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see the temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of the Iranian elec@@ tors believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters are getting used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their nest @-@ hats , Repub@@ lican elec@@ torate Tr@@ ump is for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump was the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination towards only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters see the campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ ump leadership , while the anti @-@ plat@@ former support is distributed to more than a dozen other Can@@ did@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump ear@@ ns the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has ahead Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters support the plat@@ former , say they have firmly established their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with b@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago called immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; rape &quot; , &quot; the immigration turning point and fishing spot in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ si@@ veness of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Repub@@ lican party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with b@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounted for about half of the support of Repub@@ lican Elec@@ tors , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ ders than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also mad at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated about the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ bit Trail is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street one square meter of a roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro . &quot;
&quot; on Sylt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price seems to be as bad as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V@@ ölk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square met@@ ering prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well marked . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich , for example , is not at the top . &quot;
Champions League : awar@@ ding of Bavaria thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold Tor@@ cont@@ our in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have taken a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; in the Pir@@ äus &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won its kick @-@ off game in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and G@@ ötz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) deserves at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth offspring in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28th 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
&quot; on his 28th hit in the Champions League , Müller received a good co @-@ operation of Olympic champ@@ ions Roberto , who caused a gun@@ shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich maintained word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the top class , including against well known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams defeated , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went bol@@ dly , but often too resour@@ c@@ eful to work with their offen@@ sives . &quot;
the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa that rarely passed through former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner .
in the 6@@ 7. minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , when Olympic Games Stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown suggested the head@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct line , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; even though the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could put con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
&quot; on Tor@@ ic@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was abandoned . &quot;
&quot; for example , when he directed a shot of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6. ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola ordered a qu@@ at@@ cher with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , returning to muscular problems in the Ka@@ der , was initially sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero did not only give green light after the final training , said Sport@@ s@@ ist Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; during the first change , Guardi@@ ola also decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the landed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 73 . ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still put on it . &quot;
&quot; before the game , it was at the stadium in Kra@@ w@@ alle . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of partly obsc@@ ured Bavaria fans in their audience block evi@@ dently had prov@@ oked the followers of host Pi@@ raeus having words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with striking sticks to the Munich trailer . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : when ren@@ oun@@ cing the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a clearly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely to the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; main causes of tooth decay are decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these par@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent inflamm@@ ations in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years for the endanger@@ ing back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , declared Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; said Chief Apostle H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking dimin@@ ishes the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health down to the age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on the remains of the late anti@@ quity
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard arche@@ ologists excav@@ ated the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered a specialist department for arche@@ ological heritage preservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists now have found five . &quot;
&quot; text documents have already been known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman died at the station in the &quot; &quot; Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern &quot; , &quot; the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 am , the woman crossed the train station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , it carried out serious injuries , according to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated as a doctor on the spot and brought to hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
&quot; on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly cross @-@ crossing of the young woman , the intermedi@@ ary function@@ aries do not present any evidence . &quot;
the incident was possibly witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard of acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; there are residents or pass@@ ers by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Zi@@ egel@@ b@@ ä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot;

s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way works clearly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de presented the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
the TTIP is to develop the world &apos;s largest free trade area with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely envis@@ aged that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against judgement .
&quot; until now , the proceedings took place among each other on the refer@@ ee , a objection to their jud@@ gements was not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment course . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded especially large corporations to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism by which companies can dispute the damages of tax@@ pay@@ ers , bul@@ bs national laws , or to en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act reported the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
the Commission was considering important points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economics wrote Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic potential of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this , it was called . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) TTIP can be concluded , the discussions continued on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer sustainable .
Del@@ ik@@ ater folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy Fol@@ ks@@ aler has filmed the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captiv@@ ated by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells of various places he repeatedly draws on the map , about what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delicate songs tell . &quot;
&quot; where they originated and how it looks , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative mad@@ man . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; cle@@ ver@@ ly composed songs , harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , can always drift into great opul@@ ent style . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a van@@ ished series : each of the 50 states should follow in a row . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; has already appeared in 2004 and near the Rhine . &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The &quot; oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a nationwide acclaimed masterpiece . &quot;
over@@ due to ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in no list of songs from the influential music media .
&quot; following extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic attachments . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still being broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; since the smaller clubs , the stage shows become the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ rib@@ bons and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co . &quot;
&quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band . &quot;
in the dark @-@ held Hamburger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2000 guests now sit in their chairs now , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens comes back to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ened album . &quot;
&quot; one can hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can basically disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; plate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only after an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens writes hum@@ bly , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister Fra@@ ik@@ es
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Prime Minister Fra@@ ik@@ es . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s conc@@ ession and for the first time set up with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six questions shortly after noon , with his performance prob@@ able from the media prob@@ able and the Labour MEPs from the vicinity . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday .
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to ins@@ ist on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several cover page stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention , &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; &quot; independent &quot; &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they rely on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limit in profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour changes present to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister , said that the Party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo hold is too con@@ front@@ ational , and that he has both &quot; &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ality &quot; &quot; and the dispute with bar@@ b@@ arians and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle that the shadow economic minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also wrote the idea that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told Cameron that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater . &quot; but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first sent on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire with the Prime Minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the shelter and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needs far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds grows through accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; in parallel with this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller building target . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK rose by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage was the fastest and brought assessments on the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v was entered .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore climbed by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the stock of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had his estimate for the company Rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
JD Sports increased by 3.1 % after the Sport@@ swear Company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the CEO of JD Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labor costs for his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ poster brings Lebanese to potato @-@ twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or woo@@ fers ?
&quot; both - and indeed in the potato @-@ driver , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger pond keeper Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida rally with the inscription &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop , a barbecue sp@@ it , which is stock@@ ed with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been submitted to the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
Al@@ h@@ ay therefore doesn &apos;t want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches ground combat campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A branches in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash started to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A shops and sell shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell approved tickets to the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investment strategy day . &quot;
it is much in the game because South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shops and generate higher margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market for twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that IG@@ A @-@ retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fix@@ ture costs could cost around 13 million dollar profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash grows market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey of Roy Morgan finds that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will drop sales in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to openly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , while revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , food and food trade , which supplies approximately 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has been dropped by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , pays for itself and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compare sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and deliver IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs can be set to vig@@ or , and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ i and deserves praise for his own behaviour , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the lim@@ el@@ ight by the in@@ famous discussion of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , saying : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp broke out a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was defended . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the United Kingdom . &quot;
&quot; one thing I am rather proud of is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little drawn into the argument , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost a r@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he goes into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z in the crucial preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra , as a long @-@ term permanent part to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I think it is appropriate for the team and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency situation , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency situation and re@@ marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and besieg@@ ed ser@@ bian officials with indign@@ ation .
&quot; the people , who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown period in a land stri@@ pe on the road between the two control points of the countries and erected tents and settled down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations grew .
&quot; as a helicopter ho@@ ver over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some reject food and water from protest .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries have to take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached no common immigration policy one day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hopes that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would have reached that the EU states would receive more 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria asked for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to tackle the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has finished a fence along the Serbian border .
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were used in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are in search of a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view which is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into effect at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence constructed by the government along the southern border with Serbia . these laws also establish higher sentences for convic@@ ted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press repor@@ ters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already gotten deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
on Tuesday morning Hungarian civil servants also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
&quot; chaos envel@@ op@@ ed the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to enter . &quot;
&quot; about 20 people were able to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they arrive in Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton will continue to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he channel for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned a number of profits . &quot;
Clinton has a major advance in women and moder@@ ates but these projections have decreased .
&quot; your support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s benefit in democratic voters under 50 years has become volati@@ le , and they and s@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was with a double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the elections declare that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supp@@ orter also men@@ tions her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the sel@@ ect@@ ability are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ di@@ de for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders will increase from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the vot@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the voters of the elections is unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important tra@@ its in voters of the pres@@ election of their party .
&quot; maj@@ esty sees Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an out@@ sider , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say they have not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , whereas only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters altogether : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of eligible voters don &apos;t hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible voters see more than not hon@@ estly and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes under guidance . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut off best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son advances in nationwide survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters support the two candidates in the new survey , and others lose grip dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Repub@@ lican voters continue to support plat@@ former in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the Tuesday survey . &quot;
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received in demographic groups and sur@@ rendered g@@ ump with repub@@ lican constitu@@ ents with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ uns , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who dropped by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Repub@@ lican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week indicates that Car@@ son is entering the surveys - he lands at 19 % support with Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post also featured b@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ ups for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tr@@ umps . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea may be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; the water in the North and Baltic Sea in the Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) is dividing up to a maximum of 18 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch &apos;s College
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ ven@@ ous ritual than a student relationship in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people will be submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , distributed the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ si Brotherhood not called on the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and supposedly expected an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms to goo@@ geln and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide their utensils and set the br@@ otherhood of the Brotherhood in principle about the &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g &quot; , &quot; said Poli@@ ester Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with a mu@@ te force . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood . at least one student died of the chic@@ ane since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe received an indictment for Mor@@ des third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood - including Mr Men@@ g - are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or officially - has sanc@@ tioned , so we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local assembly . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; a debt of interest comes , and the land@@ se is thrown into the bank , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on how to proceed . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could however find that the excitement was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of a zinc increase . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level , to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some sectors of the economy might react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , anticip@@ ation of interest payments can volati@@ le things for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets may be stran@@ gled from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study about what happened after interest increases of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return for Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the raising cycle and the return on it begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote it .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the F@@ ed interest increase .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , nominal GDP has been only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 per cent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants all year were prepared for a Zin@@ c increase of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the elev@@ ations of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and above rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights were placed very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has so far been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le because the market anticip@@ ates a debt increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
&quot; at the end of the raising cycle , the bond yields are immediately falling , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s strateg@@ ists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a curve of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better income in such a climate even though &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy . &quot;
&quot; large and large companies will benefit from the greater part of their business activities in the United States , benef@@ iting from continuing interest rates and becoming more attractive local products . &quot;
multination@@ als with high debt are getting worse since an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts as well .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positive three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yield as well as low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by aver@@ aging 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock markets , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are how quickly that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for &quot; &quot; de@@ duction &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards and said that they just im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , claiming a leading Member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ c@@ aster to prove that he does something that the private stations do not do . &quot;
&quot; conserv@@ atives MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishes from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously @-@ called examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC general director dism@@ issed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and inform@@ ing the public .
&quot; what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music which is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on order , I really think of importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that har@@ sh@@ ly worked to engage audiences as it did so in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports was put under fire to get the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed The Voice - the BBC musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media at an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC fashion .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; , &quot; when it is the next time an entertainment series star@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the ühr@@ enz@@ ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the record began in 2000 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; for more than a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August showed the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider growth rates for years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developing over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales complex to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; it meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers increased around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers sites over@@ threw . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of £ 5 out of £ 1 was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now being carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims at the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia weak@@ ens the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed as a crane at Mec@@ ca Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to pay off their respect when the first of the dead did their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ vies cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the mour@@ ning proc@@ ession passed on to the holy place , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi King over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that left also 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beds killed when a crane fell by the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage while the crane had been over@@ powered . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already firmly agreed that the H@@ add@@ sch goes to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city , continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group , said , would not have let the arm of the crane stand as he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was jointly responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was forbidden to travel abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed to an inner courtyard of the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
&quot; for decades , the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family and takes over larger building projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was dispos@@ ed of by the family in 1990 . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
&quot; government officials admitted that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
&quot; British employ more and more craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has increased
&quot; this leads to the opening of 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are intended for tra@@ des@@ people &quot;
simultaneously close to King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that Britain put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European handic@@ raf@@ ts@@ men , who carry out the work in their home &quot;
&quot; if you sk@@ ill@@ fully handle a hammer or brush for painting walls , you now seem to be a minority . &quot;
&quot; the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to do do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers jobs in their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the tree @-@ market chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher intends to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are dedicated to tra@@ des@@ men and close to 60 outlets of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buy decisions in the store are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , who do more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British leader in FT@@ SE@@ 100 , has also structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and finance . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher gave a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian Volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and task attraction on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants were able to disp@@ ose mon@@ eys from the association accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; with some 400@@ ,000 euros the damage is eff@@ ected . &quot;
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial crime .
&quot; this fact was divided by the chair of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense was that the association was at no time an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials had only charged extra compensation and the Sport@@ club , for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money , the liabilities transferred to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we were standing before the situation : do we carry the club further or do we lock ? , &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told , in the bread profession major audi@@ tor of the financial department . &quot;
&quot; with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he decided to take over this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money to lay down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said at the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to pay debts . &quot;
&quot; in case of a corresponding financial success , the payout of the reimbur@@ sement of expenses was decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a part of the compensation claims were paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , pau@@ lins and non @-@ detailed accounts also appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us administered the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail by the association , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for the financial b@@ ail@@ out , it was important that only the freedom of debt had been , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as early as 2011 , an amount of 120,000 Euro was transferred to the club account . &quot;
&quot; that were set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants stated . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and was not known to the association according to his statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
wher@@ eup@@ on the respon@@ dent did not know an answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said finally , he believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room . &quot;
&quot; the defend@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified herself . &quot;
this transfer was form@@ alized as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity claims judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
&quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association was never damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; he said the function , he never referred a cent salary , he just calculated the mil@@ eage and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he added 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants could not submit accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer kept up after a run @-@ up in which everything had been judged correctly , they explained . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all dwell@@ ings are in cash , and from his place of residence he had to go to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard supports another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to staff cuts operating for three years , the computer giant will reduce additional jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the positions in the US computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) will not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a special strain of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed around 300,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Share was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the group of printers brought with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto is currently spl@@ itting up : in this way , the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a re @-@ dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate clients based on its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
&quot; in the third quarter of the fiscal year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late re@@ acted that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and always do business online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan envis@@ ages the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence against Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has deployed in the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and floo@@ d@@ light against several hundred open refugees .
&quot; Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent , D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k , has witnessed the breach of violence at the point of border control . &quot;
he reported phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind the police a police line was formed and there was a floo@@ d@@ light behind the police officers .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles after the officials . &quot;
the officials initially used continuous pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn somewhat from time to time .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who breath@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees sl@@ apped together and suffered under air@@ difficulty .
the spokes@@ persons of the Ser@@ b police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US emergency bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest has been raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists survey@@ ed by Reuters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and will hold interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest put on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank could possibly leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , head @-@ worker at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; she warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 PM CET on Thursday
death squ@@ ad at the Delta State University post@@ ulated debt cancellation
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississi@@ ppi , on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; during the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could make it happen &quot; , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississi@@ ppi , said that lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , I have shot someone and someone killed . &quot;
he told the staff of the emergency call centre that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , which &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be upset . &quot;
&quot; the police questioned the call@@ ers by his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police came into the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot;
&quot; University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , officials said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said she was married about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , who was 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that he called up relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , he drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , he received a PhD from the Delta State University , such as his lifetime on the website of the University . &quot;

all this certainly demands its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa @-@ Group aims to save a half billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
meanwhile there are new negotiations with the pilot &apos;s union .
&quot; in addition , Lufthansa is expanding its structure and evaluating low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa will not be responsible for the passenger operations in the future . &quot;
the low cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; in the executive board team headed by Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , will be responsible for the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the new positioning , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120,000 staff was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective agreement with the cock@@ pit pil@@ pit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the court stopped this Thursday . &quot;
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots .
&quot; in a year with a predicted record result , the cock@@ pit wants to come to viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; Wings &quot; concept is provided . &quot;
&quot; it shows , that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors stretches over the Group &apos;s own Bil@@ li@@ l@@ line Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven . &quot;
&quot; while this brought to the left defense def@@ ender and won him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al hopes that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was lost in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double be@@ acon and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic plays , and then this happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mexican person . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws Account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
related posts : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the England def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he &apos;s very difficult , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very bad violation , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the road in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a f@@ oul@@ ter by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you get to know it almost . &quot;
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead rec@@ alls a summary of the 2012 movie edition , adding new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city of th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to see a real tree , &quot; &quot; reads one . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Herz@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is sometimes read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted is hoping to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named young , like the local environment , hears , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a sitting , fier@@ y creature named in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s electoral bure@@ au .
&quot; while Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ son &apos;s staff , there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from the UK team but it is still difficult
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der , whom England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in bat@@ ting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that te@@ ck@@ ers are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully suggests further acquisitions for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not get such good performance and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
&quot; the question , how much time a test perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist gets to set his character is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first sat Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales came in , and he is a drummer , whom I highly appreciate . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must at least have the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat mos@@ ques apart from Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and got four qu@@ icks , emerged , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t strike there , and this lef@@ tist has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s guy from Cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ que might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first Drop before he kick@@ ed off in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
&quot; he made three hundred deer away , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he was very impressed by me as a young man . &quot;
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there is no great number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ches of the game that will bring a wealth of experience since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful commitment to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the aforementioned said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ is &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team offices do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in mind .

&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister to go on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European boy@@ friend , who wants an outside Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for it , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long periods such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ zz@@ ling power .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not inten@@ tionally plan some helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , presum@@ ing my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a &quot; &quot; P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sten who has made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Stra@@ ight ban@@ ana &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ ies . &quot;
&quot; with all his mad@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vill@@ ains , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who most of our large newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; actually , Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but noticed that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better spread ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ ms , because Bl@@ air had refused the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened his door to him . &quot;
the press has never for@@ s@@ aken it .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no more time to waste me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of 80 @-@ th years , a mistake then and now . &quot;
&quot; it may take but he must develop coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I press it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Ten@@ den@@ cy and the wild favor of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs had fought in him , do not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ th years when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and MPs after all reports on their sti@@ pulation on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottle @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a Brut@@ stätte of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron any free map for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ral campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ation economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction by the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of what was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health Report report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Statement &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month kick@@ ed off the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi@@ disciplinary decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to make their opinions about the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine content products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco remedy ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the BA@@ T testim@@ onials on public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that funds received from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports from tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the meeting .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote the research work of the group &quot; identifying &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence &quot; for the damages of most products .
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence yet that &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; were premature . &quot;
&quot; Prof. Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have been re@@ acted in advance . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people die every year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking does cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by defining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should be used only to make the type of programs sent not by other UK transm@@ itters .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from transm@@ itters like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least focus your production on programs that others don &apos;t do or order . &quot;
they send The Voice to a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I am tired of seeing how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ enders were to sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure quite the audience , but they can argue that if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion £ Broad@@ casting charges , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot;
&quot; of course , we all think that you get a great value for $ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for $ 150 per year , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ liner and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check out their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , make and maintain their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of this in &quot; inform@@ ing , clari@@ fying and talking about the publicly @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of part@@ n@@ ering said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and to make alliances with commercial Sen@@ ders to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms using gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human ear to be heard .
&quot; impulses work by switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane @-@ channels , which respond to ultrasound waves . &quot;
more on this topic : read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; fil@@ ament@@ ous worms usually do not react to ultrasound but Chal@@ as@@ ani noticed that they did , if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the reinforced ultrasound waves affect structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels , and found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such as Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified the worms so that some of their tril@@ onic teleph@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when ultr@@ asonic oscill@@ ates on the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bl@@ asts and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light which has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic @-@ waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily due to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are to be seen at bus stations and the subway trains and that require a second look . &quot;
&quot; important announcement : from September 15th to 18th with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line that trans@@ forms into the image of a tank . &quot;

the 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum für Cru@@ ci@@ bly Design in Bank &apos;s Dis@@ mal@@ and .
&quot; a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ -@@ pack of Allen keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one third of bus stations on the planet is gaining . &quot;

many artists participate in protests within protest movements and notice that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms posters sal@@ utes the comm@@ uter in the subway .
&quot; the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , who works as a non @-@ profit organisation with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist who works for free . &quot;
&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapons trade fair - through a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic company advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ stering of bright colours and animation it remains more lively . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a stepping up of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons trade show comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors can shi@@ ver fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ table 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in belief in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those who I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces extends from slightly nerve w@@ reck@@ ing up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ un@@ ce : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you have sab@@ bat@@ age , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ AH@@ A , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you find out people who like you like in contrast to those with whom you would not talk , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : don &apos;t think about getting to the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted received a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ stroll @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in cultivation allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant is exhausted by soci@@ ability - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; as you start the Uni at the height of forec@@ ast@@ le Man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I gave you something . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends close .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; poor@@ ly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
to steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the claw of chicken is a theft , but is it a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to operate themselves , even if they cook in the interior . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ ommate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb , you belong to the people sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours whether it was a matter to make them qui@@ eter , then three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded to it with even more loud music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly enter the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you keep a ro@@ ommate for your future marriage partner , go to her , go back and see her every day and perhaps witness how she transfers all common friends to himself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future marriage partner , at least try to give your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is f@@ ading than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good fortune is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety , but don &apos;t ch@@ ew any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and put your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but t@@ ack your poss@@ essions on the ceiling not more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , low @-@ income earned &quot;
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds semi @-@ detached houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the self @-@ extrac@@ ting mother and the ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and build good and good even today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are crow@@ ding in the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor believes to know how quickly cheap housing can be created : he builds semi @-@ detached houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for the people remain in a great part here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terrac@@ ed house is the solution . &quot;
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 3 ) 3,@@ 8@@ 64 6@@ 19 Happy Bir@@ th@@ day New@@ by ! ! ! &quot;
it makes integration easier .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of flats .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be rebuilt easily according to their needs .
how much are the costs ?
&quot; Gu@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is about 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; ( users View@@ ing this Forum : 3 ) 3,@@ 8@@ 64 6@@ 19 Happy Bir@@ th@@ day New@@ by ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the regulation of jobs . &quot;
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined who in a terrac@@ ed house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terrac@@ ed project ?
&quot; Gu@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but are you not exac@@ erb@@ ating the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gu@@ ano : it &apos;s true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments which can hardly afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need space . &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , typ@@ ing &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message telling you that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush comes back or try to update over iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely because of the encryption of the update . likewise , it will be easier to delete apps , and then re@@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to continue as the telephone may switch on half @-@ way and lead to a break @-@ out of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula One against his clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup Second stressed that I have nothing more to lose . &quot;

&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur . &quot;

Gau@@ sel@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation that President Alfred Klein accepted .
&quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players that cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ büro is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ isti@@ s Alten@@ ative Center joined the Social Foundation &apos;s man@@ tle and opened a new site at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; in addition to consultations , one can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the inner city .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new lodging office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health and nursing insurance . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; the new bud@@ get@@ ary Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital , as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Amadeus , &quot; explained the new bud@@ get@@ ary Jutta W@@ eig@@ and . &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the retirement center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are ideally supple@@ ment@@ ing .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the retirement center for care and care , &quot; said Heike R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ations of the inauguration , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the isolation at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ alising co @-@ operation . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

Vienna Archit@@ ect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ years passed away
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of the Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , like the artist &apos;s house on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the artist &apos;s house left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was stated in the report . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freel@@ ance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager . &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , he wishes to have invested 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years . &quot;

&quot; as a result , meadow kick@@ ed out of the shop , accused the civil servant and threw her the fake fine of money in front of the feet , as the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper reports . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; only after that , decide whether meadow will be displayed , or not . &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mu@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the altitude of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men cried out to the young , and struck them with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al bone frac@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the r@@ ack@@ et , he initially dism@@ issed the victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was now brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator persec@@ uted the group with a car up to their home and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when one didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
&quot; under the help of a striking stick , one examined the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
&quot; to date , only one v@@ ague report description is available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second r@@ ack@@ et should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen .
&quot; also , Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there , Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice of rock breaks on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing at half a position in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller will open the practice again on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the rock @-@ standing outside of years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll got to know who is currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and who also wants to enter into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I just inv@@ oked her . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old m@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with practice .
meanwhile they will continue to live in frac@@ tal @-@ Vil@@ sen@@ hausen .
&quot; there , the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices , as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he is a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed senior medical specialist in Di@@ ep@@ holz GmbH and volunte@@ ered to work in the DRC @-@ willingness to work on fr@@ enz@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ gen@@ ausen is a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) has specialised in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
after the reconstruction the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ related EK@@ Gs and need a consultation room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ P is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 euros will receive the land@@ fill in the framework of a funding program from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ t@@ citizenship Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2,000 patients each quarter results in the practice of rock breaks , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
&quot; in A@@ sen@@ dorf , there is another home practice practice . &quot;
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel ri@@ gh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if there was no successor , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; by the way , who visits Miller &apos;s spokes@@ man , also looks after all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms of the rock . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel ri@@ gh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; after the long time , a little sad@@ ness se@@ duc@@ ed her . &quot;
&quot; but we stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients can still see many patients often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds , &quot; We have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pressed myself from gardening . now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels gladly . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving refugees
&quot; now border controls are also going up at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum application can do so &quot; naturally . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people have to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia har@@ bors &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would like to continue travelling to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and , under certain circumstances , also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as a border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to kill his borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried during the night hours to Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles are constantly meeting new refugees in the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is predominantly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with some 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were led by the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , headed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it was called . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day additional buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had been travelling all night from the approximately 500 kilometres distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said to us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could actually lead to a predicted shift of the previous Balkan region Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ western route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations . &quot;
&quot; he did not refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; extensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you carry out rig@@ orous checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country as regards the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to continue travelling to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; Wednesday morning , Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was still trying to calm down on a local newspaper in Hor@@ gos : he pre@@ fers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not currently be a very high number of refugees .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private hung@@ arian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps showing alternative routes in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians expect to pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which is accused of having gained an insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information carried out , insi@@ der trading is said to have been made in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators reported a total of more than 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be tr@@ apped , &quot; says the SE@@ C . &quot;
the processes against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case lasted .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are supposed to have acted out both in the US and Eastern Europe .

&quot; puls@@ ating , spr@@ inkl@@ ing life at glorious autumn sun , and in the middle of four large boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die .... &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice help drew attention to its twenty @-@ year existence and is quite often confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the leader of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice help is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers .
&quot; while some of the passages spontane@@ ously grab@@ bed to the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; the sentence &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Read the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long suffer &quot; , &quot; others stay short , say sentences like &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , little discussion about the action is developing on the edge , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that for me some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian plant in Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband der E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , the fact that not everyone wants to publicly disclose itself on the tablets , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the fact that people are opening up . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ def@@ ro@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ant in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ and@@ roid can deal well with her job and the experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ rior , consider it precious and value the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free of charge and sec@@ t@@ arian .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as further education and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning attend@@ ants .
training for new employees will be offered every two years .
&quot; the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;

&quot; in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 per cent in the body transport segment , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenue because of higher prices , while earnings sank due to higher labor costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex share dropped by 3.@@ 85 USD , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strateg@@ ist spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the cor@@ p@@ se for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story sitting hall there is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from the congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed Represent@@ ative anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only about a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what sec@@ ures itself the financial market .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a raise interest rate this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets , however , expect fin@@ es of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising a further increase far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ sky , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a zinc increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August was slow@@ ing down , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly running under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered somewhat this month , but the Dow is now almost 10 % below the market . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when one should increase the interest rate . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not have occurred , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ y , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included technically in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world &apos;s monetary authority . &quot;
the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , dissolved Tur@@ b@@ ulation around the globe . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , right @-@ wing member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to a raise interest rate , cited in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its lending rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognition effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; a year later , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives had revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the re@@ unification of 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the committee on the interest @-@ raising of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a zinc increase because the markets upset , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think it should hurry the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is commonly referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central stop and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;

&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shopping takes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you . &quot;
the food kitchen ( good and cheap ) in this store is close to the coff@@ ees and has different take @-@ up options .

&quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome does not work without the commitment of countless volunteer workers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 lessons .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it in asylum seek@@ ers at the Dill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brasili@@ an pa@@ edi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to clear women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck in breasts that are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar panels .
&quot; the planning for the long @-@ longed for gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Bern@@ ese Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent community council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the committee decided not to apply for a legal &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the applicable cultivation plan . &quot;
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form in relation to the roof construction .
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof over@@ lay &quot; &quot; should be established . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; in turn was about the a@@ version prescribed for energetic reasons - different from the construction plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan regarding the roof incl@@ ination does not permit any &quot; exceptions , &quot; with the Bern@@ ese Municipal Council generally more restri@@ ctive in the case of liber@@ ating applications . &quot;
&quot; but this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at cost , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
supplements are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
&quot; in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre hall will now be presented to the State Council for testing . &quot;
clinic Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees will be working at the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital . &quot;
the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the continuing inland station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed about their plans .
&quot; the change has caused the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the Internal Station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer will be appointed with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees , both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ el , which has more than 35 beds , should finally be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the current restructuring at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed . &quot;
&quot; the Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal scar@@ city , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what I say . &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psych@@ iat@@ ric . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi proc@@ ession to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Löwen are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the complain@@ ant leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear choice in Wuppertal , but there is no reason to be arro@@ gant . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the B@@ HC gained a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and made a bit of splash there . &quot;
hunting accident with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Witt@@ enberg district ) , several h@@ unters were in action , as the police rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; after a gun lev@@ y , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
how exactly it could happen to the accident was unclear at first .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department )
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crime
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
&quot; in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that young@@ sters were killed and their bodies thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police arrived on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who , according to the statement , was reported to be a suspect and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after they did not come home after attending an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ees were admitted to the police , who killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and laid the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be introduced to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a stop to him . &quot;
the decision on the near@@ er circumstances of the act is to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution conflicts in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social Housing Construction .
&quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; thus , 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is making a deficit in front of itself , which will grow from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently some 77@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings were missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , said Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; therefore , many people with a job lived in big cities , in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
&quot; young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly staying at the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; for the F@@ lau@@ te on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; Alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
&quot; in this way , the property tax would be abandoned and the properties for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options are needed according to the association . &quot;
the programme for refugees of the Kf@@ W refugee shel@@ ters is now well received by towns and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 184 million euros . &quot;
now the project could be even increased .
refugees have free success : Croatia and Slovenia direct cor@@ rid@@ ors
&quot; after Hungary , practically no breakthrough exists , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb has termin@@ ated the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous nevertheless . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the isolation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to go from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV station RT@@ L reports . &quot;
Hungary had closed its border with refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to leave refugees .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic added : &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this eventu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees don &apos;t come across borders . &quot;
&quot; for this , the borders mark other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; in Hungary , however , after the close @-@ up of the border , there are hardly any more refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 registered people .
shortly before the end of the settlement on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws are committed to overcoming and damaging the bor@@ der@@ land as a criminal off@@ ense .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the condemned sentences of sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit zones &quot; , &quot; of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicant are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there would have been 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , virtually no one has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deport@@ ed there .
only a few hundred refugees were gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers begin to clean up . &quot;
they collected garbage that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
lock gr@@ illes were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps at the border town was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government information . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the journey to Germany . &quot;
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on a regular basis . &quot;
mayor continued &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy at the end of the bridge on Sunday with the clean @-@ up , when ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly set up railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ ured the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into Nah@@ e Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we had the unexpected guests sh@@ ou@@ ted , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said immediately , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels , the str@@ anded train passengers were switched to a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au to try it after the short notice that railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try over the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was put off before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
&quot; the bridge @-@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , day before a two @-@ bridge race spor@@ ti@@ ly - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further Z@@ ig@@ rad to us is a logical result of an impressive policy :
&quot; instead of helping the camp to help build structures that ensure humanity , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor has officially inaugurated the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the poultry will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a major challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter , with us to make decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria uph@@ eld . &quot;
Konrad looking for 3@@ 5.000 people in winter@@ time
Konrad has all the hands to do with the Refu@@ gee movement .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen banks to place lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the former shooting centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the placing of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also without great vor@@ tices , &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , however , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ crisis situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 districts throughout the year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the Gover@@ nor , he has already held talks . &quot;
&quot; they would have assured him , also to create lod@@ gings for the upcoming refugees . &quot;
&quot; it works well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also calls for big expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping As We &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of times it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers have to hold a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the so@@ ber .
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he was more successful in accommodation , Konrad proved his experience . &quot;
I am an older gentle@@ man whom you do not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
belief power is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic any costs as they explained .
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
&quot; until now , your own quest for accommodation has not been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
the city of Linz is not planning an opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees .
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , because the persons affected are currently under negotiation without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for its suit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are profiles of leading retailers , with analysis of their performance and the challenges they face . &quot;
other districts have to make their contribution here too .
&quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) took action on Monday for further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees in Germany .
the addi@@ cts would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger called on more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria once again carries out controls on its borders , is &quot; a logical sequence &quot; from the actions of the Germans for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line has officially been completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT group S &amp; T moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and later also acquire them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T plans to cooperate with the new neighbours - which is what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building has been le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of rest area in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there will be requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin inaugurated second shop in the arcade
fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : after all , she has now acquired growth in the form of a further business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the shop , in which they are sold among other bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories costs up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long wondered if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things that the Vene@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Linz Europe that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten Br@@ eit from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I love most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag into rap@@ ture , the expert &apos;s wife can not answer with the last security . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the bread @-@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself in a foreign language , as regards journalists , or reveals gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts well on it .
&quot; this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real @-@ life billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
&quot; the New Yorker , with the hair @-@ dryer , is a concept many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine road . &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related over -@@ zig ver@@ tices with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) , Tr@@ ump , who is not known for hum@@ ility , also comes to words - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; for the king of the hearts , he has not brought it there . &quot;
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , it tends to say that &quot; &quot; ump &quot; &quot; is a little b@@ ump@@ y , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , says it . &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation of the real estate company was the first real estate in New York .
&quot; however , the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Folklore , Roland Paul , had declared film @-@ start . &quot;
&quot; ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes prominent statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly spoke to Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to fri@@ ghten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the polar bears , this is not so lik@@ eable , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tri@@ b@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; Pen@@ sion@@ vor@@ tin Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , men@@ tions that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he doesn &apos;t win the election because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sag@@ as at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Peter Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , which has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ at@@ chers , also in the United States the interest awak@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; the Upper Bavaria municipality Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; villages . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;

&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews of Today . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the Resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 viewers in the five main cities compared with Today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today has closed the gap to the Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August , Today , Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far , in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning men more than the parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently dec@@ eived father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could play a hit show solo without Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 p.m. to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , was an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 visitors and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half an hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute it didn &apos;t manage to sur@@ pass the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery is un@@ covered ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may seem un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly evi@@ dently who wins The Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you possibly acci@@ dentally gave an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips ti@@ ghtly sealed to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ rical fashion , why wood is the perfect man and recognized his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? , &quot; could their answers to the game per@@ ver@@ ick , who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly recognized both themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; The One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously wasn &apos;t just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly hired for him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost an angel as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ Liga @-@ Conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers sports repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian favour were hoping for his N@@ FL dé@@ but . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the field after F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one cares only about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot;

the Free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; party and faction leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria schools before a serious crisis in Bavaria schools , if there were not correspon@@ d@@ ingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get dis@@ courses in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the State Day fraction of the Free @-@ elec@@ tors is postpon@@ ed until Friday in the Francon@@ ian Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the Free elec@@ torate meetings .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lay the retreat &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free V@@ ote boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers wish to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; for this reason , Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ CEO critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need standardis@@ ed federal standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more action @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the country &apos;s politics should not fall under the table in big wall@@ ets . &quot;
a long standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Education , Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) , started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe &quot; &quot; with an extension of the secondary school grade of three to four years . &quot;
but that &apos;s not far enough Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools that want to do so .
free travel to the G@@ 9 wherever desired .

&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recorded some 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to take place until after the interest decisions in the US and also for the great decline on the stock exchange on this Friday .
the discussion about the bur@@ dens arising from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and also left deep traces in E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;

&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired up rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ leng@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , chief executive officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , with some of them threw stones and fire@@ bomb . &quot;
&quot; Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said , the police have used tear gas and fired into the air before re@@ covering to rubber bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , which are known to be able to kill , are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal on the southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ amm@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal dominated by the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent con@@ front@@ ations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legislature voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and living - concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter plot in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; the aim is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city . &quot;
which investor may be in@@ eligible is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property located on the street / corner Great Street , already bought some months ago and let the building slip on it . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plans for the holiday homes at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several tra@@ ilers are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure facility
&quot; months behind closed doors had been negotiated , gre@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday home in the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Council of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends in the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euros have been involved in the discussion for months .
&quot; fierce reactions among marine owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the tra@@ ilers , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ash that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; all bus loads must come so that this is worthwhile &quot; , &quot; said Mr Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the well @-@ established hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this l@@ acked , even the development plans are still variable . &quot;

twin @-@ bir@@ ths are rare with gor@@ illas .
&quot; the last in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967 , it is called by the Zoo . &quot;
&quot; the gender of the new@@ born gor@@ illa tw@@ ins is not yet established , since mother Di@@ an keeps her close to her body so far . &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ up campaign involving $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ations call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , escaped with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / refuge@@ em@@ el@@ ief could be doubled to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many flee from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
report by Yas@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight @-@ loss surgery , which wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb nutrition .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted with people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital had data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - on medical treatments for type 2 diabetes for people who were easily over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who did not @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes disorder was completely and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and &quot; bad L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood glucose level which reflects blood glucose levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish the mort@@ ality of five years , thus the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also resulted in average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ric acid group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.4 versus 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported more complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefits of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier persons in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because she says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is currently attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth for years and she falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so even in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put her birth@@ place a literary monument .
it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide asked to end the violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
&quot; the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long term solutions , such as genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of taking hand san@@ iti@@ zer through children over the past 4 years
&quot; tox@@ in control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ low alcoholic dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 were reported to report the toxic control centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
juven@@ iles have allegedly bl@@ ended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing m@@ outh@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for inf@@ ants , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison Centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year old girl , recently taken four sy@@ ringe barrels of sc@@ ented hand san@@ iti@@ zer in school , was brought to treatment in an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her concentration of blood was 179 , twice higher than the threshold imposed by an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah scann@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors supervised her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by alcohol and had kick@@ ed off her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tho@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing tra@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York were planning to poison their &quot; gem@@ m@@ ical &quot; teacher by placing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished it from her room .
&quot; the police regarded the ne@@ sted plan as a &quot; &quot; weapon &quot; &quot; and rejected discipl@@ ined measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; in a rear @-@ end coll@@ ision on the cross @-@ gap between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and on Her@@ bs , a 33 @-@ year driver has been easily injured during a catch @-@ up accident . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove towards the round@@ about in the direction of the branch of the industrial area and was too late to realize that two driving cars had stopped at the round@@ about .
&quot; as a result , he jump@@ ed into the rear of an audience with his lor@@ ry and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; the accident involved in accidents caused damage of some 10,000 euros , informs the police . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected spontane@@ ously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control since they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dr@@ illed Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at present , de Bo@@ er , an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show cli@@ ma@@ xes of Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not only talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .

there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm games and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; I will spin around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to reverse things . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now with five points lead clearly to the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times already , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly the way - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison@@ ous injection . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I voted because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , there will be a more mac@@ ab@@ ate lot@@ tery , in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is chosen , will observe it emotion@@ less . &quot;
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; could have been better formulated , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ mann , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I think that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters to whom you can turn to it .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to get out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt by a man from Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not get too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ se@@ c wasn &apos;t too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned on a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins went to the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , and threatened to finish the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , claiming that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he himself had found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ y test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I plan to say nothing about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes one re@@ acts and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to go around the head and I want my owners to think I &apos;m trying my best for them .
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; before , Moo@@ dy had sent the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart lived in a room with a man - whom I am called - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed to write me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should this take me to think that it will be personally ?
&quot; does the R@@ V@@ L act in a solem@@ n way , and maybe people outside coaches are responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and leave me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and press them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have developed with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt check@@ up near Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching introduced that he could &quot; throw &quot; his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which pushed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
&quot; it could have been the whole day , which was so . &quot;
but it was also so on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot;
man arrested after the driver &apos;s flight

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals due to claims of ring struggles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ire players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm win in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening allowed .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ cely concealed re@@ mark to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ kling of his team and said they were concentrating only on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kling .
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this happens again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles to a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to lose it so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this time and time again appears at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and remind his ment@@ or that the Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they probably didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot;
the Storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ Dep@@ o@@ sit on drug engagement &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong punishment due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a possibly li@@ vable penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs M@@ om and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars for security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ al declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he dism@@ is@@ ses his Australian and his Serbian passport , noti@@ fies himself by the police daily and agrees to a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab torn apart
&quot; during a coll@@ ision accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks took part in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver re@@ marked it too late , trying to avoid spending the last moment on the left , just like the police . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing accident torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to attract ped@@ oph@@ ile to transmitt@@ ing images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept , log@@ on to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of continuous pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl later wo@@ ke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and instantly al@@ erts her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and found &quot; &quot; related &quot; &quot; web research , used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; admitted to be a polic@@ eman in order to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction , that he is addic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches were done on the computer by him , but said it was happening because he wanted to asser@@ t a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and we@@ eping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and play@@ station used to talk to girls , who looked much younger than he . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on June 14 , last year , and not to appear before the court hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g was not appearing in the Register of Sex@@ ual offen@@ ders , because you could argue that &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual item &quot; &quot; may be found in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared judgment until October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many people from fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure increased the people to smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river river river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and st@@ ow@@ es to the German side .
&quot; there , they are received and passed on to the registration by Federal Police Offic@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the main station of Munich &apos;s main railway station , there were significantly more refugees after the week of the week , compared to the week of the week . &quot;
&quot; around 700 people had arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a speaker in the morning . &quot;
after the re @-@ establishment of inspec@@ tions at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : dro@@ pper of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of stor@@ ks in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low @-@ pressure area above Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low was the pi@@ per of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; who was drawn over the Atlantic over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot;
violent storms and storms are expected mostly in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , on Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the Lake Constance Circle with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IA@@ A .
&quot; in 2015 , movement in the compact cars is to be recorded , which is currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are currently in demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone in August alone , according to the German Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) . &quot;
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
the Opel Astra is one of the greatest premier@@ es for the German car industry in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not supposed to become much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel introduces a start @-@ up of the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , H@@ esse will offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be next to the Astra at the IA@@ A to new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ ented sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he will also be a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan tra@@ der wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully adapting to the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ litre tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s data .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
outside the designers of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed floo@@ d@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
&quot; most of all , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , a series of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the fresh@@ ened Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the Jus@@ tiz@@ um &apos;s enti@@ ary enti@@ ary , which was lod@@ ged for months in a too small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in too small cells . &quot;
this has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to those concerned , the judges may even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a residential space Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , has now been on a free foot , has been transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country Berlin failed .
but the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for re@@ viewing there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity violation .
the Court of Appe@@ als decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation are decisive for legal reasons , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; wor@@ sen@@ ing the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of joint damage .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; thus they only spoke of a prisoner of in@@ dem@@ nity in April , because he was locked up naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the multi @-@ assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing for a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel fall in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours in a homo@@ geneous cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have been in the head@@ lines because of missing personnel . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore locked up again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is increasing , even to fight , it should already have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information on the judicial authority , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of young people , 19 should be om@@ itted in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what is to be done in Germany ?
&quot; according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even capable of cap@@ turing a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we do that .
what comes from Germany gives the following overview .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 25@@ 0000 holiday apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing coinci@@ des with the rental price , and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Federal Minister for Building Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 Sozial@@ flats are to be created every year , and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , a project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Grab@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change in Germany : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a temporary ban on asylum seek@@ ers for up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residential duty to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the view has prev@@ ailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a large obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German language .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
research shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contact .
&quot; for this reason , the structure of networks is therefore the Königs@@ weg path for integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the deeply rooted parents it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zy@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the demand for educ@@ ators increase strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - e.g. by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German are prepared for classes . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin School of School . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal land prohi@@ bits asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , the Interior Minister Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance . &quot;
prepar@@ atory refugees could be made easier to access the university .
refugees with a residence permit or debt do not receive services after the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they start a study .
&quot; the latter , in principle , do not receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g because they do not fall under the circle of eligible persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely swe@@ ep into Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state church law to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization which will take care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also include obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to pres@@ ide on religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who refused such conflicts in Germany immediately expressed their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination work for a decade and a general gender equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it is slowly learning how the NS@@ U murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racial motive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , what international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany are demanding and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years , if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their options - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money has to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , to all newcom@@ ers , demands right at registration health cards . &quot;
provided services could be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated later with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er law prescri@@ bes . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the doctors do above all establish the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctors offices , interpre@@ ting costs should be taken over . &quot;
&quot; for many refugees , however , many refugees have also been involved in emergency ambul@@ ances with more general assistance centres . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; in the case of refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ affected disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; but with the partial other cases of disease , German doctors come from their education but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to detect . &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , even relief may even be in sight by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , several refugees even were doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and possibly again test examinations . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Federal Medical Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , declared Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee crisis is traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breathing difficulty , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleeping and concentration difficulties , severe shock and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms to be chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z stated . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill @-@ sick refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , but the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to attract all age groups under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to the Man@@ ege on the Bri@@ ck @-@ was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ an teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ at@@ erial stage .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
thus the gift for spiritu@@ alism lies in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old juni@@ or@@ orch@@ id . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ eg@@ enco@@ der tail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ gram C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to take up a loos@@ ely . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - in these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast will conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ aries , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger @-@ tip and joint . &quot;
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ humans fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
so the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or a 200 spect@@ ator , we always do our best and are with our whole heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September every day from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe positions false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats , and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot;
&quot; last month they had boo@@ sted him , and during his speech the State of the Nation was interrupted - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man for Democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s response .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &apos; Tod &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in the parliament ends , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is building up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing corporate hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reduction results in a load of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP leader and Chief Executive , guiding the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says a statement of the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electric systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to manage the traffic from traditional PC to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and as long as his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his history , his involvement in the next summer is still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season with a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
&quot; since his debut six years ago , the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases left by Wil@@ sh@@ ere . &quot;
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture of Arsen@@ al is that in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most injury stage . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career of the kind he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it to take a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although ar@@ sen@@ al are clear favor@@ ites to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched last season .
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , measured on the Richter scale 3.8 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by far hope to lead the association to his first European ap@@ o@@ calyp@@ tic triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show which gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men who need help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to master this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it even though they often hold back to explore their feelings completely . &quot;
&quot; as a employee of the telephone conversations , I explained : ... &quot; My role role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised , has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term pain management mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone will also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you attend the weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; di Maria strikes to help PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ mund Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League , di Maria strikes on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ bu@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the track , but after that she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised its lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball@@ ast in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Shak@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against Swedish master because they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfection in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury to the Paris team , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 un@@ deci@@ de@@ dly at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian flu@@ gel@@ er was called the man to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he passed in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Hun@@ ed@@ o@@ ara defense , before he finished in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , hitting the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ app posts in the 3@@ 4. minute , they offered little to attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ ć , which was scrat@@ ched in the first half alone and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he put his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which was turned by Di Maria in a shooting , which was led by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low until substitute player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognized a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norweg@@ ians said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification @-@ games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales

&quot; the company , which has lost 57 per cent of its market value in this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices since China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
&quot; in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of subscription rights provided a rapid rise to the top of London Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; last week , Gl@@ enc@@ ore announced $ 2.5 billion of stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut around a third of its 30 billion dollar debt . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .

white House confirms Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , xis first official in Washington , takes place on September 25 and res@@ ists President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will be host to Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state D@@ iner , after the two leaders have bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President xis visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi can give the possibility to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders on its way to Washington before heading to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi addressed a number of disputed issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged Cyber@@ sp@@ on@@ age China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi who played for FC Barcelona a few years ago .
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three time champion champion , four time champion league winners , two times champion Champions , twice European champion , twice world champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was already before the European Tour before the farewell from Barcelona . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know , &quot; he says . &quot;
and this also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in memory : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
&quot; however , the change did not happen . &quot;
and the crucial man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken guar@@ dians under contract and I have played a great EM . &quot;
PE@@ P said to me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns playing time 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , split the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the ultimate class triumph at the end . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film production
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the African filmm@@ aker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ Light , experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen screen@@ play . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , do it at the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian prof@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers , Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the character of Harmony , &quot; Brown said first . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ lin@@ t , beaten by her white nec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People nominated for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing @-@ rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction , &quot; &quot; at the end , could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip , wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain her variety - that &apos;s SO NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned over 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Matter contained nationwide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to command discri@@ min@@ atory practices against the ab@@ ov@@ emen@@ tioned contents . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Matter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of Fox News @-@ Person@@ ality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Matter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already made the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which had just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Camero@@ oni@@ ans Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , up to the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope included in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended up with the task within the time that he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him vic@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the great rati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
he received a number of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be sm@@ itten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac would have felt just the same , if they had exchanged the roles . &quot;
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior has been extended for a season of season and the filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ way past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins inde@@ b@@ ted a chance to climb inside a half@@ way of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Em@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings 6 times and made three R@@ uns possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; Simon said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to enter fully into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first r@@ allies since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first thre@@ es@@ ome hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the heart@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( stroke training ) , saw clearly better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks achieved a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the lef@@ ty Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy went over the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed la@@ the Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run at the second , Ver@@ hagen scored the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
&quot; after det@@ ecting a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , Wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game from an even non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three ranks in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the game of the vulner@@ ability list after he was missing more than one month because of a cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch because in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , flus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
&quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended . &quot;
the tig@@ ers laid out in the second one One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat well , but he got the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before replacing A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter by the Reli@@ ever right handed . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder rig , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is stri@@ cken from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he was absent from the right hip joint since 20 August .
the tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in target field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees should be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people in charge will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
they calculated with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the state capital were prepared for this case in recent days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily perish . &quot;
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , the government pres@@ idency of G@@ ießen took 7@@ 500 people in Hessen . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria . &quot;
&quot; I believe the determined reflection on military action may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; collective departure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict is crashing before our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again implemented controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Home Affairs Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , did not return refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner , there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and Members of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete numbers and pointed out to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come from Hungary to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit for next week . &quot;
Germany had begun on Sunday with passing border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120,000 refugees next Tuesday ( September 22 ) at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial survey and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced in late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour discussions with Prime Ministers in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection are also comm@@ itting this . &quot;
but those who do not have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was group@@ ed extensively in the round .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now have a &quot; &quot; huge power effort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to told Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , on the other hand , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of further migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean s@@ ails .
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ son@@ de Cass@@ ini .
&quot; accordingly , the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its or@@ bit around the ring @-@ planets . &quot;
&quot; this exchange movement is only small , but nevertheless too large for a permanently fixed heavenly body , it is said in a statement from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
it was known for a longer time that there must be liquid water under the ice @-@ blanket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; thus , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered Ice vul@@ kan@@ e at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers joined at that time . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama lack 1860 Munich several weeks
&quot; the 1860 München must abst@@ ain from Off@@ ensive Val@@ det R@@ ama , for about a month . &quot;
an investigation has shown an ad@@ duction of ad@@ duction in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
R@@ ama was already compl@@ aining about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Leu@@ ven , the diagnosis is &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of forced retirement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s hard , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to pon@@ der now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper looking at the possible obligation of a non @-@ union pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , however , the Six@@ ties first presented a de@@ fl@@ it@@ ant . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has the opportunity to demonstrate his ability . &quot;
door@@ h@@ unters Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian National Player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent coll@@ ision at the head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a weigh@@ ty blow . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
&quot; man@@ goes contain relatively large amounts of sugar , especially su@@ cro@@ se . &quot;
&quot; healthy are the exotic fruits anyway : in them B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when purchasing , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell . &quot;
&quot; the color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is , so even green man@@ goes can taste delicious . &quot;
they should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
a man@@ go also gives heart@@ y dishes a special touch .
it soften@@ es the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot;
&quot; the US parcel service U@@ PS will provide up to 95@@ 0,000 hel@@ pers for Christmas business in the USA . &quot;
&quot; the company started the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are sought . &quot;
&quot; already last year , U@@ PS had raised its workforce for the holiday season by 95@@ 0,000 hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex met for past year earlier arrangements to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , bel@@ ated shipments had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service . &quot;
&quot; first öh@@ n@@ sturm , then striking cold @-@ front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps of the Alps the F@@ öh@@ n breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday . &quot;
on wed@@ n@@ esday and on the night for th@@ urs@@ day the öh@@ n blows partly with storm force through the fo@@ ehn valleys .
&quot; on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings powerful rainf@@ alls , wind bu@@ cks and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current . &quot;
on the side of the Alps at night the fo@@ ehn breaks through the valleys .
&quot; as a result , the hair dryer until Thursday morning in the caves of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land , partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the fo@@ ehn can penetrate into the adjacent middle and in the mountains , and on the mountains there are even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my blow for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine slope . &quot;
rain stops here that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , with some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter , it must be calculated that large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow comes out , in the row a cold front rolls with powerful , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold @-@ front , the wind strongly fresh@@ ens up to stor@@ my , and temperatures rise sharply . &quot;
&quot; the following days can be found in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it gets sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Piazza San Lu@@ er@@ o , &quot; he is now honored as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible that their tradition of Christian faith was welcomed in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a comm@@ itting sin b@@ abel .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther therefore initiated the split of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his thes@@ es against the Ab@@ las@@ h@@ el .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated the Bible text .
at the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective topics can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles formed are devoted to themes such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; with this , he has spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is above all the author , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Scrip@@ tures based on painting . &quot;
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into contemporary contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original translation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist who puts his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant sovereign Order . &quot;
&quot; the education took place sometimes with the cane floor , &quot; said Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work on this , in order to bring me to the Lord again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to bring art back to more importance in the quick@@ ening time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is characterised today by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being pushed aside .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to fall into the pictures , let them appear , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; old did not care not to capture the Bible completely , but also the most important , mysterious topics for him . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X
&quot; a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train , it was finished . &quot;
&quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ one , especially among residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway . &quot;
&quot; thus hills depos@@ ited , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building license . &quot;
&quot; the permission will be made in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck is now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year can still be seen , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga uses a clear sign at the weekend . &quot;
football is responding to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in dealing with the problems that arise .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in principle nobody can say , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor .
&quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be policy .
&quot; the German soccer association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun @-@ Stiftung , we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 profil@@ ing shows a clear sign , if they are on the left tri@@ cot contest instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ ens Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler der &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama hits everybody , nobody must be able to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer federal li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our appeal , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was speaking of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
&quot; for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ sbach called the support of refugees as &quot; a big community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ enses had launched their own projects in their villages was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will each provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have called up all the money for 2015 , &quot; Nier@@ sbach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP executive manager loses sight of an accident at accident
&quot; the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood@@ less , impot@@ ent , got out of the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
it is important to get up again if you like .
NT@@ F @-@ C.@@ O.@@ N.@@ S. Head@@ master

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us versus Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally van@@ ished . &quot;
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its trunk 11 on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the gat@@ eke@@ eper &apos;s position .
&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master ke@@ epers Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europe league games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left it open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ bad statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final proc@@ ession for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has to be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l thinks comprehensible : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robot @-@ cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the German government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of cars . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together at the IA@@ A also with representatives from industry . &quot;
the Ministry of Transport strategic paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy switching to digital radio stations .
currently there is a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; in order to prevent the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government intends to examine the legal framework conditions and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Germany wants to campaign for example internationally that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention which has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; despite this , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S &amp; D MEP S@@ ören bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or American .

&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital association , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , the traffic in flowing traffic could produce 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would give the car the control under no circumstances .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , which , thanks to video projections , will look horri@@ bly human . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation from September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial attitude towards a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canada and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into this hardly survi@@ ving work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not structured , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ographer &apos;s complete art work for which much effort was taken : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , especially a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tonnes of material have er@@ ased the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outside with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d modi@@ fying temp@@ tations of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his ted@@ dy bear and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , but of course . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
&quot; they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ene top as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; in the past , it went on to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a great deal for customers , for example , for covering blan@@ kets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the desp@@ ised desp@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , and was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt named some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past sty@@ le@@ po@@ ets , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use niche in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
Mo@@ desp@@ ath Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
private specialty stores and also wholesale distribution do not exist any more .
our products reach the customer in this way hardly any more .
&quot; nowadays , the mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively by chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently to Russia and the United States . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer explains from the nitrogen chamber in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been conducting a quality seal , which shows that we produce organic and socially sustainable . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Exter@@ ne of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think especially economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ ls small ch@@ icks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s masterpiece Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ck was inspired : &quot; &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and the surrounding area and who would like to have a reminder . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still dar@@ ing to get a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about a re @-@ fil@@ ement , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic chil@@ dr@@ ens girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins over 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already firm : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; the economy must be open broad@@ ly to support growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group charged with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and advancing reform will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments . &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a far @-@ right business environment and designed the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen inspec@@ tions about the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open up state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their work , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; the meeting also attended Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang as well as important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Gu@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values of mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consume the consumer a much higher dose of the neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; the Food@@ watch consumer organisation , which has a corresponding paper paper from the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mer@@ cury , that approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed on the basis of the still valid limits . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU according to Food@@ watch wants to shar@@ pen limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; Food@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low stra@@ ined that they already hold the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ action manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf sch@@ midt . &quot;
mer@@ cury is a heavy metal poison@@ ous for the human being that is strongly enriched by the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; already small amounts of damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; can already be caused . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury is used primarily by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations come across more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; long @-@ lasting and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mer@@ cury in fish have already been among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ F . &quot;
