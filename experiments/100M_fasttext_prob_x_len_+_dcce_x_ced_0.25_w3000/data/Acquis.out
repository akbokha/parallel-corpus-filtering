&quot; ( 1 ) For goods transported in the TI@@ R process under customs union with road vehicles , lor@@ ries or containers , a complaint is generally not carried out in case of transit collap@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In order to prevent ab@@ uses , customs authorities can , however , in exceptional cases and in particular , if the suspic@@ ion of an in@@ consistency exists , to carry out a complaint of the goods during the passage of passage . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) Any contracting party may warrant against f@@ uses and under conditions stipul@@ ated by them , either by themselves or by the associations connected to them in connection with Car@@ nets TI@@ R and to take over the office . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The association is only allowed in a country if its office also extends to the liabilities arising in this country from goods transport with Car@@ nets TI@@ R , which have been issued by foreign associations , belonging to the same international organization as the so@@ othing association . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ net TI@@ R pre @-@ prints , which are sent to the br@@ anded associations of the foreign associations or by international organisations , are free of input and output as well as import and export restrictions and import and export restrictions . &quot;

&quot; the Br@@ inging Association shall be liable to the persons who owe the aforementioned amounts , as a whole @-@ deb@@ tor for the in@@ filtration of these amounts . &quot;
&quot; 2 . if the laws and other provisions of a contracting party do not intend to comply with the input or output charges in the cases referred to in paragraph 1 , the following association has to commit , under the same conditions a payment in the amount of input or output charges are attribut@@ able to any default interest . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) E@@ very contracting party sets out the amount of Ho@@ und , which may be required for each Car@@ net TI@@ R after parag@@ rap@@ hs 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) The liability of the bond to the authorities of the country , in which the customs office is located , begins when the Car@@ net TI@@ R has been adopted by the customs authority . &quot;
&quot; in other countries through which the goods are still being transported in the TI@@ R process , liability begins with the import of goods or with the acceptance of the Car@@ net TI@@ R by the customs office where the TI@@ R transport is resum@@ ed if it has been exposed in accordance with Article 26 parag@@ rap@@ hs 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The liability of the Br@@ inging Association does not only cover the goods listed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , but also on goods which are not listed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , but are located under customs union in part of the vehicle or a container ; it does not extend to other commodities . &quot;
( 6 ) The information contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R shall apply to the determination of the data mentioned in parag@@ rap@@ hs 1 and 2 until proof of the opposite part as correct .
&quot; ( 7 ) The competent authorities have to demand the amounts mentioned in parag@@ rap@@ hs 1 and 2 of the amounts mentioned in parag@@ rap@@ hs 1 and 2 , which they immediately owe , before the ex@@ propri@@ ation of these amounts shall be called upon . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The Federal Association determines the validity period of the Car@@ net TI@@ R and determines the last day of validity , after which Car@@ net cannot be submitted for acceptance . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) If the Car@@ net has been accepted by the customs office in accordance with paragraph 1 , at the latest , it remains valid until the end of the TI@@ R Tran@@ sports at the destination customs authority . &quot;
( 1 ) Car@@ net TI@@ R may be handled by reservation or without reservation ; reservations must be subject to facts concerning the TI@@ R transport itself .
&quot; ( 2 ) If the customs authorities of a country do a Car@@ net TI@@ R without reservation , they cannot demand the ex@@ propri@@ ation of the amounts mentioned in article 8 parag@@ rap@@ hs 1 and 2 , unless the agreement has been ab@@ usive or frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) If a Car@@ net TI@@ R has not been dealt with or subject to reservation , the responsible authorities can only demand the final approval of the amounts mentioned in Article 8 parag@@ rap@@ hs 1 and 2 , if they have notified the guarantee bond within one year following the acceptance of the Car@@ net TI@@ R by the customs authorities , the non @-@ liability or the reservation subject to reservation . &quot;
&quot; the same applies if the registration certificate has been ab@@ usive or frau@@ dul@@ ent , but in these cases the deadline is two years . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The so@@ lic@@ itation of the amounts mentioned in Article 8 parag@@ rap@@ hs 1 and 2 shall be addressed to the Federal Association at the earliest three months and at the latest two years after the date of notification to the association , that the Car@@ net has not been dealt with or frau@@ dul@@ ently or frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; however , within the specified period of two years the matter has been made to the subject of a judicial procedure , the payment for@@ estation must exp@@ ire within one year after the date the court decision has become final . &quot;
( 3 ) The Association has the required amounts to be paid within three months after the date of payment .
&quot; the amounts established will be reimbur@@ sed to the vou@@ ched band@@ age , if the customs authorities have been deemed satisfactory in the course of two years after the date of payment requests , that a lack of regul@@ arity has not been made in the case of transport . &quot;
&quot; the sections a ) and b ) apply only if each road vehicle with respect to its construction and equipment corresponds to the conditions specified in Anne@@ x 2 , and is approved according to the procedure specified in Anne@@ x 3 . &quot;
( 1 ) The sections a ) and b ) of this chapter only apply if the containers are built according to the conditions specified in Anne@@ x 7 Part I and are approved according to the procedures specified in Part II of the mentioned plant .

&quot; ( 1 ) Any contracting party reserves the right to recognize the approval of road vehicles or containers , which do not comply with the provisions of Articles 12 and 13 , not to be considered valid . &quot;
&quot; the contracting parties , however , will avoid delay in the carriage if the identified short@@ com@@ ings are of minor importance and no danger of sm@@ ug@@ gling . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Road @-@ vehicles or containers , which no longer comply with the conditions relevant for their approval , may only be used again for transport of goods under customs clearance when their original condition is restored or the vehicle has been re @-@ approved . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) For the temporary import of road vehicles , trucks or containers used for transportation in the TI@@ R process , no special customs document is required . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Parag@@ raph 1 does not prevent a contracting party , to demand that the identification unit envis@@ ages liability for domestic duties fores@@ een in order to ensure that after completion of TI@@ R transport , the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or container is re @-@ executed . &quot;
&quot; road vehicles or trucks carrying a TI@@ R transport have to carry out a rectangular , the characteristics of the system 5 corresponding board with the inscription &quot; &quot; TI@@ R &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these boards must be attached so that they are well visible ; they must be removable .
&quot; ( 1 ) For each road vehicle or any container , a separate Car@@ net TI@@ R is to be made . &quot;
&quot; however , a single car@@ net can be made for a lor@@ ry or for several containers which are loaded on a single road vehicle or a truck . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , the Car@@ net TI@@ R must be listed separately in the Car@@ net TI@@ R of the content of each vehicle belonging to a lor@@ ry or container . &quot;
&quot; there must be at least as many separ@@ able acceptance and dischar@@ ging cuts , as required for the transport in question . &quot;
&quot; a TI@@ R transport may be carried out over several departure and identification duties ; if there is no other regulation by the relevant contracting party or the relevant contractual parties , the departure customs must be located in one country and the same country ; &quot;
B ) the identification number should be located in no more than two different countries ;
&quot; the goods and the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or the container are the exit customs office with the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
the customs authorities of the out@@ sour@@ ced country meet the necessary measures to convince themselves of the correctness of the goods and to verify the customs closures or to check the custom @-@ made customs closures under their responsibility .
&quot; customs authorities can set a deadline for the journey through their country and require that the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or the containers hold a prescribed route . &quot;
&quot; the road vehicle , the lor@@ ry or the container are to be carried out with the cargo handling and the corresponding Car@@ net TI@@ R of each passage of passage and the identification duties for control . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The thorou@@ gh@@ far@@ es of each contracting party , as a rule , recognise the un@@ last customs agreements made by the customs authorities of the other contracting parties , unless a complaint of the goods is made in accordance with Article 5 ( 2 ) paragraph 2 . &quot;
&quot; however , customs authorities may , however , be able to create their own customs agreements if necessary . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The customs closures , recognised by a contracting party , enjoy the same legal protection as national customs closures in their territory . &quot;
&quot; customs authorities may only be accompanied in exceptional cases - road vehicles , cargo vessels or containers in their country at the expense of the transport operator , &quot;
&quot; - on the way , control and a sei@@ z@@ ure of goods loading of road vehicles , trucks or containers . &quot;
&quot; if the customs authorities take a sei@@ z@@ ure of cargo handling of a road vehicle , a truck or a container at a transit bus or on the way , they have to mem@@ ori@@ ze the new customs closures and the type of checks that are carried out in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; if customs closures are viol@@ ated or damaged in other than the cases mentioned in the articles 24 and 35 or are damaged or damaged without any breach of the customs clearance , the protocol contained in Anne@@ x 1 shall be recorded and the protocol contained in the Car@@ net TI@@ R shall remain un@@ affected . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) If a transport with Car@@ net TI@@ R on a partial stretch is the territory of a state , which is not the contracting party of this Convention , the TI@@ R transport will be suspended during the passage through this territory . &quot;
&quot; in such a case , the Cust@@ oms Auth@@ orities of the contracting party , through whose territory the goods are subsequently convey@@ ed , recognize the Car@@ net TI@@ R for the continuation of TI@@ R transport , provided that the customs closures and / or the non @-@ reference marks remain intact . &quot;
( 2 ) The same applies to the part of the route on which the owner of the Car@@ net TI@@ R in the territory of a contracting party does not use the Car@@ net because simpler procedures for the Cust@@ oms Goods shipping offer or the use of such a procedure is not required .
&quot; ( 3 ) In such cases , the customs authorities in which the TI@@ R transport is exposed or re @-@ recorded , as a passage point at the exit resp@@ . passage of passage at the entrance . &quot;
&quot; subject to the provisions of this Convention , in particular of Article 18 , the original duty of identification may be replaced by another identification unit . &quot;
&quot; upon arrival of the cargo at the destination customs office , the Car@@ net TI@@ R is to be carried out un@@ condition@@ ally , provided that the goods are supplied to another customs procedure or to be carried out for free circulation . &quot;
( 1 ) This section applies only to the transport of extra@@ ordinarily heavy or bul@@ ky goods within the meaning of Article 1 ( k ) .
&quot; ( 2 ) When applying this section , exceptionally heavy and bul@@ ky goods can be convey@@ ed without a customs connection , depending on the decision of the departure point with vehicles or containers . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) This section shall only be applied if , according to the point of departure , the utility of extra@@ ordinarily heavy or bul@@ ky goods , as well as the necessary accessories , can be kept on the basis of an existing description without further notice , or that they cannot be replaced or removed , without leaving any clear marks . &quot;
&quot; all provisions of this Convention , of which the special provisions of this section shall not devi@@ ate , shall also apply to the transport of extra@@ ordinarily heavy or bul@@ ky goods in the TI@@ R process . &quot;
&quot; the liability of the Br@@ inging Association does not only cover the goods listed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , but also on goods which are not listed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , but are located on the loading area or between the goods listed in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; the Car@@ net TI@@ R used must be applied on the envelope and on all sections in English or French , in highlighted letters , the note &quot; &quot; ordinary heavy or bul@@ ky goods &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customs office may require that Lad@@ el@@ ists , photographs , plans , etc . , necessary for the protection of the goods transported are attached to the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
&quot; in this case , they see these papers with their stamp , are printed on the back of the Car@@ net TI@@ R coating , and notices this in all mani@@ folds . &quot;
the thorou@@ gh@@ far@@ es of each party are recognized by the relevant authorities of the other contracting parties tied to customs closures and / or utility signs .
&quot; you can , however , attach additional customs closures and / or utility signs , but must be noted on the Car@@ net TI@@ R sections used in their country , on the relevant trunk fl@@ aps and on the remaining sections remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R , note the newly mounted customs closures and / or utility signs . &quot;
&quot; if customs authorities have to lose or remove non @-@ public signs at a transit bus or on the way because of a complaint of the goods loading customs closures , they mem@@ ori@@ ze the new customs closures and / or simil@@ arity signs remaining in the Car@@ net TI@@ R . &quot;
those who viol@@ ate the provisions of this Convention are pun@@ is@@ hable by the laws of the country in which the infrin@@ gement was committed .
&quot; it cannot be determined where the in@@ consistency has been committed , so it is deemed to be in the territory of the contracting party in which it has been established . &quot;

1 . the contractual parties are not taken into account minor devi@@ ations from the availability of the obligations related to the time period and the travel route .
&quot; the customs administr@@ ations of the departure and destination country may not cause any devi@@ ations to the Car@@ net @-@ TI@@ R holder , if these devi@@ ations concern customs procedures that took place before or after the TI@@ R transport and where the owner of the Car@@ net was not involved . &quot;

&quot; B ) In order to guarantee the optimal cost efficiency , the following procedures are applied for example : I ) spatial knu@@ ck@@ ling as a means of determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes ; &quot;
&quot; III ) Con@@ centr@@ ation of the verification procedure to the phases of the fuel cycle , which may affect the production , processing , use and storage of core material without further nuclear weapons and other core material , provided that this does not hin@@ der the implementation of this convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) To effectively carry out the securing measures following this Convention , the Community of the Organization issued information on nuclear material , which is subject to securing measures , and about the characteristics of the facilities which are for the implementation of the securing measures relating to this material of si@@ ang . &quot;
B ) The organisation requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of their tasks according to the Convention .
&quot; ( II ) Information on systems is limited to minimum level , which is necessary for the use of securing measures relating to core material , which is subject to the safety precau@@ tions under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) On request of the Community , the organisation is prepared to examine the investment data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be materi@@ ally superf@@ lu@@ ous , provided that they remain accessible for further testing by the organisation in the premises of the community without further notice . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation fet@@ ches the consent of the community and states to the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; ( II ) The community either raises or several alternative denom@@ inations , either against a proposed designation , or at any time against a given designation , thus suggests the organisation of the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; according to the repeated refusal of the Community , to appro@@ ve the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organisation , the Council shall discuss the refusal , after the General Director of the Organization - in the following referred to as &quot; the Director General , &quot; discusses with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
B ) The Community and the concerned States undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually perform the tasks according to their agreement .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organisation are established in such a way that i ) are as low as possible for the possible nu@@ is@@ ance and disturb@@ ance of the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities that are subject to the inspection ;
( II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information to the inspec@@ tors of the organisation .
&quot; every State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and balances , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials , to fulfill the provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention are termin@@ ated with regard to core material , if the community and the organization determine that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is not usable for a nuclear activity which is under the viewpoint of the securing measures of si@@ zzle , is no longer usable or practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the Community notes the organisation according to this Convention , the transfer of core material from the states , which is subject to the safety precau@@ tions under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention will be termin@@ ated with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken over responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents from which any passing on , and if necessary , the re @-@ application of the securing measures on the given core material comes out . &quot;
&quot; core material , which is subject to security measures according to this agreement , should be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of alloys or ceramics , so does the association with the organisation of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures after this Convention can be termin@@ ated regarding this material . &quot;
&quot; II ) that during the duration of non @-@ application of the securing measures , the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other core explo@@ sives . &quot;
B ) The organisation and community meet a regulation that the securing measures provided in this Convention are not applied as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; the regulation will determine as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organisation will be held on the ongoing basis of the total amount and composition of this material in the respective state or the relevant states , and on any passing on such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains their understanding as quickly as possible ; it covers only matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for the reporting , but does not include endor@@ sement or a conc@@ ise understanding of the military activity and does not include the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or persons who are subject to their national sovereignty , but extraordinary expenses as a result of a special request of the organisation , will reimbur@@ se the organisation of these costs , provided that they have agreed beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states ensure that the liability of liability for nuclear damage , including an insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organisation and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or state has been asser@@ ted against the organisation or the organisation vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the organisation or the organisation , with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , which has ar@@ isen from the implementation of the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the relevant information provided by the Director General , the Council stipul@@ ates that the organization must not be able to verify that no core material , which has to be subject to security measures in accordance with this Convention , may reimbur@@ se the reports envis@@ aged in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was acquired by the applied securing measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the advice the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , the community or a state consultations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions , which arise from the interpretation or application of this convention , are reviewed by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any dispute referred to by Article 19 or a measure adopted by the Council shall be disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which shall not be included in the negotiations or by another by the Organisation , the Community and the States , on the request of a party to be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal consisting of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also design@@ ates two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth , who will be ch@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not appointed two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration , then the community or the organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure applies if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal may be appe@@ aled and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention res@@ ig@@ ns for non @-@ core weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
( II ) when the organization of the organisation noti@@ fies that it is able to apply their securing measures in relation to this State for the purposes of this Convention .
&quot; a ) The organisation , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the Parties to am@@ end this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all member states of the organization from every change of this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention remains in force as long as the States Parties of the Treaty are .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this Agreement signi@@ fies the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure as required in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the procedures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as the det@@ err@@ ence of such an exit by the risk of early discovery .
&quot; in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as securing measures of fundamental importance , verbal and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the veri@@ fications by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone , the quantity of material that is not proven for a certain period of time , stating the limits of accuracy for the specified measurements . &quot;
&quot; when carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organisation is making full use of the Community &apos;s securing system after article 3 . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the community will make use of the method and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , see how they are more closely determined and useful in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of existing , manufactured , lost , lost , or otherwise from the stock of nuclear material and stock volumes ; &quot;
B ) the assessment of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
e ) method for evaluating accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which shows the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory for each material balance zone , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
&quot; ( g ) precau@@ tions , which ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety precau@@ tions under this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
&quot; ( B ) If the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) is not yet reached , the community of the organisation shares the amount and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced to specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; the core material , which is based on composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ open@@ an enrich@@ ment , relies on the plant or the process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the States at a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle , thus it is subject to the safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is , however , the opinion that the recovery of core material , which is temporarily not possible or desirable , consult the organisation and community on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the community are hereby affir@@ med that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in gram - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization liber@@ ates nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire core material quantity delivered in the States is at no time more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alle@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Uran@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight by enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ( III ) Ur@@ an , with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of the enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; a total of ten metric tons of natural @-@ ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; C ) 20 metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; if delivered nuclear material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subjected to , processed or stored in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions for re@@ application of the securing measures are made to that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are required in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective realization of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in the individual to determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention shall apply . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without any change of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires a connection between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organisation represents a consolidated invent@@ ories of the whole , the securing measures of the underlying core material in the States irrespective of its origin , and carries on this stock index by the subsequent reports and the results of their veri@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; GR@@ Ã@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation , to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resource @-@ traffic problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the purpose of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution is bound by the Member States within six months of the entry into force of the Agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the Organisation of the E@@ EC submitted a table to which it is inten@@ tionally intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organization speci@@ fies a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special action account &quot; , &quot; which is made up of the funds that member states do to the special transaction ; this account is governed by the organization as an administrator trust@@ ee and used ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; administrator &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose defined in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is separate and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able deb@@ tors of the member state which to pay on demand in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and depos@@ ited at the depos@@ iting location of the organization in the respective country .
B ) the payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the administr@@ ate agreed date ;
&quot; the second in the amount of the remainder of the entry to 1 January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Any Member State can make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates if desired .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organisation , the manager takes about propor@@ tion@@ al draws on cash or j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal forms in order to cover expenses for the promotion loans and compens@@ ate for the special transaction account appropriately . &quot;
&quot; when gran@@ ting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC : &quot;
III ) the scope in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and trend of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit absorption capacity on loan conditions without a discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any promotion loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapid pay@@ able development program or project ( including sec@@ toral anticip@@ ation ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices which are to be taken into account for the purposes of the organization funded by the organization , the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement is to be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the promotion account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the Bank or the Organization by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the date of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions that apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in ten free years each in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts for payment of this watch are pay@@ able directly to the organization that it re@@ tains .
&quot; each special transaction is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is indicated in particular . &quot;
&quot; the income from any promotion loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the receiving country or for goods or services , which are established in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and who have determined what the administrator decided at the time of loan approval , recipients of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of a special transaction are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this manner in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted to the Member State as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State . &quot;
the administrator will inform the E@@ EC about the plans and programs approved by the directors for the complete assignment of all special transactions in preparation for the verification by the directors in preparation and about the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
&quot; during the period of payment of the special transaction , the manager has informed the EE@@ A quar@@ terly on the development of the special transactions loan and the expenses incurred for this . &quot;
the manager transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special account accounts with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization on this account .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction , the manager of the E@@ EC transfers as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes suitable records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the payments to the Member States are obvious . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the full release of the means of the special transaction account from time to time lead to an exchange of thoughts on the stand of the special transaction account , the progress of the programs or plans financed by special transactions , and on all other questions relating to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount claimed by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement will be rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations resulting from the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fy the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate these procedures .
the General Sec@@ retariat conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
&quot; this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the named noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two original manus@@ cri@@ pts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , each wor@@ ding is equally binding . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement should be concluded in the form of a correspondence to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DE RE@@ LA@@ SS@@ ES : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN nuclear community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental facility , the project J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are named after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Business J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years now , Switzerland has been dealing with research projects in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area in question . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contract parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze its relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research projects that have attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable every contracting party to gain the greatest possible benefit through a merger of its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for mutual research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective competitive power generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the parties agree to their respective research programmes , listed below in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term objectives and the forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or amended by the bodies mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties accept a new program , it will be replaced by the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 shall be realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third states , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; within the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the parties conclude an association agreement , which corresponds to those between the Commission and the states and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of human resources , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Agreement on Human Change &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Common Market J@@ ET , whose statutes are accepted . &quot;
Eur@@ atom also bears concern that Switzerland can become the contractual partner of any contract whose objective is to be concluded in the framework of the present agreement except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the executive bodies responsible for carrying out the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 - 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , and thus to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme - in the following &quot; &quot; V@@ G &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions relating to ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom Programme , is the task of all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T * ness in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common objective established in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in the Swiss programme and on the common objective defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the context of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek to . &quot;
&quot; the consulting groups , who submit to the V@@ G research proposals with regard to the funding granted for the Eur@@ atom programme , take up this task with regard to all research and development work that is taken into account in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented in the Committee of directors appointed as part of the Eur@@ atom programme by the director of one of the laboratories involved .
&quot; the committee &apos;s committee , which has to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme , is responsible for the optimal use of the capacities of laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme , under@@ lines this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all co @-@ ordin@@ ating committees used as part of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide appropriate proposals for the use of resources , personnel and knowledge and skills that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme , take this task in the respective area with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F is a responsible for the core and energy research of each member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and each associated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions and in the preparation of future programmes and the definition of its overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the V@@ G , the Director Committee , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the decision of the V@@ G to the urgent actions is mandatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of HR ex@@ chang@@ ers .
representatives of both parties work on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies created for the purpose of this agreement .
&quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom Programme in accordance with this agreement will be held annually at the cost of the Eur@@ atom Programme at the same rate as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as it is built . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland has re@@ mitted an amount to the Common Market J@@ ET according to the provisions of the Stat@@ ute of this Joint undertaking . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for financing of the work as part of the association agreement and the agreement on human resources , is calculated on the same basis that is usually used to calculate Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on account of the relevant contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission will inform the Bundes@@ rat at the beginning of the year , which amount to cover expenses in the context of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year . &quot;

&quot; in any stand@@ by loan , the BIS would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ing stocks without exceeding five years altogether . &quot;

&quot; in addition , it is agreed that the first dra@@ fts may not be made before the end of a month following completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity . &quot;

&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for h@@ amm@@ ers - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the actual quantity actually executed is not exceeding the agreed amount and executed according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; if a change in the supply form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties agree to each other prior to introducing such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community demands protection clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina has not been touched on the common market in this agreement . &quot;

&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount determined under number 2 according to the volume of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new Member States are determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will take into account the Ho@@ ech@@ st rate of exhaus@@ tion under number 5 .
&quot; the total quantity listed under number 2 will be set on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community on 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight . &quot;
&quot; the community has everything to avoid market development , which could compromise the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ ers and lam@@ bs on the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community applies precau@@ tions to prevent the sale of frozen meat on frozen meat because of the implementation of the regulation the paragraph of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat is not under@@ min@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; whereas for Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion into the competence of the community falls under the agreement by which it has been established , which has the required powers to do so ; &quot;
&quot; considering that it is necessary for the implementation of Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , that the European Economic Community Party of the Con@@ federation can become the contracting party - &quot;
the Convention enters into force for the community on the first day of the month that follows the signature .
&quot; it enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day when the last of the contracting parties depos@@ ited their acceptance certificate with the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) This additional protocol , however , occurs after the exp@@ iry of two years after the date in which it has been laid down , unless one of the contracting parties has notified a objection to his entry into force . &quot;
&quot; from this point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without being at the same time contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , every acceptance or objection in accordance with Article 2 and the time of the entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; following the entry into force of this Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite every non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the member of the Council and the United States ( a ) the date of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members , who have signed or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ; &quot;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with a notice to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe for a period of one year .
&quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples , containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by ever renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to the double in a suitable medium .
the tit@@ er is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest servo dil@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution will only be calculated by the volume of the volume of the blood cells in the total volume .
&quot; in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has defined International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are being worked out at the time . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ans observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter that is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
&quot; the ti@@ ler speci@@ fies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the tit@@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , so contain the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sc@@ iss@@ ors according to definition 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a similar ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Standard of Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain intact for at least one year . &quot;
&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a cur@@ sed form , according to the label , is at most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , namely in the glass container in which it has been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may not exceed 0.5 litres of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the agent ( or the solv@@ ents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to have the conditions of specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein @-@ nitrogen per ml liquid or re@@ plen@@ ished ser@@ ums .
&quot; re@@ agents , in@@ different , whether in fluid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least as long as the International Convention entered into a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative con@@ tro@@ ll blood cells .
&quot; the quantity , which is present in a container , must be so large that the content may be used to perform the efficacy tests described in this protocol . &quot;
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all production stages and controls of re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination .
&quot; proper samples of all the re@@ agents are kept from the laboratory until , with some probability , it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintenance of the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective attachment . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents can not contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each container , a black printed label is available in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4. the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ charging &quot;

&quot; an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ds of A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period that is necessary if the same attempts with the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or with a standard preparation of equal activity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed to an object carrier with an equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % u@@ in@@ ating of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period that is necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a standard prepar@@ atory of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; if an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5 @-@ to 10 % flood of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â° C. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h Blood groups sera of any specific@@ ity can be one of two species , which differ in the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is reached . &quot;
&quot; with others described as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved with presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods . &quot;
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on objects bear@@ ers also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells which are inhi@@ bited in their own ser@@ um or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may possibly change if International standard preparations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Blood group ser@@ um ( human )
anti @-@ D ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it respon@@ ds to human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ um is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ isons to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the ser@@ um should react with blood cells that contain Do @-@ An@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are designed to use object bear@@ ers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immune to the Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ds of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these Ser@@ a are therefore specific for C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the blood cells have been tested in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) , must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and should not contain Anti @-@ D ) , must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of imm@@ uni@@ zed persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E ser@@ um .
&quot; in a given ser@@ um , both antibodies must be effective at the same time among the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a ser@@ um is intended for use on object bear@@ ers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be less than with the propor@@ tion@@ ate antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ An@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2B ; there ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that do not contain A an@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups 0 and B. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A ser@@ um is parallel to the re@@ plen@@ ished , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or corresponding compar@@ isons , separated with floo@@ ds of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5 @-@ to 10 % flood of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , which is necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the re@@ plen@@ ished but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ um or a standard prepar@@ atory of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B ser@@ um is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , that is those of the blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B ser@@ um is parallel to the re@@ plen@@ ished , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or a corresponding compar@@ isons , with a floo@@ ding of blood cells of group B to ti@@ tr@@ eren ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B ser@@ um is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % u@@ in@@ ating of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period that is necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the re@@ plen@@ ished but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ um or with a standard prepar@@ atory of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ Human Glob@@ ulin Ser@@ um for use in blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals that are immun@@ ised by injection of human ser@@ um proteins .
&quot; if it is used by the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , there are no un@@ laden human red blood cells , in@@ different , which blood group they belong to . &quot;

the Parties of the European Convention of 14 May 1962 on the exchange of re@@ agents for blood group determination are ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Convention &quot; ) -
&quot; based on article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention , which &quot; the Parties shall take all necessary measures , &quot; in order to free them from all other parties provided by the other parties , to free human origin from all input charges ; &quot;
&quot; whereas for Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this exemp@@ tion into the competence of the community falls under the agreement by which it has been established , which has the required powers to do so ; &quot;
&quot; at the time of its entry into force , this additional protocol is part of the Convention . from that point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without being at the same time contracting party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , every acceptance or objection in accordance with Article 2 and the time of the entry into force of this additional protocol according to Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; based on the common declaration adopted by the Ministers of the EF@@ TA countries and the Member States of the Community , as well as by the Commission of the European Communities , on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fying the border form@@ alities and the country of origin , &quot;
&quot; in the awakening that the Community decided to strengthen the internal market within the programme of action to strengthen the internal market , to introduce a uniform administrative paper in in@@ tra @-@ Community goods traffic from 1 January 1988 , &quot;
&quot; in the estim@@ ation that it is appropriate to simplify the simil@@ arities between the community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by introducing a uniform administrative paper , &quot;
&quot; in the estim@@ ation of the fact that this Convention may not be interpreted as such , that it dis@@ integr@@ ates the contractual parties from its obligations from other international conventions - &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transport of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between individual EF@@ TA countries ; this is in particular a uniform administrative paper ( herein@@ after referred to as a unity paper ) , which is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a shipping method agreed in between the contractual parties ( herein@@ after referred to as the shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the partic@@ ul@@ arities linked to the goods transport between the contractual parties are fu@@ ell@@ bound by a single unit , which are to be used in Anne@@ x I to the Convention according to the patterns in Anne@@ x I . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the unit paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping procedures or import . &quot;
&quot; - explicitly required to carry out the legislation in force in a contract party , whose application would not be guaranteed in the sole use of the unit paper ; &quot;
&quot; - to be requested by the participants , so that they may come to an application in the enjoyment of an advantage or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This agreement does not hin@@ der the contracting parties , simplified procedures , even under the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In particular , these procedures can be seen in particular that the relevant goods are not present at a customs site and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs authority ; furthermore , the submission of an un@@ complete registration can be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in these cases , it is necessary to register a registration , where the competent authorities will be informed of peri@@ odic collection registration , within the deadline set by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use trading papers instead of the unit paper . &quot;
&quot; the filing page is used , so the participants with the consent of the competent authorities can add to the import and import@@ ation of related items instead of the amend@@ ment to the filing page in trade , in which the goods are described . &quot;
- to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of mort@@ g@@ ages for their entire goods transport or sub @-@ sectors ;
&quot; - for shipments , which include several types of goods , to be able to use freight for@@ wards in the shipping process of charge boxes instead of the supplementary sheets to a single paper ; &quot;
&quot; - allow applications to be created , if necessary , without pre @-@ printing by public or private data processing systems according to the conditions specified by the competent authorities ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities to request the data required for the detection of the relevant loc@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of registr@@ ations , and if necessary , without giving a written registration ; &quot;
&quot; - allow the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of registr@@ ations , that the export , shipping or import registration is either created by the registration paper created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering data into the data processing system ; &quot;
&quot; - to apply eas@@ ements adopted by the Committee in the way of a resolution , pursuant to Article 11 ( 3 ) paragraph 3 . &quot;
( 1 ) App@@ endi@@ x II to the Convention shall be laid down in Anne@@ x II to this Convention .
&quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the pre @-@ prints listed in Anne@@ x I , are to be found in the App@@ endi@@ x III on this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The registration is to be authorised in one of the official languages of the contractual parties , authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the authorities shall be authorised for export or shipping . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country of origin or transit country may request a translation of the registration in the official language or one of the official languages of this country in this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) In devi@@ ating from paragraph 1 , the registration must be carried out in one of the official languages of the import country if they are registered in this country by use of other than the copies submitted to the customs office of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The registration or its representative may apply for each individual process section of a goods traffic between the contractual parties , which may only be used in this one section to assist in this one section , which may be attached to the sub@@ missions required to assist in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be associated with a special condition of the competent authority .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions concerning con@@ sign@@ ments , however , the competent authorities can see that the partic@@ ul@@ arities for export and shipping procedures can be found on one and the same pre @-@ print by means of the copies provided for these partic@@ ul@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities shall be convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the copies sold in the individual sections of the application shall be in accordance with the agreement . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth flow of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the un@@ covering of in@@ effectiveness or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries ask each other on request or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or rejected in whole or in part , if the sought @-@ after country of view is that the official aid would imp@@ air its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate operational , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the case of refusal or rejection of the administrative assistance , the corresponding decision and its grounds are in@@ accessible to the seeking country . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) Does the customs authority of a country seek administrative assistance , which could not afford it , if it would seek it , so she points out in her search for this circum@@ stance . &quot;
( 5 ) The information obtained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention and enjoy the protection that the national law of the country that it has received shall be granted for information of this kind .
&quot; these information may only be used with written consent of the Cust@@ oms Authority , which has given them and subject to restrictions imposed by this authority . &quot;
( 1 ) A mixed shot is used in which every contracting party is represented by this Convention .
( 4 ) There is a Rules of Proced@@ ure which regul@@ ates the conven@@ ing of meetings as well as the appointment of the chairman and the duration of his term of office .
&quot; ( 5 ) The Committee &apos;s Committee may use sub @-@ committees and working groups , which support him in his tasks . &quot;
( 1 ) The Committee &apos;s Committee has the task to ad@@ minister this Convention and ensure proper application .
&quot; to do so , the committee is regularly informed about the practical experience with the application of the Convention ; he expresses recommendations and summ@@ ari@@ zes 3 decisions in the cases referred to in paragraph 3 . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Committee shall appro@@ ve changes of the app@@ endi@@ ces to this Convention , as well as the facil@@ itation mentioned in Article 4 ( 3 ) last thought @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the Cabinet adopted a decision under the retention of the constitutional requirements , the decision , if there is no date , shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after the notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party takes appropriate measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this convention , whereby the need to take into account the disrup@@ tions of freight transport as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions arising from the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territories of the EF@@ TA countries on the other hand . &quot;
( 2 ) This agreement applies to the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein as long as the Princip@@ ality with the Swiss Con@@ federation is connected through a customs union treaty .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with respect to a twelve @-@ month period ; the written notice of termination must be addressed to the de@@ posit@@ ary mentioned in Article 17 that noti@@ fies them to all other contracting parties .
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , provided that the Parties agreed to the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities by 1 November 1987 . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) If this Convention enters into force on 1 January 1988 , it enters into force on the first day of the second month after the last certificate of acceptance . &quot;
&quot; this Convention is written in a Title in Danish , German , English , Finnish , French , Greek , Icel@@ an@@ dic , Italian , Dutch , Norwegian , Portuguese , Swedish and Spanish ; it is depos@@ ited in the archives of the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities . &quot;
I allow myself to propose the following agreement which will serve as the basis for a cooperation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Marine Research .
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; can ask the International Council for Marine Research , herein@@ after called &quot; Council , &quot; to provide recommendations regarding the management of fish stocks and related issues , and the Council will come as far as possible . &quot;
&quot; 2 . in view of the responsibility of the Commission in issues of management of fish stocks , the Council agrees to present all relevant reports of its working groups to assess the stock status as well as the reports of its advisory fish@@ eries committee . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission will regularly discuss how the cooperation between the two parties will intensi@@ fy , and in particular investigate the possibilities offered by the Commission to establish closer relations with the Advisory Board of F@@ ish@@ eries of the Council . &quot;
&quot; 4 . at the signing of this agreement , the Community will pay a total of 3@@ 76 000 d@@ k@@ r and then make annual payments . &quot;
the annual fee does not include the cost of meetings which are conven@@ ed at the special request of the Commission .
&quot; 5 . three years after the entry into force of this agreement , the provisions of both parties will be reviewed again . &quot;
&quot; if no new provisions are agreed , the agreement extends on the basis of existing provisions , until new agreements have been negotiated . &quot;
any party at any time has the cru@@ el@@ ty to res@@ ign from the agreement with respect to a one @-@ year notice period .
&quot; with regard to clause 3 , the Council agrees to recognize the observer status in meetings of the Advisory Committee on F@@ ish@@ eries Management of the Council by a scientifically qualified representative of the Commission . &quot;
&quot; in this capacity , the representative of the Commission would have the right to ask the word and participate in the meetings , but would not have the right to vote , nor the possibility to change the agen@@ das of meetings . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to tell me whether these agreements are the basis of a cooperation between your Council and the Community for you .
I assume that this letter and your answer to this are the agreement on cooperation between the International Council for Marine Research and the European Economic Community .
