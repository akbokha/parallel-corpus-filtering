this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please refer to the packing material ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. When thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elevation ) with periods of normal sen@@ timent . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent multiple episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral taking of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or to treat the sm@@ el@@ ting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing pills . &quot;
&quot; patients who simultaneously take other medicines , which are exactly as same as A@@ bili@@ fy , should be adjusted to the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow communication of nerve cells among themselves . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the brain activity , thereby preventing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its re@@ occurrence . &quot;
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the re@@ occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over a year .
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study , the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent re@@ occurrence in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with bili@@ fy . &quot;
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared with a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest associated with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body res@@ or@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg gave a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally given to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yram@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled access ) , trau@@ ma ( constant movement ) , sed@@ ation , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , who mostly talked about treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , prevail against the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with biochem@@ ical episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , when oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy to the entire European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group , a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the aria pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no elevated suicide risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sc@@ in@@ esis occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if patients with a abili@@ fy treat signs and symptoms of late dy@@ n@@ esia , consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a brain , or un@@ equi@@ vocal high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of urine , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be ab@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , which allow direct compar@@ isons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ urethane , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , respectively an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore , similar dosage reductions should be made . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers can result in the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensively metabol@@ is@@ ers .
&quot; if one considers the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly potent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore , similar dosage reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with abili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
&quot; in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data layer for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused by animal reproduction , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side @-@ effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ias , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of eps was 19 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under top@@ ical zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
some episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of eps 23.@@ 5 % was observed in patients under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ n@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma cutting band@@ aging . &quot;
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ receptor as well as an even aff@@ inity for the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; the posit@@ ron @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ c @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at Put@@ amen . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant increase of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a half @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study medicine were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study destinations including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lang @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia over 26 weeks , comprised of 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study &quot; weight gain &quot; was , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and actively @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a performance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic regim@@ ens , the accompanying therapy with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole yiel@@ ded superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in some patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in preventing a recur@@ rence in the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ ing is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites about CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a variation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics gave no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different radi@@ ant liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans so that they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ ce ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times of the mean ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l are not more than 6 % of concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of ape , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sc@@ in@@ esis occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .

the recommended starting dose for ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the enam@@ el tablets to abili@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .

abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control Agi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with bi@@ polar episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically mounted , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under the circum@@ stance of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines which are already used for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a secondary oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to abili@@ fy tablets , abili@@ fy melting pills or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no investigations for the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with Agi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder . &quot;
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution as necessary , patients should be observed regarding an extreme sed@@ ation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ation ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ emic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;

&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ urethane , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to that after all the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly and simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ising , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore , similar dosage reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of abili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;

107 The following side @-@ effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of eps was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and plac@@ ebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ n@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , compared to plac@@ ebo , were compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of the Agi@@ ti@@ ousness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am @-@ reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement observed from initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe low@@ ness , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be detected due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) compared to plac@@ ebo had a statisti@@ cally significant increase in psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a half @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study medicine were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study destinations , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;

&quot; in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger than the AU@@ C after receiving the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies for the re@@ production toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns g@@ ged after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) were about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only when dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus , they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects covered a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ ce ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were previously received an Anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients with abra@@ x@@ ane spoke to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving the conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to the deteri@@ oration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be used for patients who are breast@@ feeding , or at the beginning of the treatment , have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with the first treatment was not more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , and that unlike other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel medicines , it was not necessary to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ p@@ hi@@ lic count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or serious sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced in the following series to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy levels 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data for recommen@@ ding dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ ar@@ it@@ em@@ ulation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have substantially different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in patients no renewed abra@@ sive treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils count again to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been detected , cardiac incidents in the inde@@ xed patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if they occur after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive methods . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not exercise an effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; males , who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; before treatment , male patients should be advised of a sperm count , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) which can affect the traffic stability and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; the following are the most common and most important cases of side @-@ effects performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy have occurred in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , elevated l@@ act@@ ating hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated cre@@ atine in the blood , elevated blood sugar , elevated phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

&quot; pain in the chest body , weakness of the mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , dis@@ comfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequently : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive fall in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events has been established . &quot;
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active agent that promotes the co@@ ag@@ ulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ated the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ dot@@ hel@@ i@@ ale transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two clu@@ eless un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with metastatic breast cancer , which was administered in the form of inf@@ usion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who received treatment of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel either in the form of solvent @-@ containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % had metastatic disease and 19 % due to metast@@ as@@ sion and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy levels 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative Tox@@ ic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the active ingredient exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Acc@@ ording to the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in multi @-@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or soft binding of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ic ex@@ cre@@ tion of the un@@ altered drug was 4 % of the total total dose of less than 1 % of the Met@@ abolic 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , there are only a few data available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of bright light over 8 hours .
p@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ular drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a sterile sy@@ ringe , 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de inf@@ usion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane cookie bottle . &quot;
&quot; after complete addition of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solids . &quot;

member states must ensure that the owner of the permit for placing the market in front of the market will provide healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochures • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging material . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes for transport by the patients . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood iron values , which may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications if a blood @-@ blood donation is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the drug is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver provided that they have received an appropriate guidance .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are to be monitored before treatment , to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference medicinal product . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 .
&quot; the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed , inj@@ ected under the skin , were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continue to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in compliance with the European Union rules , evidence has been provided that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which makes Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is based on the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned bigger operative procedures requiring a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml will be applied not to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed on or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose that is required for checking the an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients whose initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of symptoms and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose that is required to control the symptoms symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ticul@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ticul@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has risen by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an response to ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre@@ dispos@@ able deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serving , should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure . &quot;
&quot; iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age program begins , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ o@@ ec@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation system . &quot;
&quot; patients who are diagnosed with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a Ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who are intended for a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age program are contra@@ indicated by ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial oc@@ clusi@@ on , vascular disease of the carcin@@ oma or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with a recently restored heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden effect loss , defined as a reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the Re@@ ticul@@ um value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ ous toxic@@ ation , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ oo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be weigh@@ ed for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In case of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency patients should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is attribut@@ able to the administration of ep@@ ox@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control the symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fusion . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in Section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; based on the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , is not accelerated . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chemotherapy , ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa administration and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ figured ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output bonus of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may occur . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ o@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival for tumor patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or decrease the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;

the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
gene@@ tically obtained ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa stimul@@ ates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis not affected .

survival and tumour progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and control patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an unprecedented , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in the controls due to several more common mal@@ ign@@ omas . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transmitt@@ ing a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um level of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is much lower than the ser@@ um level obtained after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known comp@@ lication of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ om or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years ago , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients not treated with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;

&quot; you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clusi@@ on ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the carcin@@ oma ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ) you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells within the normal range , which again re@@ forms to further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will carry out regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; lacking iron , dis@@ solution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before the onset of therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ antibody ti@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ ia after month @-@ to @-@ year treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin of inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie , it will break your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , secre@@ tion must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; when elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor can take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; based on the present knowledge , the treatment of the blood @-@ poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your red blood color values ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of a blood cl@@ ots ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be very carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from the treatment with ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if there have been thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events in the past ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ lo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can affect the tumor negative . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic operation , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment begins . &quot;
&quot; if your red blood dy@@ e values ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have received / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means for building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood an@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) speaks to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ a@@ emia respon@@ ds to treatment , the dose may be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating regular blood tests will carry out regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to sh@@ orten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the operation . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to splash yourself ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;
&quot; heart , heart attack , brain bleeding , stroke , temporary blood circulation disorders , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thy@@ roid , vascular dil@@ ations ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ men ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; eyel@@ ids and lips ( quin@@ ce ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , red@@ ness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution in applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is necessary &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood cl@@ ots ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) when your starting value is too high

&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or disc@@ ar@@ ded . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ayo is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture as in the inf@@ ant ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ayo may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ig@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ ra was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ayo was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance canc@@ els ) norm@@ alized in the blood or at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of ver@@ teb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most A@@ cl@@ asta side effects occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent with repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other component .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ ayo are liable to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion point and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( die @-@ dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ayo &apos;s manufacturer provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients where the drug side effects should be explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited approval for the transport of A@@ cl@@ ayo to the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast @-@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When looking back to medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • in post men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ ayo is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ayo is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ eral Inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
patients with kidney impair@@ ment ( see section 4.4 ) in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for this patient group are available .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) Dos@@ age adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ayo is not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness are missing .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ayo is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia should be treated with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the onset of therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be inter@@ woven with appropriate preventive dental treatment before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days of the administration of A@@ cl@@ ares can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ares ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of cases reported as serious side effects reported cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared with patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis trials ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was comparable between A@@ cl@@ ayo ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were in a clinical trial for o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after receiving was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta over 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study , local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was occasionally reported , especially in cancer patients , over o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extrac@@ tions or other dental interven@@ es . &quot;
7 study of 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients followed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw area in a patient with a plac@@ ebo and treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous calcium glu@@ con@@ ate intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing vort@@ ex body . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric ver@@ teb@@ rate re@@ frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ eral lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new spine @-@ body re@@ frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ave @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of fluid re@@ frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on Hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ayo had an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ares increased bone density on the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ral acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip at 6.0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; bone replacement mark@@ ers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period . &quot;
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ayo reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ayo compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
the effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ erot@@ ia treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at the overall height and fem@@ oral neck at all times .
&quot; over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the A@@ cl@@ ayo treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total and 4.3 % of the fem@@ oral neck . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ein @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone atri@@ um was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically verified , particularly light to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um @-@ level of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain levels was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ayo and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as the respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study were able to maintain the therapeutic response at 141 patients with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , in a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of permanent inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that the plasma @-@ bar rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value . &quot;
rapid bi @-@ phase disappearance from the large circul@@ atory cycle with half @-@ value periods t ½ α 0.0 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early stages ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of metabolic substances met@@ aboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a regular kidney function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 m@@ L / min does not require dose @-@ adjusting of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
&quot; since only limited data is available for severe kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0.6 mg / kg of body weight .
&quot; in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are 6@@ times of recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was measured in rats by using doses of 0.6 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in accumulated Ex@@ positions , which sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;

&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 will be in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
risks management plan The owner of the permit for placing the bill under@@ takes the studies and additional activities to pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance which are presented in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the adopted Version 004 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent versions of the R@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicinal products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot; &quot;
• A revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information will be disclosed which could affect the current claims for safety of pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been achieved .
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a group of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of bone . &quot;
&quot; decl@@ ining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; the bone reconstruction takes place too quickly with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , and new bone material is structured un@@ structured , making the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ayo works by norm@@ alising bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring regular bone formation and gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cl@@ ares with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take other medicines / apply or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to be damaging the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying A@@ cl@@ asta along with food and drinks , you are worried that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently vom@@ ited the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ ayo two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ cl@@ asta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that calcium levels in your blood are not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ares has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before finishing treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta If you are considering finishing the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please make your next doctor &apos;s min come true and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less frequent after subsequent inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ asta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of a low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

persistent pain and / or non @-@ healing wounds in the mouth or at the jaw were especially reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will be significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry out the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ayo two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ayo , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ayo . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please refer to the packing material ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or above and beyond or above and beyond one or more
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive drug for setting smoking in comparison to a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the setting of the smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? he The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia seen during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tissue . n@@ g The full listing of side effects reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia is to take out the packing supplement .
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ic@@ idal thoughts among a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is offered while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for application at HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight
&quot; applied to patients who need health and not cosmetic reasons ( by providing education for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also show one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ id@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , suicide rate with up to 1 % of the patients receiving the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied in depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - apart from obesity - have no recognis@@ able risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other nearby persons are to be noted that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice when these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) before less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2- diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who achieved a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .

improving the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients receiving the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg was about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z

&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the adverse effects that were not observed in clinical trials , however , which were not observed in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic range , were considered potentially relevant to the clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no undes@@ irable effects were observed on the fertility or men@@ stru@@ al disturb@@ ances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post @-@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and means of lac@@ tation does not affect learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) can be applied , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with sul@@ fa @-@ resin or insulin , the existing dosage of the sul@@ fa @-@ resin or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Ac@@ tos therapy , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should reduce the dosage of the sul@@ fa @-@ resin or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,000 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one was tested in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fa drugs , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels when using dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl glue in lower H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 289 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturb@@ ances , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ge@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited permission to operate Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately controlled with insulin and is in@@ appropriate in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available to use pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one for patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor ( e.g. past cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with a reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of the liver ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range , the liver enzyme values are again to be monitored again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as uns@@ ett@@ led nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , upper buil@@ du@@ p , ti@@ red@@ ness , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enzyme values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued should be led by the clinical evaluation to the outcome of the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which may be ag@@ it@@ ating of fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a consequence of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch was marketed under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , about an occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the ing@@ es@@ tion of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events on bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the expected frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparable medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparable medication . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment must be removed ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent can be reduced and the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( cannot be estimated from this data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the crus@@ hing index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents stro@@ ked more frequently than plac@@ ebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ p . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency was rarely reported on pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of the Pro@@ Active trial , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparable medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) , resulting in increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral Glu@@ cos@@ ystem in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients to be treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite the three @-@ month optim@@ ising period with insulin , were random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over one year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ etics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels seen in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d lowered values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ised , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma can normally be achieved 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness of the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ actively tagged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the average plasma elimination rate of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume enlar@@ ging with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent can be reduced and the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) induced higher inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epithel@@ ium .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased incidence of col@@ on tum@@ ours .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the marker &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the expected frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparable medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparable medication . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d were investigated . &quot;
in clinical trials over 1 year at Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study l@@ acked the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with ing@@ es@@ pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the marker &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summ@@ ari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients receiving settlement medication , increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparable medication . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to utilize the insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how good blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane has led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any other component .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ aph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to take out the packing supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were beyond the risks .
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily when a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
inj@@ ections must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly , for example , by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi @-@ phase , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin , insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin .
&quot; before trips , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to get the advice of his physician , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for any medication taken by them .
&quot; 4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in insufficient diabetes care , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can cause un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturb@@ ances of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ ult - Peri@@ pher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A quick recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of the blood sugar setting can however be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the body tissue occasionally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection point may arise a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to switch the inser@@ tion points within the injection range .
&quot; general diseases and complaints at the site occasionally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , sor@@ eness and ha@@ emat@@ oma can occur at the injection point ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system Occ@@ ul@@ atively - Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ ot@@ eur@@ ot@@ ic ede@@ ma , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impot@@ ence / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be gradually developed : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diab@@ etics should always have g@@ rief , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven assistant or given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active period is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of cle@@ av@@ age ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on the conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data does not allow any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane water bottle is extracted from the fridge - to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before being res@@ us@@ cep@@ ted according to the manual for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) or any other component .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; if two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin that is rapidly operating must be raised , then the amount of the long acting insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required during the change to acet@@ one in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before trips , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to get the advice of his physician , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; let the closing fl@@ ap of your Nov@@ o@@ Sheet finished pens always set up , if it is not in use to protect it from light . &quot;
remove the protective tape from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine Inj@@ ection needle • Use the protective fl@@ ap of a Nov@@ o@@ Fine Inj@@ ection needle • Use the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id Nov@@ o@@ leaf ( figure A ) • P@@ ull the large outer cap of the inj@@ ections needle and the inner cap of the inj@@ ections needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle to the top • kno@@ ck a couple of times with your finger against the cartridge .
&quot; if air bub@@ bles are present , they will collect them above in the cartridge • Wh@@ ile the injection needle continues upward , turn the cartridge in the direction of the arrow ( figure B ) • Wh@@ ile the injection needle continues upward , press the pressure button completely inside ( figure C ) • Now you have to leave the tip of the injection needle a drop of insulin . &quot;
• Rest@@ ore the cap again so that the digit 0 is compared to the met@@ ering mark ( figure D ) • Control whether the button is pressed completely .
&quot; if the pressure button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;

&quot; 107 • Not@@ ice the highest number you can see on the push button scale • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the set dose • If you set up a wrong dose , turn the cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; turn it until the pressure button is at the bottom and you will feel a resistance , then take the closing fl@@ ap and set it up again , that the 0 of the met@@ ering mark is over . &quot;
take care not to press the button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the pressure button pressed completely after the injection until the inj@@ ections needle has been pulled out of the skin .
&quot; it may be un@@ accurate • You can not set any dose which is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the balance scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use it to adjust or select your dose . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or gyp@@ sum ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ x crystals that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atism can still occur ; therefore , patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic will have further medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( 80 , 120 and 240 mg once daily ) was compared with that of a plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do medication ) and of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( 80 and 120 mg once daily ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients received 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily intake 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart disease in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in ur@@ anium deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently available tox@@ in no@@ des and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ essing bar is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney impair@@ ment , efficacy and safety were not fully investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents There is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since organ transplan@@ t recipients have no experience , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ emic heart disease or de@@ vic@@ ized heart failure is not recommended treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ essing drugs , it may result in acute rheum@@ atism during the course of the treatment because of the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ essing pi@@ eg@@ els first , ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues can be mobil@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; for example in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine occurs in rare cases so far that it occurs in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease during the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in the patients treated with Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before beginning of the Feb@@ u@@ ary procedure and in the subsequent course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was not carried out in Feb@@ u@@ ary ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ u@@ o@@ stat@@ s ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
&quot; Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at may be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in a study conducted with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the inclusion of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and caused a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies cannot be concluded for side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not result in direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o @-@ group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be established . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; adverse events ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ u@@ ary ost@@ at and which were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea and nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated simultaneously with Col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no severe skin erup@@ tions or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years long , 57 patients with up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all Feb@@ u@@ pol treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all or with a lower frequency in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies in phase 3 .

&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly ser@@ um har@@ n@@ al levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cancer value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the usual dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summ@@ arized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 versus 80 mg &quot;
the lowering of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ essing pi@@ eg@@ els at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
&quot; 509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1,5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um acid concentrations in subjects , despite their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) .
&quot; the data gathered in two years of the open extension study phase 3 showed that the continuous reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ al levels rose to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients required treatment against a shift in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a shift ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of the gir@@ th node size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the plaster k@@ not up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ g / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ o@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and were also received in patients who received al@@ lo@@ af@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma @-@ centered time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ portion@@ ately after administration of simple and multiple doses . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in percentage of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations was observed if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma cutting of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ens showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is created mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly Feb@@ u@@ ary ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ modified Feb@@ u@@ ary ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ of ⋅ h / ml in group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction also changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ rop@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after in@@ gest@@ ing multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ treated group , with approximately 11 @-@ times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and are considered ir@@ relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occ@@ ured , which accompanied by lowering the capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ chic@@ ine / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at may be used together with Col@@ chic@@ ine or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea and nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated simultaneously with Col@@ chic@@ ine . * * In clinical trials no severe skin erup@@ tions or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients with up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly ser@@ um har@@ n@@ al levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; the data gathered in two years of the open extension study phase 3 showed that the continuous reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ al levels rose to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients required treatment against a shift in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a shift ) . &quot;

&quot; liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;

&quot; the owner of permission for placing on the market has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , is ready before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP guidelines , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented to risk management systems for human medicinal products with the next peri@@ odic safety update report ( P@@ SUR ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk management activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) • upon request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of crystals is prevented and in this way a reduction of dis@@ comfort is achieved . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken , • If you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient of Feb@@ u@@ ary ost@@ at or any other component of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart failure or have or had an other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of a cancer illness or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disorder where too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood is located ) .
&quot; if you have a rheum@@ atism at the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , red@@ ness , heat sensation and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out case is termin@@ ated before you start with the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , in order to prevent a rheum@@ atism or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have received / apply other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
it is particularly important that you should consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicines that may arise one of the following substances since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may arise and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures . • Im@@ men@@ top@@ urine ( for treating the immune defence ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for treating as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood dil@@ lution in cardiac disease )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on the traffic stability and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; please take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC before consultation with your doctor , if it is known that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the individual week@@ days are printed on the back of the bli@@ ster packaging , so that you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot;
&quot; if you have in@@ visi@@ bly taken an over@@ dose , please contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , get it as soon as possible unless the next intake is just before . &quot;
&quot; if you break the intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , your ur@@ ic acid concentration can increase again , and your dis@@ comfort can wor@@ sen , because new Ur@@ inary crystals can form in your joints and kid@@ neys as well as their surroundings . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , in which there is a risk of low vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and Vitamin D3 can already be used separately from each other in medicines , which are approved in the European Union , the Company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE with regard to the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than with those who en@@ rolled Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also presented data that suggest that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , fl@@ utter ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ( swal@@ lowing ) , tap@@ ered abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic sensation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other component AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it should not be used in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who do not stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with an outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following hints are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hospit@@ alization ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point to potential es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to release the medicine after symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation , such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn . ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients not taking the medicine correctly , and / or following the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , rare ( after launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regim@@ en contains mainly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the rejection of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a max@@ illary surgical procedure , reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE next morning after notic@@ ing their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ om ) should also be adequately treated before the onset of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw was reported to patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports were reported by cancer patients , but were also reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , ser@@ um cal@@ ci@@ ums increased to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ol to vitamin D3 .
&quot; the main effect of 1,25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ D3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as regulation of ser@@ um calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ om , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ ate , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in o@@ steopor@@ otic individuals . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .

&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered from one or more spine frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to hold ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily in either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ rate by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;

&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the mean in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue following the intraven@@ ous dose of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After the intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the com@@ partments . &quot;
&quot; after the intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted during rats by the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems . &quot;

&quot; elimination In the dose of radio@@ actively selected vitamin D3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in cases after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients of pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the portion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available about it , however , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a somewhat elevated accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bones can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company submitted results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment period of one year ( for example , for example , investigating how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more recent studies were conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; trem@@ ors ( trem@@ ors ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , elevated blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium level of blood ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension , and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( In@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should not be used . &quot;
&quot; patients and physicians must be careful when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be appropriately adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below ) .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with a low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient does not allow oral intake of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be given . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection . oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further dose adjustments may later be required , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transplan@@ t . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended oral Initi@@ al dose must begin for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection once a day .
&quot; heart transplan@@ t For adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once daily . &quot;
&quot; in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , transplan@@ t recipients received Pro@@ gra@@ f in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood tal@@ low in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
&quot; since kidney function has no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ ometer of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um incre@@ ment levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the valley level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases while taking the aid of whole blood tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels .
it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ age Adjust@@ ment , Chang@@ es of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level in the blood is not exceeding 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the valley level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts is usually carried out in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with a heart transplan@@ ted patient at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided , or other plant remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is provided , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur in Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infection , liquid contamination and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision disturb@@ ances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose contain , is present in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special care . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while offering substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal decay . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us effect on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions on contrac@@ eption measures are particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend its half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of tests on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , supervision of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effects of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

&quot; cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ l@@ act@@ lic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .

175 l@@ ung@@ transplan@@ ted patients with 4@@ 75 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ as transplan@@ t and were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 630 cases after a col@@ on transplan@@ t .
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies reported observations in the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was applied to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during a 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rates after one year amounted to 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to develop a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a study , the incidence of the emergence of a Bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multic@@ entr@@ al study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who were treated at the same time as a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t that received a random@@ ised trial tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was afterwards to achieve the desired level of water from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

&quot; this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly through the bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients , which were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( caused by the lack of factor VIII , inn@@ ate blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ate is used to treat hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII failure , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced using a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of the human factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; the main study evaluated the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic periods with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG approval for the transport of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ defect according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events the factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plas@@ m@@ ist ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the course of the treatment , to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections , an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma tor@@ ch is recommended . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII will not be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ or values it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the dosage speed should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) to factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII @-@ directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; in the largest number of patients , A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of each patient ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation was maintained throughout time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was found . &quot;
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study comprised 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ AN@@ C inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII .
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms reported to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the incidence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ act@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency unknown ) . &quot;
the factor VIII can be activated as a co factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VIII activity &lt; 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has still assessed the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorization holder should apply another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited shared the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) it . &quot;
it is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in virus is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene existing in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the sub@@ structure , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he had asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the documents submitted at the beginning , the CH@@ MP on Day 120 creates a list of questions sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours brings benefits to the patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , through an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nose ) in patients with nas@@ al bleeding ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 or over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are termin@@ ated . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be detected on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all h@@ ay fever symptoms apart from the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who alone received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , anor@@ ex@@ ia ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a nar@@ cot@@ ic glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases , including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension caused by stroke ) , or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union to the Company SP Europe . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed in whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing it or ch@@ ew@@ ing it ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time during long @-@ term use . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , vul@@ erg@@ oline , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , n@@ az@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient @-@ collective and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treating hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck construction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences could be detected between the patients with the Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither is a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , does not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ ting properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases it can come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which may result in impair@@ ment of traffic stability or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturb@@ ances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is especially prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhes@@ ion sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight sliding , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , whereby 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine via the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al surgery , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine via the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes of administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of the lor@@ at@@ adin are poor@@ ly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was equivalent to exposure after receiving an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , however , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination did not have any greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works , before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms , preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , ongoing or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a of the ab@@ err@@ ing drug Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in that is contained in this drug . &quot;
&quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ side stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to a nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ) , a bladder neck , bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ ms in the medical history ( breathing difficulty due to a var@@ ic@@ ity of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate size or problems with the liver , kid@@ neys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze following symptoms or diseases : • Blood pressure • Heart ch@@ asing , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nau@@ sea and head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when applying in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or de@@ compos@@ ing attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should notify your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of blood sugar , thirst , fatigue , head@@ ache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was very rare reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ icks , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , diar@@ rho@@ ea , muscular pains , diar@@ rho@@ ea , diar@@ rho@@ ea , diar@@ rho@@ ea and cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in altogether eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies to patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by determining the changing of the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance of the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( number of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the treatment of symptom scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience in clinical trials for the efficacy of the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( incidence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the previous disease process and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms of the symptoms .
&quot; in the case of persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the allergy period . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected during clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol have not increased the performance effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be informed , however , that in very rare cases it can come to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which may result in impair@@ ment of traffic stability or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in those treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ ha@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ sel@@ ector on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight line , including the rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the eti@@ ology of the different forms and chronic patients can be easily rec@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; since the hi@@ stam@@ ine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that in addition to chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , dis@@ infection leads to an improvement of the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ance considerably as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study comparable to patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant ag@@ gregation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither is a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ clinical studies carried out with the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin , with a similar degree of exposure to the lor@@ at@@ adin , have no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; color@@ ant film ( contains l@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ x@@ yl@@ ate , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ mine ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( includes hy@@ pro@@ sel@@ ess , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see under section 4.4 ) and that no data is available to support a treatment of infectious hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
&quot; about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age , Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is constra@@ ined and experienced a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years with limited metabolism is identical to that in children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed .
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ I@@ som@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected during clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol are not ampli@@ fied by reducing alcohol &apos;s performance ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in those treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) .
&quot; children between 1 and 11 years old , who were eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily dis@@ comfort dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are similar in adults and children the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated in adults .
&quot; as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 m@@ g. daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
controlled clinical studies were observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ ors in clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the intake of alcohol was not caused by increasing alcohol @-@ induced power imp@@ aired or increased drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and you@@ thful patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; the dis@@ semination of this limited met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation in children from 2 to 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , which are constra@@ ined . &quot;
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients in the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded . &quot;

&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dosage of the ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ism must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ erial Tablets , than in those treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine were used . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was used for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily .
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight sliding , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;

there are limited experience in clinical trials for the efficacy of the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tray is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets during treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets turned out to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ism for the inclusion of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clinical trial was performed . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight sliding , including rein@@ forcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ semination of this poor@@ ly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was however not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg , Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate , form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt pills support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 years . &quot;

overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melt tray yiel@@ ded that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical applications .
&quot; the safety of the lost lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which is reduced to a limited extent , is identical to that in children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar in the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine Solution . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see under section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
controlled clinical studies were observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can also be found in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ semination of this limited met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution to inhal@@ ing the same concentration of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no bio @-@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
&quot; in different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients in the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s in@@ verse to prevent cavi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine administration , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; physical &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies that are faster in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; the membrane sleeve of the virus was then cle@@ ans@@ ed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that det@@ ects the human body as a body alien ) , cle@@ ans@@ ed and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scale of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA Gui@@ delines for Pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a clinical exam and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for inclusion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral drug the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice a day , which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ tro@@ ase depends on the body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the HIV @-@ amount in the blood while taking in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; however , AIDS cannot cure the damage of the immune system and therefore also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase inhibit@@ ed with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with 206 adults , previously used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of the viral load following the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies per ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral load , however , with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase inhibit@@ ors the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks than in the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and fatigue . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are just as degra@@ ded as A@@ gro@@ in and are det@@ ri@@ mental in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of a li@@ po@@ cr@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( dying of bone tissue ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally permitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and a solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the extra supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg of body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ thma in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; herbal preparations , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal development .
&quot; for the case of an anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis demonstrate increased incidence of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cc@@ or@@ tic oids , which are metabol@@ ised via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and supp@@ ressing the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of atri@@ ate with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines which cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot;
&quot; in the case of patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to the reduced plasma gas of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if there are also still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col@@ o@@ col@@ o@@ co@@ ction of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in duration 5 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medicines that were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections may result in severe clinical condition or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not simultaneously be given with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines , whose active substances are primarily used via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compens@@ ate the reduced plasma gas levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um level of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced through the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s Wort , the am@@ pl@@ ab mirror is and , if possible , to check the viral load and reduce the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , on the other hand , by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and harm@@ fulness of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ Min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there has been no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use ast@@ ero@@ id in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the anta@@ sizing component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggests that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in may reduce the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma gas . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ag@@ ro@@ phy in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma tor@@ ches of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole at once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole compared to the value observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in interaction with A@@ war@@ ase . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with ag@@ ro@@ phy .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption dys@@ functions . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va known as an enzyme inhibit@@ or ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas from am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , rock di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentration and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma bar increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of ast@@ ero@@ id with k@@ night cavi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cc@@ or@@ tic oids is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced enh@@ ancements of the plasma gas are expected to be administered at the same time . &quot;
&quot; since plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to My@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine with am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to monitor the therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased while offering am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used along with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while being treated with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution at the same time . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ i@@ dium symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dosage is adjusted when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother versus the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , however it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passed in humans into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the inc@@ ision in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most adverse events related to the A@@ gener@@ ase therapy were mild to moderate , coming up early and rarely resulted in treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the ing@@ es@@ tion of A@@ war@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were classified by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory les@@ ions ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ph@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin erup@@ tions were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontane@@ ously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dos@@ ed p@@ inion ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory les@@ ions ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed ri@@ k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very common . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag and g@@ ag pol@@ - poly@@ protein stages with the result of an education un@@ ripe , not infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the link between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r stain@@ ed treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients receiving 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously untreated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 trial and their pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg ri@@ m@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations occurred : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M with a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations may be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that exp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( dividing points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ances , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ spr@@ ing@@ ra@@ - half@@ way scheme failed ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and T@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; early canc@@ elation of a delayed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can be det@@ ri@@ mental to subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose ri@@ p@@ ples . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ prem@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ sub@@ standard threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged between 2 and 18 years , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase was used to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on this data treatment optimisation should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral dosing the mean duration ( T@@ max ) is up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore , minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted penetration of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing intervals depends on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from a solution of 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ generic capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a mil@@ limeter base .
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney function disorder may be minor on the elimination of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these regim@@ ens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas used in male animals occ@@ ured in dos@@ ages that were correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there is little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test at rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes were neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , clinical studies did not observe any significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ war@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the extra supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg of body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver function disorder , patients with severe liver function disorder should be contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines which cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be termin@@ ated in duration 27 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , on the other hand , by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ Min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose of 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , rock di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine , ni@@ m@@ pine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma bar increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ ti@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ Min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother versus the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the inc@@ ision in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the optimisation of therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosing intervals depends on the total @-@ drug concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state over the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the effect of kidney impair@@ ment may be minor on the elimination of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in male animals ben@@ ign hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , there is little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test at rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that the metabol@@ ising path@@ ways are not fully developed in young , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic solution for inclusion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of the &quot; &quot; A@@ generic &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion has not been demonstrated in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and a solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to consume ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ y@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination will be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose @-@ adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col@@ o@@ col@@ o@@ cer@@ ol , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for inf@@ ants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this drug and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines which cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be termin@@ ated for duration when a r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug and 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a patients ( type A and B ) , treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ mar@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , on the other hand , by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentration and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturb@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
on the basis of the data on 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors significantly higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , however it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passed in humans into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the inc@@ ision in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the ing@@ es@@ tion of A@@ war@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of underlying disease . &quot;
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r stain@@ ed treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
&quot; early canc@@ elation of a delayed 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can be det@@ ri@@ mental to subsequent treatment . &quot;
62 Based on this data should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large volume volume as well as an un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted penetration of am@@ spr@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects is unclear .
&quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development . &quot;

&quot; - If any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
your doctor will normally advise you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of A@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resist@@ ence test and your treatment history carried out by your doctor .
inform your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above conditions or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
&quot; if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( Boo@@ ster@@ y ) , make sure you have read the use information about Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully before the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
there are also no adequate information to recommend the application of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effectiveness of children aged 4 to 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with Other medicinal products , &quot; before you start taking ap@@ ache . &quot;

dosage of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg twice a day together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; thus , it is very important that you take the full daily dose that your doctor has prescribed . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken more amounts of A@@ gro@@ ase than you should , if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of A@@ gener@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using the &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution was not covered by prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors previously untreated patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
for the application of low doses of p@@ inion ( usually applied to strengthen the effect &#91; Boo@@ ster@@ y &#93; of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules ) along with A@@ general ase solution to intake can not be given dosage recommendations .
&quot; to take the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r solution , or additionally take Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col during the ing@@ es@@ tion of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase should not be taken ) . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will probably be aware of side effects associated with the prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col@@ col@@ ine of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , especially if you have a kidney or liver illness . &quot;

&quot; Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may contain additional Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col , while taking ap@@ ache does not take ( see A@@ gener@@ ase should not be taken ) . &quot;
important information about certain other components of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take the solution to intake contains propylene gly@@ col which can cause side effects in high doses .
&quot; Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col can cause a number of side effects including sei@@ zur@@ es , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , heart r@@ f and the reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ gener@@ ase may not be taken , Special care when taking A@@ gener@@ ase is necessary precau@@ tions ) . &quot;

&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , fatigue , vom@@ iting , paraly@@ sis skin r@@ ash ( red@@ ness , bub@@ bles or it@@ ching ) - occasionally , the skin r@@ ash can be serious nature and you can force you to break the intake of this drug . &quot;
&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and in the face , a fat @-@ taking on the stomach and in other internal organs , breast enlargement and fatty tissue in the neck ( &quot; &quot; Sti@@ ern@@ acken &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the other components are Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ ye@@ th@@ ylene gly@@ col 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , su@@ cro@@ cin @-@ sodium , sodium chlori@@ de , natural pep@@ per@@ mint flavor , lev@@ om@@ enth@@ ol , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital area , Al@@ dar@@ a is up to a maximum of 16 weeks weekly . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inner to apply to the skin areas affected so that it can remain on the skin enough long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated six weeks long and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo had either daily or five times a week .
the primary indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions may limit the effectiveness and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) to apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has been continued until all visible f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces have disappeared in the genital or Peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered if intensive local inflammation reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces infected in skin area , until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
there should be a reduction in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take a atten@@ uation between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily routine was carried out , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a leading stri@@ k@@ tur were observed . &quot;
&quot; when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; until now , no clinical experiences are available to treat I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ aneous appropri@@ ated funds for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital and Peri@@ anal area . &quot;
&quot; limited data point to an increased rate of influ@@ xes in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine Cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group in regard to elimination of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair @-@ attachment was not investigated . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after conclusion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made for several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates available for more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; no clinical experiences are available in patients with rec@@ ci@@ dal and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine application for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions occur normally in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream . &quot;
&quot; if local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not produce direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor after multiple top@@ ical application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been reached , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequent contribut@@ ors and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most commonly reported and likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ creme from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , most likely , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in the context of the side effect , were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) in these studies . &quot;
adverse events given by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ creme @-@ treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the review , the evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream common to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / shed ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the review , the evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sh@@ orth@@ and formation ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) was detected at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental unique oral recording of 200 mg im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
3 efficacy studies in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies showed that the efficacy with regard to a complete healing of the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
&quot; in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces healed completely ; this was in 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) . &quot;
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in five @-@ term use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data obtained from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ opic ac@@ ne les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ coun@@ table scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clin@@ ically healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the indications of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be demonstrated in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated obvious half @-@ value was approximately 10@@ times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ value after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
&quot; the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was low in the age of 6 @-@ 12 years , comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four months study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat duc@@ ts , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with mal@@ ign@@ ant administration on three days per week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the point of application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not presum@@ ed , a risk for the human being is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with minimal U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; - If any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; if untreated , it may lead to de@@ positions , especially in the face - therefore , early detection and treatment are important . &quot;
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to a great deal of solar radiation during their lifetime .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in case of flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection . &quot;
&quot; if you have previously used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about before proceeding with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream only when the area to be treated after a previous medi@@ cam@@ ent or operative treatment is cured . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in case of acci@@ dental contact , remove the cream by flus@@ hing with water . no more cream than your doctor orders you . o Do not apply more cream than your doctor prescri@@ bes you . o If reactions occur at the treated place that will give you strong dis@@ comfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cl@@ ung , you can continue treatment . o inform your doctor if they have no normal blood pattern &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling of the skin or difficulty in the re@@ traction of the fores@@ kin can be expected . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or inside the anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
if you have intercourse with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital area intercourse is the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not previously ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , because it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine enters into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin place with the ti@@ lt and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
&quot; men with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area under it ( see section 2 , What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) . &quot;
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks , a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream is applied for 5 days a week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects ( with more than 1 out of 10 patients expected ) Frequ@@ ent side effects ( with less than 1 out of 100 patients expect ) rare side effects ( with less than 1 of 1,000 patients expected ) Very rare side effects ( with less than 1 out of 10,000 patients expected ) &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist / pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue using the cream , wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a lower number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infection ; it can cause you to create a blue spot faster , or it may cause de@@ formation . &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of the patients ) , burning ( 26 % of the patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , lighter skin reactions take place within approximately 2 weeks following the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes to the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sh@@ orth@@ and , skin destruction , bli@@ sters , der@@ m@@ atitis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients suffer from changes to the application place ( bleeding , inflammation , wound @-@ secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , scor@@ ching and scar@@ ring , ul@@ cer@@ ation , heat sensation or dis@@ comfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , red@@ ness , facial swelling , ul@@ c@@ ous ker@@ at@@ ose , red@@ ness , facial swelling , ul@@ c@@ ers , limbs , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for treatment therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damaging it . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements difficult , decreased pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart and eye disease . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ plen@@ ishment devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the magnitude of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion point . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will examine all new information that may be known each year , and that this summary will be updated if necessary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. the approval of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese hamster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should be closely monitored closely , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only occur in an appropriate clinical environment where re @-@ loading facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase III study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a reaction @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction , it must be cau@@ ti@@ ously prec@@ eded after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with drugs ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) to minimize the potential incidence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in the case of a light or medium @-@ severe inf@@ usion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
&quot; experimental studies do not result in direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to the mother &apos;s milk compared to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms not to satisfy . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly prescribed as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase III study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe MR@@ I @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desired drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged less than 5 years , with predominantly heavy start @-@ up form and a treatment period of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dosage ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic version , whereby the patients at the age of 5 came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic conversion ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) , no demonstr@@ able antibodies were detected by radio@@ immun@@ oph@@ ag@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay in 13 / 45 patients , among them 3 patients , in which it never came to servo conversion . &quot;
&quot; patients with lacking low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase III study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal and low neutr@@ alising inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies does not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
&quot; after IV inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is removed quickly from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ sis omes , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ Phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study which showed the whole disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the value expected , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage modification of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the in@@ ability to be treated in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not statisti@@ cally significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
from the 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study .
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the hetero@@ geneous condition of the disease between the patients who have been taken into account by using a combined end @-@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes across five effectiveness variables ( an expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , movement range of the shoulder joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was observed in general an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag@@ - Refle@@ ction in the urine week 22 in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the average follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development velocity , whereas in the older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dosage ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosing regim@@ en with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate every new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in elderly and less affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in a single dose , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data does not allow any particular dangers to humans . &quot;

&quot; very common ( occurrence with more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache • nau@@ sea • abdominal pain • r@@ ash • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • E@@ ating • F@@ ill • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • response to the inf@@ usion point &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate every new information available annually , and if necessary , the packaging fee will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to store , provided the di@@ lution was carried out under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • to determine the number of cut@@ ters to be dil@@ uted after body weight of the individual patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , &quot; which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should be treated with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dosage should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ eds thus s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells from sharing .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to take in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than with the comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to appro@@ ve A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each side bottle must be raised with 4.2 ml , 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a 25 mg / ml solution . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from a cookie bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is used in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with single @-@ cell advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for over@@ weight plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given on the day before and on the day of the p@@ emet@@ ric gift and on the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of p@@ emet@@ re@@ eds , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third reference cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood @-@ picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity of previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the instructions in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ers a hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ ic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above in comparison to patients at the age of 65 there is an elevated side efficiency risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not need to dose doses which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ by value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ases of the upper limit value ( in Ab@@ - Essen@@ ce of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored in terms of bone @-@ mark@@ edly and can not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ alization of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils once again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutr@@ alization of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ein@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia has been imp@@ aired if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed patients need to be required to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy . ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients who have been intended for treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ emin@@ ate before p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasions when this active ingredient was usually administered in combination with a different cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is through p@@ emet@@ re@@ aks , men should be advised before the treatment session to obtain advice regarding the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) lead to reduced p@@ emet@@ ric secre@@ tion with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is provided when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be applied high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on day of therapy and reduction 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days prior to therapy should be avoided at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; it should not be used during pregnancy , unless required and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; given the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity through p@@ emet@@ re@@ aks , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the closure of the sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ eds goes over into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and the random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed - and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to Phase 2 of three single emet@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ other@@ api@@ aries ( n = 164 ) , except for neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and well pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .

clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients who were random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed were covered :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed were included :

&quot; clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
&quot; from clinical studies , patients with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed @-@ treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
it was reported on cases of acute kidney failure in p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before or after their emet@@ ric treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ thesis which performs its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important fol@@ lic@@ ular metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed acts as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ l@@ atin syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ amide ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) which are fol@@ lic@@ ular key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ized , easy @-@ blind phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , showed that with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin patients treated a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 months extended survival compared to those patients who were only d@@ elt with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving investig@@ ational medicines in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was demonstrated in the application of the Lun@@ aph@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared with the all@@ ot@@ ted C@@ is@@ pl@@ a tin @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in control .
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ized , open phase III trial with ALI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat populations n = 283 ) and 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell to favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plat@@ epi@@ th@@ eli@@ ac hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data of a random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment were similar to doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q Population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ prem@@ acy of ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination against gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; mean P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination of ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of NSC@@ LC Hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the overall population a Statisti@@ cal significant for non @-@ su@@ prem@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ sub@@ standard limit of 1,17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin require less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic trans@@ f@@ usions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the patients required the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0,@@ 004 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0,0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed after application as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ors in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the prescribed dose will be recovered within 24 hours after application , in the urine . &quot;

&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the specimen . &quot;
it is used in over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their physician or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot remove some fats in the food , thereby making about a quarter of the fats eaten with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who participated in the All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no loss of weight could be observed for patients .
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with step lab@@ eling , bow@@ string , o@@ ily / o@@ ily stool , ab@@ duct o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( which does not have sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the Company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve the placing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be applied in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
All@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 as there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ b@@ ated , older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• Dur@@ able treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • P@@ reg@@ n@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a high fat meal or fatty food .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic must be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dose of this drug must be adapted .
&quot; it is recommended to take supplementary pregnancy @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures , in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study on the interactions of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma is observed . &quot;
&quot; in the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary vitamin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the dose of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers who received Or@@ list@@ at at the same time were observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side @-@ effects identified after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of in@@ definite magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to con@@ ges@@ tion with regard to potential or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal weight and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , no side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at were reported . &quot;
based on studies on humans and animals it can be assumed from a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the li@@ fit properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is used in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ stro and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ a .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 cover the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the alter@@ ation of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg @-@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 . in general with therapeutic doses not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be spor@@ adic and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation .
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients , which was given the minimal system@@ ically res@@ or@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting of the N @-@ form @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified which represent approximately 42 % of total plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data does not allow any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , will be applied and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you might not have reduced fat content in the diet at this time . &quot;
&quot; you can learn about the standard fat content of your favourite foods for a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions they normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you will exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended fat evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to eat per meal , not to take it in the form of a high @-@ fat main dish or a cl@@ ums@@ y dessert , as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as an indication on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume maximum per day . &quot;
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; please refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories you are suitable for . • Because of the mode of action of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss while at the same time decrease the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not walk only little or no , stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal daily , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30 - 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and to adhere to it as well . • Stim@@ ulation is a nutrition journal with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
&quot; the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials , which can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fat @-@ duc@@ ed and give guidelines to become physically active . &quot;
&quot; in conjunction with a program tailored to your type of weight loss , this information can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the regular trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ) .
&quot; the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , because the effects in this age group do not have enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three major studies involving 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong resp@@ . trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong cause of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate cause of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company &apos;s Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd to distribute Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in heavily em@@ itted chemotherapy because of cancer and to prevent nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ itting chemotherapy because of cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored closely after injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ bab@@ y@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is offered while offering Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bited the activity of the five chemotherapy regim@@ ens examined against tum@@ ours ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous offering of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , de@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common adverse events observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar occur@@ ences of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to be observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in an al@@ op@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value 7.3 hours ) received on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study showed a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , received intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following the findings of pre @-@ clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption following intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma centri@@ city a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentrations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the total dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the medi@@ an ( ± SD ) measured in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular carcin@@ oma patients ran@@ ged from 42 ± 34 % between Day 1 and Day 5 .
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved with a daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days was comparable ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the dispos@@ ing of 0.75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated through the kid@@ neys , and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron metabolism .
&quot; elimination After a 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified agent made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver function disorder , the termin@@ ale elimination of the elimination and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can extend the action lifetime . &quot;
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about the 30@@ times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every day for two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , side @-@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ cord ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , however , not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is considered low for humans . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the failure of approval for the placing of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease called viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue indicates damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are increased . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon demonstrated data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study for hepatitis C patients , Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s efficacy was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference medicine . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment were received ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the CH@@ MP to fail to deny the right to traffic ?
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was again ret@@ ard@@ ant in more patients than in reference medicine ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the study used in the study investig@@ ates the question to what extent the drug provides an immune response ( i.e. the body produces antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it may be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected pati@@ ent@@ ations ( cracks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this kind of infection . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was termin@@ ated after the end of the treatment .
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in plac@@ ebo responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at skin dogs , about 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ stu@@ ffed cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or of infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections predomin@@ ate against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little in@@ firm@@ ations , scrap@@ es or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the European Union to operate Al@@ tar@@ go in the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , treatment will be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection will begin . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogens or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies with secondary open wounds , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of infected space after 2 to 3 days treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical methods on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma centri@@ city that has been reached in humans after top@@ ical application on sk@@ id skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 Acc@@ ording to the simultaneous dose of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % by healthy adult men .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction sto@@ ic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate with regard to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast@@ feeding continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with surface skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the meeting place , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
&quot; the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by means of interaction at a certain binding location of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances . &quot;
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appear obj@@ ection@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was launched daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and on the skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in children from 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ id skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism of the in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower part of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies of oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid gland changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro analysis on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ id skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were detected in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fo@@ etus and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;

&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated place show , you should end the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not use any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly ordered by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; when the o@@ int@@ ment is out of sight on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if ail@@ ments occur . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile band@@ age or a gaz@@ er , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cover containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and fifteen years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix will be used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensures that the vacc@@ ination plan can end from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or -@@ B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , as it can fight against disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the currently licensed vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and the currently licensed vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ egu@@ i children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 @-@ month intervals between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix showed between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month intervals between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , appetite deficiency , pain on the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ eness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic di@@ mm@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ eal vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies have been observed in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals , who have responded to a Hepatitis A vaccine , need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they are also protected with no more det@@ ectable antibodies by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ inations may be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ ocular injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal result , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it may occur in these cases after intr@@ amus@@ cular administration to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ e- , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - M@@ umps R@@ öt@@ tle vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there may be insufficient immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this wor@@ ding in adults , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ernal g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency that was observed in earlier Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were given to 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity based on a comp@@ uted dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a comp@@ uted basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 39.@@ 1 % in subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vaccine cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects reported that the Ambi@@ rix had received , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of sever@@ ity was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. , over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine ) . &quot;
frequency pronounced pain and fatigue was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of impact , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed when administration with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed . &quot;
&quot; however , for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the share of impot@@ ence , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units of formal hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally significant . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted with impot@@ ence at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for Anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three cans . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 subjects whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was sel@@ ectable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after receiving the 3 dose vaccine higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which is achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; for individuals who were between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine scheme . &quot;
&quot; the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that , after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
in a clinical trial at 12 - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine scheme in the 0 @-@ 12 month vaccine scheme .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life coinci@@ des with the refres@@ her vacc@@ ination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ e- , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ orting to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in waters contaminated by sewage . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ inations , ( although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or ill at the ino@@ cul@@ ation point ) , a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease . &quot;
&quot; protection against other infections affecting the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If you / your child already showed an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; an allergic reaction can manifest itself by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , difficulty breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have already an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. if you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the normal dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per ino@@ cul@@ ation dose ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection against the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take more medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or have received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or have been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they can be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you have already showed an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ planted cans ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at the ind@@ entation or red@@ ness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches • Appeti@@ zers
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 im@@ planted cans ) : swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ aded • g@@ astro@@ intestinal complaints
&quot; additional side effects , which are very rare days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 contaminated cans ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include loc@@ alized or expanded not@@ ches , which can be it@@ ching or pale @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye @-@ part and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data that has become known since the initial approval of the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP indicated that the value @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix left positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix has been put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ exhaus@@ tive enz@@ ym@@ atic or hyper@@ ammon@@ ema En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; Ammon@@ ite is divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered by a g@@ astro@@ pod into the stomach of the leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of the leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia did not compare with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste im@@ balance , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , uncomfortable body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disturb@@ ances of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because , due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this drug was prescribed . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzymes is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
patients with a late @-@ stage form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first breath of life ) is then an indication of the use when an@@ am@@ n@@ esis is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite enc@@ ephal@@ opathy .
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ low disorders AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early in@@ contin@@ ence deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ drow@@ ning bam@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ atal syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to get ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ ylene but@@ yr@@ ate occurs over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased neur@@ ons decreased . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tic@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ our top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound formed by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram consumed sodium bis@@ phen@@ ylene can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is provided early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ anti@@ ated and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
&quot; by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen removal ( sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival , but even in these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; patients with a late @-@ stage form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scri@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , amounted to 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ ate @-@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atically with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ ate yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after receiving a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ ylene but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis following individual return as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ ind@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous sodium bis@@ phen@@ ylene ( up to 2@@ g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ c@@ lic compounds or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bies , Phen@@ yl@@ ate yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in the next morning after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , repeated with sodium bis@@ phen@@ ylene ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma gas were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kid@@ neys .
&quot; following the results of mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium bis@@ phen@@ ylene had no cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children that can not yet swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or over a g@@ astro@@ pod or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early in@@ contin@@ ence deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ drow@@ ning bam@@ yl@@ ase .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if atten@@ ders were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ ate yr@@ at ) before birth , it came to les@@ ions in the pyram@@ idal cells of the c@@ ort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tic@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ our top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the elimination of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , sodium bis@@ phen@@ ylene but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur . &quot;
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate in gran@@ ulate form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium bis@@ phen@@ ylene but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the sti@@ cky waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins . &quot;
&quot; if you have studied laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as sodium bis@@ phen@@ ylene may affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as the medicine can go into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , detection of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disturb@@ ances and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or the emergency doctor of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out at you , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ ylene but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS on equal single doses of or@@ ally or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for instance in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; st@@ - le@@ verage &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value at electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a certain dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year overall as usual . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in relation to all indicators as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
September 2004 the European Commission issued a permit for the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ ation dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one of these directly following intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI surgery is planned . &quot;
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) short@@ ens to less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ ting of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ed and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before application and administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously before the application . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ valent ret@@ ina against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us@@ o@@ dosage can be tested again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after giving the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In case of severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ dependent patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intraven@@ ous administration of in@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• severe hyper@@ tension or increased risk of bleeding due to disturb@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din the majority of arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may perform bleeding during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the case of patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine reg@@ ains that level before treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ology parameters are regularly monitored regularly . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post @-@ nat@@ al development are inadequate ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as in patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than with male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined following the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ id plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an A@@ cu@@ ity severe hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or hem@@ at@@ oma of ≥ 3 g / dl without apparent hem@@ ost@@ asis , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , which occ@@ ured in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot;
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with a bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine in 6000 patients who have under@@ gone a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side @-@ effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed together according to system groups in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine is immediately termin@@ ated and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ ite inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the Ani@@ on@@ enb@@ ind@@ ent region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in a cl@@ ot@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because thro@@ mb@@ in on the part slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;

&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ ol@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
in the arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography in 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ went within 72 hours of angi@@ ography . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as continuous inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from the human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter active life than a short @-@ acting insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body of insulin can not be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin drops per six months . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months compared to 0.30 % compared to 0.30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
September 2004 the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole of the European Union .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion into the abdominal cavity . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose levels and the reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements in patients can be reduced with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can change the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ related diabetes , may result in hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when switching the treatment regim@@ en .
&quot; substances that can increase blood glucose levels and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ etics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic agents such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ ine and spare @-@ pin , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ balance may be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproduction toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in enters into human breast milk but generally insulin occurs neither in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed in clinical studies are listed , sorted by system organ@@ - and group@@ ed according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data ) . &quot;

severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person or treated by a physician using intraven@@ ous glucose .
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus showed insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic relevance dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ es@@ tival effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a sub@@ di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate rise in glu@@ cos@@ es@@ tival effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data was apparent that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ pran@@ di@@ cal gly@@ c@@ emic control is achieved , like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was frozen 2 minutes before the meal , a better postoperative control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ emic control is achieved like with human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
