<seg id="4">"it is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. When thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elevation) with periods of normal sentiment."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent multiple episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when oral taking of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used to inhale or to treat the smelting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing pills."</seg>
<seg id="9">"patients who simultaneously take other medicines, which are exactly as same as Abilify, should be adjusted to the dose of Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances which allow communication of nerve cells among themselves."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazl is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalizing the brain activity, thereby preventing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its reoccurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">Efficacy of Abilify to prevent the reoccurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study, the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent reoccurrence in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with bilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">Efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared with a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest associated with Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body resorbs the melt tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg gave a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced in four of five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the reoccurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of bilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled access), trauma (constant movement), sedation, nausea (nausea), vomiting, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, who mostly talked about treatment with Aripiprazl, prevail against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with biochemical episodes in bipolar I disorder, when oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of Abilify to the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were related to treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify amounts to 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group, a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the aria prazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no elevated suicide risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyscinesis occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazl."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if patients with a abilify treat signs and symptoms of late dynesia, consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a brain, or unequivocal high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of urine, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be aborted."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in with Aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic drugs, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs, which allow direct comparisons."</seg>
<seg id="46">"polyurethane, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, respectively an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazl, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore, similar dosage reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolisers can result in the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations in Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensively metabolisers.</seg>
<seg id="53">"if one considers the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore, similar dosage reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of abilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in aripiprazole concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethyl morphine / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethyl)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data layer for safety in humans and due to the concerns caused by animal reproduction, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side-effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>

<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazole showed a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathias, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of eps was 19% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under topical zapine therapy."</seg>

<seg id="70">"increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti-psychotic medication include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dynesia and varicose, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, intentional or intentional overdosing with Aripiprazl alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazl; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazl has a high plasma cutting bandaging."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is suspected that the effectiveness of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity for the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and for serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a-receptor as well as an even affinity for the dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I-disorder Aripiprazl showed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I-disorder Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo- and actively-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a performance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic regimens, the accompanying therapy with aripiprazole yielded superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>

<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripiprazl, the N-dealkying is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl in extensive metabolisers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazl, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A variation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics gave no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different radiant liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional safety spharmacology studies, toxicity with repeated administration, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not identify any particular danger to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans so that they have limited or no importance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects covered a dose-dependent adrenal rince (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times of the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81times of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazl are not more than 6% of concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of ape, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility."</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">"in addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients) can be applied, which cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose."</seg>

<seg id="753">"this means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced, whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1,000 patients the efficacy of acetone was tested in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with sulfa drugs, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how good the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which makes it possible to reduce blood sugar levels when using dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl glue in lower HbA1c values decreased by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients who additionally took placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypogethesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that actos in the framework of a monotherapy (in the sole use) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with which metformin is not indicated.</seg>

<seg id="864">"Actaphane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to utilize the insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">"after 12 weeks, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, indicating how good blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="866">Actaphane has led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror suggesting that blood sugar levels have been reduced similarly to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actaphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to human insulin (rDNA) or any other component.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of acetaphane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the complete list is to take out the packing supplement)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of acetaphane in the treatment of diabetes were beyond the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">"October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the transport of Actaphane in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily when a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">Injections must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can perceive the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, bi-phase, long acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin, insulin analog) and / or production method (due to recombinant DNA versus insulin origin) can cause a change in dosage."</seg>
<seg id="875">"if a dose adjustment is required when switching to acetaphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion."</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">"before trips, which go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to get the advice of his physician, as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times."</seg>

<seg id="886">"however, hypoglycemia can be gradually developed: • Easy hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sugary foods."</seg>
<seg id="887">"diabetics should always have grief, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemia with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven assistant or given intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect starts within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active period is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>

<seg id="1655">"aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, through an allergy to pollen caused inflammation of the nose) in patients with nasal bleeding (clogged nose)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents aged 12 or over, the recommended dose of aerinaze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are terminated."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be detected on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard scale, how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"when considering all hay fever symptoms apart from the constipation of the nose, patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who alone received pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving the desloratadine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth dryness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), anorexia (sleepiness), somnolence (sleepiness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to disloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active substances or Loratadine (another medicine for the treatment of allergies)."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narcotic glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases, including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension caused by stroke), or have a risk of a hemorrhagic stroke."</seg>

<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the use time to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time during long-term use."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper airways, the treatment can be continued as monotherapy if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"as aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is due to the alphamimetic activity of combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, lisurid, Cabergoline, vulergoline, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, nazolin etc.)."</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient-collective and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">"patients must be informed that treating hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or reinforcement of headaches) must be dismissed."</seg>

<seg id="1681">"the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither is a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"the harmlessness of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, does not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstricting properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"patients should be informed, however, that in very rare cases it can come to a lightheadedness which may result in impairment of traffic stability or the ability to operate machinery."</seg>
<seg id="1686">"symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letteries."</seg>

<seg id="1689">"these include both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion smolecular P-selectin to endothelial cells."</seg>
<seg id="1690">"in a single dose study with adults, Desloratine showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight sliding, including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying."</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"the oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause further sympathomimetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of CNS arousal."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"there were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"in both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine via the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal surgery, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine via the 2-week treatment period."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"as part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is demonstrable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"after the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of the loratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratine and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"as part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of the loratadin are poorly metabolised."</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine was equivalent to exposure after receiving an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"based on the conventional safety spharmacology studies, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproduction toxicity, however, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"the combination did not have any greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrin."</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that is to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"a flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man, because people have no immunity (no protection) against it."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"after the vaccine administration, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as" "physical" "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"as a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies that are faster in contact with a flu virus."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"the membrane sleeve of the virus was then cleansed with the" surface antigens "(proteins on the membrane surface that detects the human body as a body alien), cleansed and used as a component of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">"as a result, the scale of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA Guidelines for Prepandemic vaccines."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"if you are interested in a clinical exam and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician."</seg>
<seg id="1903">"if you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="1904">"it is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for inclusion, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked the antiviral drug the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1907">"the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice a day, which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Atroase depends on the body weight."</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases the HIV-amount in the blood while taking in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"however, AIDS cannot cure the damage of the immune system and therefore also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"the drug Agenerase inhibited with low dosed ritonavir was compared with 206 adults, previously used protease inhibitors, compared to other protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the modification of the viral load following the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"in the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenerase, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies per ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir."</seg>
<seg id="1915">"in children Agenerase also decreased the viral load, however, with the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1916">"in the study involving adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase inhibitors the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:"</seg>
<seg id="1917">"in the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to a stronger decrease in viral load after four weeks than in the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:"</seg>
<seg id="1918">"the most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amspravir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">"Agenerase may not be used in patients, the Wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or drugs that are just as degraded as Agroin and are detrimental in high concentrations in the blood."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"as with other medicines for HIV, patients who are taking Agenerase are the risk of a lipocrystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonecrose (dying of bone tissue) or an immune response syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the rejuvenating immune system)."</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors has not been proven."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"Agenerase was originally permitted under" exceptional circumstances, "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"in October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Glaxo Group Limited to approve Agenerase in the whole of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children over 4 years."</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules are administered to the pharmacokinetic boosting of amspravir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amspravir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than capsules; therefore Agenerase capsules and a solution for intake on a milligram per milligram are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice a day together with 100 mg rideonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the extra supplement of Ritonavir (Boostery), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily)."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg of body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">"pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asthma in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction on 300 mg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3)."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">"herbal preparations, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of amspravir while taking amprenavir (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic-active hepatitis demonstrate increased incidence of liver dysfunction under antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"the simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucoccortic oids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment outweighs systemic corticosteroid effects including morbus Cushing and suppressing the adrenal function (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of atriate with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of Myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"4 For some medicines which cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Standards Ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"in the case of patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective due to the reduced plasma gas of amspravir (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"if methadone is given amprenavir at the same time, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate symptoms, especially if there are also still low doses of Ritonavir."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylglycolocolocoction of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups."</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be canceled in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">"patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus."</seg>

<seg id="1957">"in the case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may result in severe clinical condition or deterioration of symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"although a multifactorial etiology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher Body Mass Index), cases of Osteonecrose have been reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART)."</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase should not simultaneously be given with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">"CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be given together with medicines, whose active substances are primarily used via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"it was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma gas levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed."</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum level of amprenavir can be reduced through the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>

<seg id="1970">"dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however it is recommended a close-meshed monitoring as the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known."</seg>
<seg id="1971">"there has been no pharmacokinetic study to use asteroid in combination with didanosine, but due to the antasizing component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues from Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below)."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"therefore, in combination with amspravir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is required."</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amspravir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggests that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">"if these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma gas."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"if these medicines are applied together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of amspravir and Ritonavir on delavirdin is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this purpose."</seg>
<seg id="1979">"pharmacokinetic studies with agrophy in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma torches of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration."</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole with 200 mg Ketoconazole at once daily led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazole compared to the value observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may result in interaction with Awarase."</seg>

<seg id="1983">"based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids can not be taken at the same time as Agenerase because it can come to resorption dysfunctions."</seg>
<seg id="1984">"simultaneous use of anticonvulsiva known as an enzyme inhibitor (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amspravir can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas from amspravir."</seg>

<seg id="1987">"in a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma bar increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%)."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"as a result, the simultaneous administration of asteroid with knight cavir together with these glucoccortic oids is not recommended, unless the possible benefit of treatment outweighs systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1989">"with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced enhancements of the plasma gas are expected to be administered at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"since plasma-level increases of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to Myopathy, including a habdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine with amspravir is not recommended."</seg>
<seg id="1991">"it is recommended to monitor the therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirror as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased while offering amspravir (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1992">"therefore, Agenerase should not be used along with orally taken Midazolam (see section 4.3) while being treated with parenteral Midazolam caution at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas from Midazolam to the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">"when methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for opidium symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"because of the low reliability of historic comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as the amprenavir dosage is adjusted when Amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"in simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, enhanced control of the INR (International normalised ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"the effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended."</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance tests based on phenotypic resistance tests clinically validated phenotypic interpretations may be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amspravir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that expel diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV that can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">"each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved."</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there are currently data for the cross-resistance between amspravir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistances, either alone or in combination with other mutations."</seg>
<seg id="2032">"on the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pretreated patients, in which a Fosamspringra- halfway scheme failed (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and Saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates), and Tquinavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates)."</seg>
<seg id="2033">Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"early cancelation of a delayed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which can be detrimental to subsequent treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2035">"evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI pre-treated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose ripples."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"one hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017."</seg>
<seg id="2037">Primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non-substandard threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">"evidence of the efficacy of unbleached Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged between 2 and 18 years, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"in the studies Agenerase was used to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"after 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase of the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value."</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data treatment optimisation should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children of the expected benefits of "unbundled" Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing the mean duration (Tmax) is up to the maximum serum concentration of amspravir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"508% increased, for CMAx, by contrast, by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily)."</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amspravir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">"therefore, minimal concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption."</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amspravir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, with the amount of unbound amspravir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"while the absolute concentration of unbound amspravir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosing intervals depends on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the steady state over the range from CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 should be given with caution when given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is made from a solution of 14% less bioavailable than the capsules; therefore Agenerase solution and Ageneric capsules are not interchangeable on a millimeter base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of a kidney function disorder may be minor on the elimination of amspravir and Ritonavir."</seg>
