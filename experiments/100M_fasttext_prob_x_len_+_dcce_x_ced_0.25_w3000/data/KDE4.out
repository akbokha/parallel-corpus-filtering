&quot; the module website can be translated in the &quot; &quot; &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; menu . select the source and target language of the translation from the list below . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the whole &amp; URL . &quot;
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish is in the best case produced a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore no important decisions should be made dependent on translations without checking the translation beforehand .
&quot; only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish @-@ Page itself , where you can insert translate texts directly . &quot;
&quot; the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available . &quot;
for more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select settings Exten@@ sions . open the map box tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; compile it before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available . &quot;
the module An@@ gle Filter ( also called folder filter ) is available in the menu bar under Extras tab . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s actual working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and thereby open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : documentary element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system .
tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , you can easily recognize large files , even then easily , as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ graph display representing a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colours and labelling options . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched to View Color Mode , can either show depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of a different file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle is to be used ( whereby hence display errors caused by restrictions on the sign of the pedal ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for Tre@@ em@@ aps Dar@@ ing Algorith@@ ms , the rule should be adher@@ ed to that the area is propor@@ tionally to the size of the entry . the purpose is not always maintained . it is drawn frame to display the ne@@ sting of entries , and this box needs space that is then lost to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is for the lab@@ eling and to avoid space losses by frame always advantageous to divide the areas so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns , or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view position on the area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher level to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small testing application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for use by c@@ ach@@ ograp@@ hen . &quot;
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Images per line has a slider and a script to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
to view the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image you specify whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are shown in the gallery among the thumb@@ nails .
&quot; with the check box file size of the image , you specify whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
view the image size check box to determine whether the image size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved . &quot;
&quot; using the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub @-@ folder to which level the sub @-@ folders will be included . &quot;
&quot; to copy original images , please define if the original images are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
using the check box comment file you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be set here :
&quot; the media playback for the navigation zone can be found in the &quot; &quot; &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; menu ; View menu under window navigation pane or use the F@@ 9 key symbol . &quot;
&quot; to play , click in the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in media playback . &quot;
&quot; change browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and OS detection for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . &quot;
changes the code in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse to access browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly by using this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the set browser ID is used for all pages of the website that you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry Con@@ figuration ... you can set the range of information on the browser used and the operating system in each individual .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ Albums . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( Manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , dozens of professional skills are available . it works completely in the 16 bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management - workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore you should report problems and possibilities for improvement .
&quot; whenever you are in the program , the Help menu provides an entry problems or desires .... This opens a dialog with a sub@@ set link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to give you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; and hopefully soon even answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; visit home page to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; the best start to get involved , is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to announce in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; for the first time you start , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file is stored . this path remains the same for all the image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also be used as an Al@@ ben@@ library . setting up digi@@ K@@ am collections . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the pictures , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; thir@@ dly recur@@ sively searches the libr@@ arian in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to include out @-@ of @-@ date &amp; digi@@ kam ; to insert a point before the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste take no photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it &apos;s possible to b@@ ypass it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw @-@ cameras in the Help of raw @-@ camera support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ Albums . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission .
&quot; digital cameras also support the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . as photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now outdated . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the Exif support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how simple his functionality can be expanded through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Interface Project ( Manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to make the modules available to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complement one function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in words , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio &quot;
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind also displays symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the settings dialog .
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album room . these albums can be sorted by the folders , in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ cy properties or after the date the album was created first , the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to give you information about this collection . to access the album features , you must right click on the album and edit the album tab in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . selecting the collection from the tool@@ bar can be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums By date sort by date .
&quot; the Buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date to calculate the oldest , the newest picture or that of the album &apos;s average . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; if you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the right mouse button and select the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be accumulated .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . of course , you can use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the image window displays the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be shown on this album in the image window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pes buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait for a short while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this allows you to avoid creating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can change settings digi@@ kam ; set up change . select the albums page and adjust the range of preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help window that appear . if you let the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor let a moment rest over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
&quot; photos are all what it is with &amp; digi@@ kam ; goes . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . you can reach all the functions that came with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the processing of the images . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... select . in the digi@@ kam section ; image editing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . to this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for turning . the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ de@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; used either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers , the individual photos or whole groups can be assigned . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word@@ list@@ lif@@ quot ; to work together , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either to &amp; quot ; My cat@@ ch@@ word quot ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then select new key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked a new key@@ word after you cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this will be the sub@@ stit@@ ching of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by right @-@ clicking and selecting the key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the right mouse button and set it in the context menu As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a key@@ word , you can drag them to the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My cat@@ ch@@ word quot ; drag and drop them there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail of the images and select the key@@ word from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can specify a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords given to it . in this way , you can assign a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event that it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have finished a photo with keywords , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the Key@@ words menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the time frame display shows a tim@@ eline adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . this displays all related images in the main window . &quot;
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database include names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ end er Search box is a small lamp the green is used when searching matches . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures are shown again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box like the one described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is performed . the results will be displayed in the list of My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after search , you just need to select the respective entry in My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you select Search , the form to enter the search box appears again with the previously entered search information . if you select as an extended search , the dialog box appears for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Tools for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the search button in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search will provide you with an enhanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . all rules are added by operators separated , en@@ um@@ er@@ ated . an option can be added to this list with search group / search string added or deleted from it . additionally , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . using a sw@@ ell@@ ist , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of un@@ used search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; finds the right pictures . also here can be set a threshold .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in or hold it and move it . move it while you move the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; provides a light@@ box in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; add L D@@ em light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and opened its window .
&quot; from the preview , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right side of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and make a zoo or im@@ position operations on one of the images , then you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited for sorting out of a series of pictures . if you are using combinations from the tool@@ bar , then the first images will automatically be loaded into the fields to compare it to the left . the picture on the right will be displayed in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal del@@ e@@ ders are also working directly from the lighting table like F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the spotlight . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you can see at the crossed arrows . in order to bend the visible area of the image , you must click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the Pre@@ view , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zoom function as well as in other views . just use the zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are pre@@ viewing in the Pre@@ view mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos pic@@ ks , sc@@ ans or saves digital photos carries out a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , protect , protect and use photos . we will review , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , ch@@ op , archive , optimize , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes up , inde@@ xed , seg@@ mented , sec@@ ures , searches , seg@@ mented , conf@@ is@@ cated and exports content that is a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is based on your definition of data that provides information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you do not need to store any picture . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you merge anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you must eventually switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant influ@@ x of images on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % have archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend saving metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently select the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ kam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; you can start with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos during further work . &quot;
&quot; let us now proceed with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import kat@@ alog@@ ized images from another source with embedded stit@@ ch@@ words , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . the changed keywords are being followed by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub @-@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the diagram shows how different metadata is over@@ l@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let most of anybody see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . thus the inscription has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him over the motif that you moved has to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it &apos;s the strength only having a lab@@ eling for itself .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes into the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already drives with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to exploit ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ ation are already countless and will be deep@@ ened in the future using images with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . this then shows the photos at the recording site . you can also export the images to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , i.e. also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information is in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s name . examples of this may be titles like : photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider panel to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group / agency that offers the image is given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for pile processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk failures , disk failures , current violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; rolling on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious issues must be dealt with and you can &apos;t take longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollars ; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . so the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also true for Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study &quot;
&quot; in short : dis@@ cos are longest running when operating in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In the case of lower temper@@ aments , the fault rate increases dramatically . some of the errors identified by S@@ MAR@@ T announce the im@@ min@@ ent failure . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not account much , this is different from devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage to your computer , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed Mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable resulting loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is normally available in the form of a connector bar . remember , however , that not every connector bar also contains a over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripher@@ als connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide surge protection , which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor variations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically make battery energy available when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system in order . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software are interesting . &quot;
&quot; this is only a small price difference if you think about how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go into holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . your free memory is limited to 1@@ GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned up thanks to the TCP protocol and are included in the large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the machine . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturb@@ ances will remain und@@ et@@ ected until you get a picture of one day . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors are un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not particularly affected by broadcasting problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors on a lower level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for job platforms . in case of not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage than e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been si@@ ghted for a long time .
&quot; open Source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more deterior@@ ated . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anyone else for loss of data . so , in every year , you can backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you do something dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , replacing disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ iev@@ es are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast Prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , there is a common reason for data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differentiation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer folders r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were really changed .
save important images right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another visual medium .
&quot; this approach allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you will get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : metadata , stored in the image file , stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , retain memory , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable paintings survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re@@ assess it while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to ask yourself how the current system is used backwards . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer default . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new disk was recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ F ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will become easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; PNG was used as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression . &quot;
TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open resource format developed by Adobe Systems . DNG was developed based on the needs of the camera formats . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata .
&quot; this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; -@@ technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive it in front of an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . however , X@@ MP &apos;s metadata is stored separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use DNG as containers and put it together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include work in architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your shell archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a complex process , you can use external programs . if you res@@ ume the images with &amp; digi@@ um , then you should add the metadata again . these may be trun@@ cated by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to get . in the Ad@@ ding of a Photos to an album , you will find a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings to import images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect these to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it . an additional description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image is not yet downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; the Metad@@ ata tab shows the internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all . this downloads the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired selection methods by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and download Sel@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new images are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to download the buttons All or use Sel@@ ected images , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folders . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; invite the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete Del@@ ete . if you want to delete only some , you must first select them and delete selected ones afterwards . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successful in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ Album , before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera file completely , you should do this about the camera &apos;s amen@@ ity , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the options Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the transfer opens three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing panel . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information about orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during the shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Metad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to disable automatic rotation , use the Extension button and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window . &quot;
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available &amp; digi@@ kam ; this is used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ kam means ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch off this option . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button Download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears , in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is done , it asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder selection dialog to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or simply wish to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how come the GPS data into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS @-@ Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be made with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude grade or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the den@@ oted coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these , by clicking on the icons of the left . &quot;
select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copy@@ ri@@ ghted data . these data are automatically written in the relevant IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera site . also in case of database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should include the professional description of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the car field , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to give the photo that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be available the image available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the relevant IP@@ TC fields . this means that the metadata is permanently in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . these metadata is also available to other programs and can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save image cap@@ tures as embedded inscri@@ ptions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cur@@ sor rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to show , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the light table from &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you then open the light table , these settings are enabled if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling , it means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since PNG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; you can comp@@ ress the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images using the TIFF file option . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if you select the los@@ s@@ less JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can save losses @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . as this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference draws a little bit soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is using a solid color balance , which was photograp@@ hed on a white card that was photograp@@ hed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your pictures are burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top lights , as they display the pointed @-@ in white in the settings . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still non @-@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the option to recon@@ struct the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix colored pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as though A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a color devi@@ ation correction , as you are carried out during the raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions on how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information how to translate color information from a color space to the other is to make the colors as accurate as possible .
questions when an image is opened in image editing / Start color management module with raw files .
&quot; check the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c in which you store all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the ability &amp; quot ; standard source ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color managed not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color ton@@ ing or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma isn &apos;t corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to do the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could be manually corrected , rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on Canon models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the destination : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Gallery Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . &quot;
commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on and off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera properties on the left side show a list of all supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Auto detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . below are serial , US@@ B- and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog box for moving images to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you need to save the changes with the knob changes .
&quot; you can also display the greeting screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in case of starting , this speeds up the starting process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; setting Bei@@ m Start for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the starting time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you see if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to adjust the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting entries / editing .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules see the image editing section .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most needed functions .
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using file Save or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
you should possibly create a copy of your image before changing it . this can be done with file Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the restore from the File menu or use the button &quot; Rec@@ over restore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . &quot; you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving . &quot;
nearly every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can undo you by selecting Edit Rec@@ over@@ s or Rest@@ ing by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to go back and call C@@ tr@@ l ; Shift Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the reverse or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed respectively restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , down image or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the check menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fication factor &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you want to use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can do this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . you can call this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; Main Window . see the section for setting up image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print some pictures or whole sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album export printer wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five tab is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC vent field in other applications you should observe these restrictions .
&quot; once you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the application button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
&quot; the rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ ding . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the assessment is written in the IP@@ TC field . the enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the key@@ word view displays a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree , and a selection box with the keywords previously used at this stage . &quot;
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in the search for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom of the picture is further relief when you enter keywords in a series of pictures . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are saved in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will be applied only to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , key@@ word and search views . if additional one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also draw and drop by keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it to the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the key@@ word filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off at Settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you usually have and created a rule and notice that it should be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control panel . &quot;
&quot; this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an Advanced search across all the elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner , and the colours that you print or publish on the web will be based on your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; when the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see more information below )
&quot; your only other educational editions are via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another colour space and have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e shaped region , and colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to only work in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is located on s@@ RGB , then you either need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . use it before attempting any further manual processing .
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , reconc@@ ile , automatic matching and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction attempt automatically out of your colors the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; this method adjust@@ s the brightness channel of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same number of pixels occurs . this is a very powerful operation , which causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete Hist@@ ogram area . &quot;
contrast wi@@ dening : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a re@@ ji@@ us@@ hing of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it through the menu entry Color White balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dim down . &quot;
&quot; using the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
save images and store exactly this . every setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ view button sets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original . if you save this your original image will be changed .
&quot; you can set the enco@@ ding depth per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding needs more disk space , computing time , and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF , and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter Color Management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously , allowing you to store multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you always need the same error and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for the correction of the tape , you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under Color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Far@@ ming effects provides you four colour effects , a solar power effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ an , was an effect that was created when exposed to a partially developed pressure of a short flash . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar synchron@@ ization . at about 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not produced on photo paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar panel effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ire &quot; &quot; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via provides very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via has a very saturated color but also some photographers whom the hardly landscapes light up too much .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and therefore it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can try to preview the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors .
if you can make a photo with poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous power / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is the tool for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controller and watch how the image changes .
&quot; on the right you can see the original and preview of the image . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium sounds , often called gam@@ em@@ arks . &quot;
&quot; the three color pi@@ p@@ ette can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of output values can e.g. be used to create a back@@ light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ just@@ ed for all shades , medium and sun shades . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image for Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below is an example of adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fi@@ cial channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , linear mode produces a broad beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve part to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and that the associated image pixel dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; when you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; when using this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons , automatically create the curve of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ous curve . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ aire channel . shadow and sun@@ shades were set using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
channel bl@@ ender of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change color shad@@ ings of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own tab .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to retain lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness , as the channel bl@@ ender then is the tool to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color becomes a visible space that comes from the colour space . the colour space consists of small rough art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the colour space first . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any bl@@ ender setting for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ancy option is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action ability . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold into the shad@@ ow@@ y tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a sep@@ ia . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sep@@ ia il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ kam ; App@@ ly tool texture allows you to apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . &quot;
&quot; relief : move this parameter to the right , increasing the appearance of the depth or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture . &quot;
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
adding a frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame the module can be started from image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter you place the desired frame type for your image . throughout , the picture complet@@ es with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ates it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target frame decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio previously . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into one image at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using the mouse . you will need to adjust the font size of the image size . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image is saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the digi@@ kam ; tool template apply you can place a template through a picture .
the menu Image St@@ en@@ cil App@@ ly in image processing can be used to place st@@ encils via a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add your template of the sten@@ cil , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to place your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set to the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the preview of templates . &quot;
below the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process must be summ@@ arized with minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a little bl@@ ur . the same phenomenon can be observed when col@@ oring points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more after@@ ward shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG images a camera is often used for internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers have a field of sharp@@ ness already during the image of the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo using the sharp@@ ness of the shar@@ pen@@ ing process . &quot;
&quot; in general , sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focusing you will find further information and a comparison of all the techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to make the picture a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tw@@ ise and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur is a very good tool to remove sli@@ ders from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thereby for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t from shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence fl@@ aws in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focuses a picture by improving sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted escape filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation .
&quot; the circle @-@ shaped folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ission is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good result . &quot;
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . the values are 0.5 and values near 1 ; &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very poor . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos; s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß @-@ sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed Gau@@ ß is . this is most commonly caused by a previously executed Un@@ shar@@ fe filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can create good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to make all cuts , color and intensity gra@@ dations on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; in general , bl@@ ur@@ ry masks produce better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ ring the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in theory , bl@@ ur@@ ry masks always have to create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ ear filter . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better for processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the field correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regulator smooth@@ es the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings for fine tuning , you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a steady smooth@@ ness over the picture . weigh@@ ed larger values mainly homogen@@ ous regions and details sharp . a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be subordin@@ ated afterwards . &quot;
&quot; direction dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es equally in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a movie gran@@ ulation or CCD noise , a high value can create wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness factor above all . then , the relative smooth@@ ness defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . normally there is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ step since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated step width &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the increase of quality you get by selecting this option is minimal . it doubles the term . we therefore recommend it to release it .
the buttons Save as and loading make exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; image errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round , that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed using this tool .
&quot; below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub@@ windows details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings . &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore adjusted smaller errors .
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to notice lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the brightness tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the ga@@ ol tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of dark@@ er areas , which are typically smo@@ cked more strongly . however , it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , can remove noise and phase j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the reduction of noise you have set can be saved into the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to make the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soften@@ ing with the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ating sof@@ tw@@ ise and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , movie gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ fit digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the texture of the text is performed with a different tool , the image error correction , the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm he produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ ts@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the buttons Save as and loading do exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and then loaded again . &quot;
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button . &quot;
below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . the original image is under ( 1 ) and corrected under ( 2 ) .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old colour photo that was read with a scanner . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel from photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels &amp; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the suitable dark image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will detect the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard notices the last dark image and re@@ charges it automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : an average of the neighboring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixel in the block . for a 1 dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; but it also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or less , as otherwise bl@@ ur effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the great exposure area of today &apos;s film and color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a cent@@ re@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a cent@@ red filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of signal strength at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 , un@@ locking . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ ette in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; l@@ enti@@ l dist@@ orted is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical l@@ enti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color@@ less distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , fl@@ atten@@ s but on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient fourth grade correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two can be almost eliminated any geometric distortion .
&quot; general : this value controls the magnitude of distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected , and positive values are cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the power of distortion fourth . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners &apos; has the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
&quot; bright : this value adjust@@ s brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box will preview the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the t@@ onn@@ ing- and cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as all first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ e- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the transforming crop out of image processing or via zoom controllers of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as shots of the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you hold the camera by hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters for movie gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows become white like snow !
&quot; because the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infr@@ a @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is placed under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the pointed lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ular@@ ity on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix great silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; in case you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined vision especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film direction effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better suited for large pictures . smooth controls the smooth@@ ness or , seen from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth@@ ness 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sket@@ ch . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . therefore , images whose gra@@ dients should change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . &quot;
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important to the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ily landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and look like it is seen through glass blocks .
&quot; wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is dist@@ orted here with a different version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using the sharp@@ est effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ ci@@ ble : bl@@ ur@@ ks the image along with star @-@ shaped lines that originate from one centre . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image by rotating the pixel by a center . this simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a rotating camera .
shar@@ pen@@ ing : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to appear back in the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ur@@ ks the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograp@@ hing , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos , or to add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sh@@ utter sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ ks the image by acci@@ dental displacement of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of an invol@@ un@@ tarily moving camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : finds the paint tank in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses a protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can keep using the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing to hold a range free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or turning in the right direction . &quot;
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information here or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is checked , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Download buttons are used exactly . each image magni@@ fication can be saved as text file , and can be loaded later . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo blowing by enlarged a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo , you simply need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drawing the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rect@@ angle , creating a new rect@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the records file Save or save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the rect@@ angle &apos;s size by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the To Cut aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in the portrait aspect , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; cutting to aspect ratio use a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , in@@ ch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the setup aid settings allow you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic sections are based on the principle of res@@ emb@@ lance . like the third @-@ rule re@@ ins , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal . &quot;
golden middle : the golden middle is a division of different natural growth patterns like the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the flower pet@@ als of a sunflower .
&quot; the gold division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden centre provides li@@ que@@ er assistance lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal . compared to the third @-@ rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition conduc@@ ts the gaze of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angle . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above . their ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that unlike harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place on these lines can be a static object more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and Ver@@ tical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the knob color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the help lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . &quot;
rotate your image with slider . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the Settings button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function transforming zu@@ cch@@ ini from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : indicates the width of the new image , including empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : indicates the height of the new image , including empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angles left above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to ber@@ some is to cut the picture with transforming zu@@ cch@@ ini from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; select your image by using the Horiz@@ ont@@ al angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two lay@@ ings generate twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming zu@@ cch@@ ini from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other par@@ c@@ els to read and write . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath . &quot;
&quot; this happens using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file extension is shown in the image processing . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; accepts . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to choose the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced , in order to save the image data to a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also be saved los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw format , you can read in English by Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . hereby , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short movies . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editor and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to display films or edit .

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contain . your description follows here .
&quot; all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft , noise suppression , re@@ focused , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king , etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the thumb@@ nail . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter . &quot;
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are marked .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : display a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in or hold it and move it . move it while you move the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallet or search the folders by files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box Bei@@ m cur@@ sor is activated under the button paint , the color is inserted from the color table at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ rides another ; depending on whether the check box has been selected over@@ write . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m Curs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; use the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color is followed . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ ophon edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left side .
&quot; graphs are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that are &amp; graphical ; are based on the program author &apos;s &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; dot ; graphs . the &amp; graphic ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphic ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well @-@ integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or graphs in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
&quot; more needed software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs . requires in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to view the dialog . &quot;
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and low without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer , the loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; instance , open &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; instance or display the graph in a sub@@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . once again , you can save your choice both saved and later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be adapted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without header and with another font
&quot; the Renew@@ al shop gives the option to specify the behavior when a file is modified on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or check the program each time . &quot;
opening the page Open is the ability to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time it is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
&quot; the context menu , which normally appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up other options : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose between different &amp; graphical ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
&quot; the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for non @-@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ ed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the k@@ not circle shaped according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms select special options , or also modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( set or ung@@ eri@@ zed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ eri@@ ed graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is checked , the overview will be shown if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse cur@@ sor . with this mouse cur@@ sor click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source folder of the source repository .

the K@@ IP@@ I module can read images and provide tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading images from a scanner supported by the S@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source of which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by changing the default values of duc@@ r@@ h to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated fil@@ es@@ ize will be displayed to you in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the scan button , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; to save the image . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the Import &gt; Screen Sa@@ ver from the menu . a window appears in which you can adjust the different screen fot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear to allow you to see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse is read . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot is to wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other working surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send his photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world that photos of your camera shop online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family around the world .
the Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time you will be guided by the process of generating a token , so it will be used for your authentication , so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful login , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented following a successful login . &quot;
&quot; just close the browser window and return to the program . after you click Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button Add images should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button , you can upload the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
&quot; with the options Ac@@ tu@@ ally , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can adjust the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are class@@ ed as a private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option to select the size of the photos in front of the upload , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool for export@@ ing your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and latitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ api.dll may download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above dialog appears then . to create a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same places at the same places as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed , which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have trace data from a location for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the options for inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog coordinates the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . select the region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Guide this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can be changed manually between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages compliant to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory .
&quot; the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated pictures . for this , select a folder that you have to write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module creates the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started to preview the gallery . click Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or slide . the viewer can be used for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed as default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions below to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is increasing , as no compression of color information takes place . for example , this can also be found in PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . &quot;
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; first , you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can create the module via extras MPEG slideshow . &quot;
&quot; the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there , you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition will be specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let them black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all the settings to your preferences , you can start drinking the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick par@@ c@@ els using the Settings button at the bottom . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; first , select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . using the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the key parameters such as G@@ amma , Bright@@ ness and Red / Blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches have no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your pictures often or later use the JPEG format , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata stored in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif data . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode when you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ ride existing file . this is helpful if it has been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate dimensions in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window will appear with the images selected by you . add more images via the button Add images . for the last selected image , you can preview a preview on the right . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and add them to the list of images to be sent .
remove images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached already as app@@ endi@@ x .
most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails to send . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and the mail is enclosed . &quot;
&quot; PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original extract data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL Transi@@ tions option enables very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option indicates that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually termin@@ ate it manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly choose the images shown in a random order . so it is not the order of pictures used in the album .
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your machine and the selected transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a different effect for each transition between images .
&quot; during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar , you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module imple@@ ments the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as a background for your K@@ DE work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; once you have received your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through these , see picture . how you can see through a comparison with the image are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of influence . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save their own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to locations , keywords , and other categories you have defined yourself . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images in addition to the names , select the button that is on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . &quot;
&quot; however , you need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image check window ( described in more detail ) and select the category Editor &apos;s entry in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you access the search in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . you can view this dialog at once . &quot;
&quot; when you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are scann@@ ed according to this text . if you wish , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date may be either a part of the total date , e.g. in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures on which Jes@@ per , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather like to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog select the demo , if you start a photo@@ album ; first start , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . then some sample images loaded and you can try out the functions of photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document for downloading . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed list preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be shown in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built @-@ in version , which you can create via the File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the review and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages , you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the overview page . for more information about the export files , please see . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which are visible to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can scan your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
&quot; first , you need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder is saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to choose either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check whether these are really visible for viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , properly works you will have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are just described are related to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name is set to the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have spent a lot of time spent on viewing the pictures , recording location , etc . , you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not even make this work even more . &quot;
with &amp; photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , Cre@@ ate . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have created when you create the HTML files , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by means of HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which can be accessed through the File Export menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; when option manually copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Autom@@ atically option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images are automatic for you . &quot;
&quot; k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be up to 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu item ... select , and photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select what images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alise the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called by your database . therefore , in the third dialogue window , you will be asked which categories of the import@@ ing file should be imported and which categories they match in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) Installation of the information about your images , via ( 2 ) search and view , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual will talk about pictures , but often this includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that allows you to back up with a program of your choice , e.g. , Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ album ; notes the folder in which your pictures are stored and automatically re@@ use them on future starts . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; through the menu entry settings on photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will find the different settings . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which you can call on the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the Options dialog you have already mentioned sub @-@ categories . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained in . &quot;
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&quot; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plug @-@ in interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the module . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , they are distributed separately . most modules however have a help page , which you can call over the module itself . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are used together by one another , it may be that the modules were tested with a photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules using the demo database before you access them to your own images : the photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications which use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : this is an album simply a folder . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
besides the current album &amp; photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums .
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you would like to use the category persons , we will do a photo@@ album ; so do if you have chosen persons to view this and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules are available with a photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start screen , as soon as you start a photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the possibility to display any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image can be viewed individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again whenever you type information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images inside the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown on all 50 pictures , you can find that the used names are moved up , the people find faster and associate . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments for each picture separately , you may still want to edit all the selected pictures and add these images with comments . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located below the picture on the top right . &quot;
&quot; if you have added several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you will see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that this is a group , a special icon will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the Comment dialog &apos;s context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new super@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a box by drag@@ ging it outside the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the window &apos;s appearance to your needs that you are happy with the settings , click on the Options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can om@@ it a box completely . if you want to get this window again displayed , use the options ... and click here to hide windows . see this in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images in case you don &apos;t have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the thumb@@ nail size by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will appear in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the preview screen . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit selection from the Edit selection menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&quot; photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images , without saving you on your hard disk . of course you have to record the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this feature requires you to copy files out of the folders and copy it back . &quot;
&quot; in the picture menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end of those you want to see for others , click Privacy . alternatively , you can also lock all the images that your little sister may see , control and lock the menu entry All apart from the current view . &quot;
&quot; with this , you have specified which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again displayed , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all the images on the hard drive and on the other , anyone can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to take a look at private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them some@@ time . for this reason , photo@@ album features a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . he naturally shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered via the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether all information is displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and after by using the keys image high and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can enter the image and zoom out . with the mouse button you can simply draw a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the minus button can zoom in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the same key plays the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and mini @-@ key .
&quot; with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you view images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the viewing and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and look at other images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look at one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your images , they are available in the browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add all of them once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you display categories in the thumb@@ nail view , then you can add characteristics to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to switch the painting from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; to work , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete control , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu item in the Insert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed , so that you can select the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ e@@ tion , either from the Edit menu or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input error and click App@@ ly and disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL @-@ user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; click Pre@@ view in the Properties view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub @-@ order item ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross local . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera controls . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position of moves . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a Vis@@ i@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the super@@ ordin@@ ate object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the chosen level of view selected in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another arrangement , you can adjust it as you like . you can also store multiple window arrangements and switch between different arrangements . &quot;
to anchor a window above or below a view draw the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , draw the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map fli@@ er at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter onto the desktop or click the small to the left pointing arrow in the cham@@ fer strip . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer strip . to prevent the closing click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location . &quot;
the current window view can be saved with View window ordering . it will display a dialog in which you can store the window ordering under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene . &quot;
&quot; a rendering mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar , or in the View menu View menu ... select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; each ring mode has a name . you can enter any name , but make sense a name that lets you recognise the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality , you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is re@@ group@@ ed and adap@@ tive because the rec@@ ur@@ sion@@ al depth depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the default threshold , then both pixels are charged by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , the pixels are divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and tested for further classification . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the creation of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter . if you switch off j@@ itter , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection comp@@ utes . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
&quot; on this map , you can specify if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ends , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene file , select the File import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialogue window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . place the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example high field data ) in paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
&quot; you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for moves , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the floor , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you turn off edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold values . detailed information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section window arrangements it is explained how to create and store window arrangements .
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
&quot; the list under the name displays all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button , and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; with a new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with map card you get a map card view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without a more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
if you have installed everything error @-@ free you will see at the first launch of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you will get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , see more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you press the App@@ ly or En@@ ter button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the view of the camera here . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a cube ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; indeed , provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a ground : &quot;
&quot; a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and press the App@@ ly or En@@ ter button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the view of the wire is now showing the level , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite ending . if you ren@@ ounce the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the object &apos;s view . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise one unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub@@ object . the pig@@ ment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment shows only a matt black material because you can check the pig@@ ment settings at any time . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see color on a cube or a ball in preview , click App@@ ly and then you can preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is set right now . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should obtain the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the Color List you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the Color List you need to edit two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose color @-@ coloured each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
this step should be easy to execute since you should have already understood the basic way of working from &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy as creating the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to push the button or the push button ) so that the ball would float above the floor , as you have shifted the base around one unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now gives a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; first select sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; however , you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities for you and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer is shooting hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that render the scenes render ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered will need some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
&quot; in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved version are disc@@ ar@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ one command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
saves the current window ordering and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to change commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to pre@@ tend rough surfaces without having to model every b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geometric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by applying an image file as color chart . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ fter show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images to display . &quot;
pictures can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or pressing Return .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all pictures should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialogue setting - &amp; ball show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ fter show . in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the short@@ cuts for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; in the end the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can show &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show , so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can display the program as well . &quot;
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determine whether the slideshow will start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ball show here ; in the flash@@ cards brief commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ screen@@ ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ screen@@ ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de , is &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; an open source project . this means that the user accounts for at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to display your message . &quot;
&quot; it is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ .php , then we want to encourage you to answer any other user &apos;s list of users . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ sample ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ stop@@ p ; . &quot;
the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left .
&quot; in the range of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . the colors with what you should display should be in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . the same side@@ bar is also shown in the image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab : &quot;
&quot; &amp; nomin@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images , which does not make more than images to scan and save . &quot;
&quot; &amp; nomin@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images , which does not make more than images to scan and save . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by typ@@ ing the information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set in the command line of &amp; nomin@@ l@@ ite ; with the command channel @-@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the user can select the scanner to be used , and press OK to open the scanner . cancel and stop . &quot;
the other settings contain more det@@ a@@ illed options of the driver . &amp; nomin@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the complete preview into the window . &quot;
if the image was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving , then the image is stored and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a break and you will return to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the Settings button , the same @-@ name dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type such as &amp; nomin@@ l@@ ite ; to save images . dialog to save for each image opens the dialogue in front of each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; nomin@@ l@@ ite ; to save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must choose to ask for a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored at option saving without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... Change . &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the knob help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; nomin@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over k@@ icks off the K@@ DE over -@@ dialogue for &amp; nomin@@ l@@ ite ; . the knob settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; channels .

&quot; the global keyboard short@@ cut lets you set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , and set glob@@ als short@@ cuts by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , and select short commands . &quot;
you may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Short@@ cuts . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options , but Amar@@ ok also has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow running external programs and commands . in this way , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure &apos;s configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or unit length ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Title are also passed , so that the script can be used to remove the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ custom@@ Ready menu ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to e.g. saving data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally be identified with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the cap@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i Scrip@@ ts Page by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . you might even search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
&quot; as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure script with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any trouble about the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; to view Player window , the player window will also disable or disable the player window . if the option is off , only the Play@@ list window will be displayed . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; creating voices : this feature is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thus , the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot;
disc@@ ard the mood files at the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is checked . mood files are stored at the location folder of the appropriate music files .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to start when a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use relative paths to the music files based on the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep track of the current piece visible when changing the piece , the play@@ lists window will pop up / down to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing to context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise grey shown section . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection among them for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; re@@ play at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece with which it has been stopped at the last one . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch off the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the font you want for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the ability to customize the O@@ SD colors for script and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog to color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not enabled , the default values are used . &quot;
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card chart audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this map .
the collection card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set how to deal with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the inter@@ viewed and their sub@@ folders are searched by music .
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Combin@@ ation Field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected another device is required in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will the host enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to input the data needed to connect to the database .
the flash@@ .@@ f@@ m card draws support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send play@@ lists and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
calling like performers : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters will be called to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed then ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small instructions on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as O@@ SD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .@@ or@@ g. Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file exec@@ uting in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
most of the time it is because Tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
&quot; make sure all the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate the autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &apos; $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : m@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; and Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects will be ignored . &quot;
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so adjust that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first . &quot;
there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are most easily clari@@ fied by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or by developers . use the forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please insert only one error , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the File Browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to intui@@ tively keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to set the evaluation for a piece . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select from playlist from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist and let them fall exactly as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the add button , the Play@@ list button is saved . click on it . &quot;
&quot; you probably miss the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel program . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; you may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder are supplied in the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to deliver a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously transmit audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem situation and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another sink ( eg . oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you just would like to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , deco@@ ding it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the sound buffer size ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set : &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playing . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia complete to get the faster arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ pi@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less j@@ ig@@ saw react the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all the components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask for IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running before you go to bed , then you will wake up from the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP address and your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA .
&quot; visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows can be separated . click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button clicks a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pushing the input key after searching in the playlist the first search result will be played and the search is reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and the console appears many error messages . what now ? &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ ok MySQL support .
&quot; insert the CD , then click on audio CD in the menu . a file browser opens with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot;

&quot; this is basically the previous evaluation with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more the piece was played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can edit the evaluation for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select rating or change F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the dialog Metad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan , which is not connected to the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok . &quot;
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . des@@ elect the option icon when playing animated in the general settings .

Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
&quot; now I have re@@ installed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How do I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a hint of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module also needs to be installed . &quot;
you will get the error there is no element present to act the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
among settings Amar@@ ok set up ... audio output specify the device . typically for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card support m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not being taken care of . of course you are allowed to take this problem by yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for the Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there are the set @-@ up wiz@@ ard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag the items from the collection browser to the playlist . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can instantly browse the remaining entries . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can save it using the Play@@ list button . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ lists . if the playlist is in the folders of your collection and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist you will get different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio @-@ CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD plays in WAV format . drag the WAV files to the playlist and then press the Play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the Burn -@@ menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed , which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center . at the top of the window , you will find a running text showing the current piece or the current stream . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the field . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also activated . the PL button or activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to set the play position or volume . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own preference settings . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many functions that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the full@@ ness of functions deter them , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; in the navigation zone you can find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist itself is easy to use and yet powerful enough for advanced users . &quot;
&quot; context Browser shows different information about the current piece . its look can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpretation . these three sub @-@ windows will later become more detailed in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use , you may notice that the sub @-@ window will fall away . the information presented there are now distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title you will find the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; in order to display cover images in context browser , the cover images in the same folder will be supported . the file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser also displays cover images , which are either downloaded by the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five most high @-@ rated pieces of the current performer .
you can adjust which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current performer that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on any of the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or an album to the playlist .
&quot; as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start . &quot;
&quot; the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database , and no running text script is required . &quot;
the Search button opens a search for google.com based on the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpre@@ ts - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First of all , the pieces are arranged according to the artist and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Performer / year - Album - S@@ ort by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by one another . the interpreter is ignored .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are sorted by genre , among them sorted by performer . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
directly under the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection field with which you can filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different time frames , starting from the last 24 hours to one year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options . &quot;
load - This adds up the current playlist and adds the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order .
attach to play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will get the same effect .
stop pieces in queu@@ es - This function adds the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
&quot; save as a playlist ... Save the selected pieces as a playlist , and you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved . &quot;
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details see the Media Player Browser section .
&quot; all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn to CD - D@@ ue the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be shown . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark a compilation - Mark@@ s the selected album as a compilation , and it appears under different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
assem@@ bling @-@ mark - Change a compilation of selected album back into a normal album . afterwards the album will be displayed no more under different interpre@@ ters but again under the accompanying performer .
&quot; the play@@ lists browser is simple to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent playlist players are possible . click Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intel@@ ligent playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub @-@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to use , it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer tracks to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list of performers . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar , there is a search section with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser you &apos;ll find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . for example , you can access tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachments of files can be tri@@ cky by simple drop @-@ down . in this case , holding down the Shift key may be helpful : this will be added automatically at the end of the list , not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired position . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed , which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button as long as the text field is empty . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by whit@@ esp@@ ace separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search by entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one of two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , which contain one or two or three ( or combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing blan@@ ks , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched by entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a particular search term , make a minus sign in front of the key@@ word : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or contain a higher rating than 50 and not include the comment bath .
&quot; you can set the sequence sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order to the entries . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you can add the Add button that allows you to add pieces to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow feedback and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refres@@ h rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu like what you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many other available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback trol@@ leys and volume control . you can set up the buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist . through this menu you can access the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plugins . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left .
&quot; with the View menu , you can select what is to be displayed in the Cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queu@@ es administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece into the queue , the playlist will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the play in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( details to set up these later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to work with this dynamic playlist .
&quot; in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist , so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the list of recipients will be added at least one piece of your collection , so your playlist will be filled until the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . in the same menu entry , dynamic mode can be disabled again . &quot;
&quot; the new button ref@@ uses the current playlist , adding new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the settings . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . this opens the dialog to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for coming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear any piece in that playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces are removed from the setting of play@@ able pieces . &quot;
pieces played - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played play . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the Settings on the right hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts make your own settings . you can customize the settings by launching the script and then clicking on setting .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts by clicking on a script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script anymore , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plugins are used to activate the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , just activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed , then remember that you will receive a poor quality when re @-@ coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process . &quot;

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open source patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio coding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is used in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
&quot; l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module . &quot;
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog saving will be displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for every single project file Save .
&quot; if a project is changed and not saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between stores and changes . furthermore , you can inter@@ rupt the shut@@ down and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ saved project that is to happen , as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any non @-@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called File Cl@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you want the files directly from the top view to the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Br@@ ennen , which causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains dates . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
&quot; open the CD @-@ Copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy from a CD that you want to burn later on . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also choose cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; open the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD which you can burn later on . also , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &quot;
&quot; the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously selected DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , enco@@ ding settings , and even ways to modify the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . when an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not check@@ ered , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is checked , its contents will be shown in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , lock and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the Content View allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head bar is a narrow@@ er area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks nice and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b , setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators need privileges , so you need to enter the password for the administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at startup . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine tune the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by a shell script , for example . &quot;
&quot; to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , so your taste and nature of your tasks are critical to which of the accompanying programs you give preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the d@@ co@@ p command line utility . in order to be able to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you must first make sure &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de have in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features like copy@@ CD , format@@ dv@@ d and other features for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively one can get a project through the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( these Ko@@ di@@ ver packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; . this program is not intended to deal with any copy protection . if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device det@@ ects the protection , it is not possible to use a protected audio CD ; simply avoid buying copied audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , all manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step , for example , you will find more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB will start on request of the CD @-@ data according to the set @-@ up of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case must first connect to the internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der has been configured in the enco@@ ding tab in the Setup Code - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the standard . it is important to note that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the enco@@ der settings tab in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for enco@@ ding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ages ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like Enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats , the information obtained by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions &quot;
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :

&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the enco@@ der program to create the folder and file names and the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with enco@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the key words ( English : tag ) when enco@@ ding MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button of the wiz@@ ard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is important to note that here is only spoken by Text : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : this is the author ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b you can use another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than those used in the system . in this way of configuration , it seems that the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; whoever wants to know it more accurately , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see also note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the released WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first open are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package needs to be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ dec . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set those areas that let the program make exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 phrase words ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine because it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write bre@@ aches on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , something that is probably only done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used to comp@@ ress music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any time of reading a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device descriptions for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the tab card General settings . here you don &apos;t have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information on generating key@@ word words ( Tags ) is missing . &quot;
the map CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; download data automatically over the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; . this is slightly associated with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is more than 620 MB big , consider this twice if it is worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this path , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will function as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equally as regards the server , as many fire@@ walls support the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . to disable the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore just try himself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; throw out after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD , at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder , in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; everything will enter as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the creation of tags to Version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of WAV files enco@@ ding simultaneously : in a dual core or Quad@@ core , or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; termin@@ ated . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk exp@@ ires . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , has been described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; as we have a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successful fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually input data instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD now needs to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a brief moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen shot . this only if the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this is not done then search in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers after the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; returns a window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of CD @-@ data and title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input line &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist does not have to be typ@@ ed in the field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; warning : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag @-@ information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help section for more information .
&quot; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap , for example , can be found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the play list .
&quot; note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or click the All Pi@@ eces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection to read the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what happens . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a co@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been enco@@ ded successfully are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , reading and coding is parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration settings found to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; most distri@@ butions contain a pre@@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . if you read this , you probably already did it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at individuals that compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot sustain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . &quot;
&quot; strange , if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke game of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time recording of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the procedure used .
&quot; session support . when you quit &amp; k@@ de ; end playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop the windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces it is added to a collection and then played on one another . )
&quot; once you play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the knob . &quot;
&quot; when you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and thus change the speed . in order to get back the original tempo , double click on Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry break in the piece , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in a piece of music on two types . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can specify which events to be presented , and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song so you don &apos;t need to set up anything manually . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , select from the Settings menu the entries text events or song events . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can sum up . in this section , you will find how you can efficiently use collections . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize ... Click here and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set each one in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection using opening or drag &amp; drop . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu descending order of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be set . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump on a song , select the next song button next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the previous piece , the previous piece from the menu item , or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events are translated into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and lets you always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all the sound cards GM -@@ KO@@ MP@@ AT@@ IB@@ LE are ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file , which stores all necessary replac@@ ements for playing a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
&quot; Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE Key@@ map &quot; &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE Key@@ map &quot; &quot; One more key@@ map &quot; ... &quot; EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D &quot;
see that DE@@ F@@ INE is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
&quot; please send me your map file as an email , so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible . &quot;
in this section it is stated how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on tone with number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , similar to a rif@@ le shot . this includes the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant with the term &quot; &quot; drum @-@ patch &quot; &quot; of the patch , where every sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ism instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the ever @-@ same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument .
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . look for example the included key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , simply make it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name name is used for this channel . of course , if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in that case , patch x will always be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio pitch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ blowing event with the value of 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ ta@@ ve higher . in order to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pian@@ os ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played just .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results in two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file takes about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file takes 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; previously , activate the Autom@@ atically add setting to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
&quot; I have a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , only switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file only once , without adding it to a collection , turn the Autom@@ atically Add to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; let us assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so adjust the setting Autom@@ atically add to the collection and open A.@@ F. . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me , further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Ant@@ oni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; they really make me joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact with me as I have the file already . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and I don &apos;t know anyone for it . I want to emphas@@ ise that I am only going to program further because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , Mr. Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Di@@ ef@@ enb@@ ru@@ ch , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Peter Gr@@ itsch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . &quot;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to playback DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu Book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category &quot; &quot; Perman@@ ent Play@@ list &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the added entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ player ; do not run through an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you need to select the playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing the playlist .
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Players , some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation for starting and editing can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ le option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; DATA@@ Player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the startup animation does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of your favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ forman@@ t sr@@ c = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; ; supported .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Players ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Players . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
&quot; there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Players ; everything must be configured by typ@@ ing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a flash is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; KM@@ player ; it can even embed the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the alignment dialogue file Zu@@ agen@@ das of K@@ DE must be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ player ; is to start in a console and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . the art@@ ed process is called pop @-@ player . if there are no errors here , the Back@@ end issue is inside &amp; KM@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should reproduce all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; if you can watch TV , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , you need to be configured to use the device and the TV channels . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ player , the dialog in the settings is to be used under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be recognized by which one is selected . the enco@@ ding to use must be found ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Players can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presum@@ ably this kind of playing of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) &quot;
&quot; internally , from KM@@ player for sources different names are used . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
is there any hint how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine only starts slowly but why does my CPU have to be tested for their performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is outdated . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically takes the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile ; needs .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be res@@ orted to the package &amp; tex@@ te ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included in the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact can be made via the K@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile , or if you wish to add extensions , please refer to the K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , easy to use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to operate , also a lay@@ man ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; use mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; here just a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ file @-@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick entry Wiz@@ ard of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : hereby the type of document to be issued is selected : article ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
coding : this is set to set the character enco@@ ding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . in best case UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for the correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is only a short description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; K@@ ile , this function automatically creates a blank line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the men@@ ue settings ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files , the back search may be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ ent @-@ dependent file ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; K@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing and converting DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices .
&quot; when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are coupled with the editor and once an element is cli@@ cked into the DVI ; file is the exact opposite of it . as soon as we click on a section in the lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding point in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . using a master document it simpli@@ fies working with other .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project settings .
quick @-@ install : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors are available in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is read on the in@@ ode , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after rapid construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for rapid integration of common elements into the document . the first choice field is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the drop @-@ down box is available for ordering items such as keywords , foot notes or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( choice for a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand .
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . it can be set the font inscri@@ ptions for the main text , the joints , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document may be written by reason at hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be sp@@ read@@ ed in the text . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu build or the button fast . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; for storage automatically .
&quot; if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for error logging . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few places should have another font size . &quot;
the changes are only checked within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many options to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . it can be added , for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold , cur@@ sive , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either using the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is invalid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be displayed in ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with the lat@@ ex ; -@@ mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wiz@@ ard was typ@@ ed a bit of text , some adjustments should be performed for the better read@@ ability of the document . to this end , a quotation , a couple of points in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem should be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( Eng@@ l . d e V ice I n@@ dependen@@ cy ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability by some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) by file printing ( if the printer is correctly set ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the search function allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this just need to set Modern under Settings K@@ ile ... Tools build .
&quot; to set out the search term , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source code and cli@@ cked on pre @-@ select search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer takes place then . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; is marked with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document of &amp; K@@ ile ; open and corresponding to the corresponding line .
&quot; should an error occur when using fast @-@ building the &amp; DVI , an error may be available . if an error is present , this will be shown in the logging file or in the message box . &quot;
&quot; the logging file er@@ ects the source code in the source code . in the editor , the buttons can then be used Previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error for spr@@ int between errors . to view the faul@@ ty line , you must click on the error in logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting an empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard will be used to quickly create a new document . &quot;
&quot; frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file will be opened or a new file will be created . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... Cre@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( such as name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in the K@@ ile ... Settings General . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps have to be completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template can then be selected instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and executed through the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and lifting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be done in the menu directly out &amp; K@@ ile ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to experience his possibilities , the manual of Kate should be used . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start working directly with the reading of the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called by La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a useful description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be used as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way clicking on \ \ par \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p is just \ \ par .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to search the different kinds of source codes and to mention them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many wiz@@ ards may add additional br@@ ush@@ marks . these are a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . the men@@ Ã ¤ ge edit marks , or the corresponding button root , make the jump to the next or last spr@@ ing@@ time stamp . this is also highlighted in the first input of a character . &quot;
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; K@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent options have been added to &amp; K@@ ile ; features always include many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; K@@ ile ; special commands for their selection .
&quot; a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) refers to tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands and all other lines of the source code . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back @-@ shr@@ inking ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to point out a part of the document , of course , this can be selected first and by pressing the button Del . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key root C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing the paragraph .
&quot; it has already been emphasized that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for more commands under Edit environment for a more efficient simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the cl@@ asp of the environment .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when you enter many ne@@ sted environment commands , you can quickly lose sight of the desired environment . this command finally encryp@@ ts the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group , some important commands that correspond to those of the Edit environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the s@@ wollen cl@@ asp . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the cur@@ sed cl@@ asp of a &amp; tex ; group # , will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many sh@@ allow@@ ly s@@ wollen groups par@@ enth@@ eses , the view can quickly be lost . this command finally encryp@@ ts the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions are used as guest houses . for the purpose implemented it is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; used for two simple reference marks . also for the end of the acquisition , the sign &quot; &quot; is used . &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; knows this case and for two complete initi@@ ation marks for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic set of double quotes may set up in the K@@ ile settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .

&quot; when activ@@ ating Shift ; En@@ ter En@@ ter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; K@@ ile ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
within a table environment close &amp; K@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent new@@ line break .
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to associate the columns in tables environment and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; K@@ ile ; tries to encourage this . while pushing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; seeks &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab in the underlying line .
&quot; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code completion provides , this was added in &amp; K@@ ile ; to include specific commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . these are designed for automatic execution . all these modes can set up for different working modes under the K@@ ile .... &quot;
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to gr@@ ind the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , you can use &amp; K@@ ile ; also spr@@ ing@@ marks can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing the mark box , and the desired parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; fully able settings can be made to these lists . it can be selected various boards for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands , as well as doors for general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for the execution of environments . there is always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered , and the default setting will have a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for accompl@@ ishing the surroundings . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full @-@ time environment or the Alt + Shift key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically filed and it will appear \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and termin@@ ated by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; K@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is included . &quot;
under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the default mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; supports custom lists of cryp@@ to@@ currencies that can be replaced immediately with longer string strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be executed fully . as an example of a check list , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the men@@ ue editing or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Emp@@ ty key , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large windows are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many devices in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; K@@ ile ; the complete agreement for all the already written owner . &quot;
this mode can be set up in the Settings menu ... K@@ ile can be disabled fully . here you can also set the threshold for the display of the full version .
the exec@@ utable files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / the Persian home folder .
&quot; the graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics about the graphics formats , the sections should be noted . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is en@@ quired , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus to compile , create converting and create view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used to use Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by means of Alt ; 4 , and using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the fast @-@ building command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;

first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the users . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ te ; are supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference . &quot;
&quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) , but rather is a complete user manual for the lat@@ ex ; it is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ te ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ te ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that contains a database with all the &amp; K@@ ile ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are group@@ ed into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for parcel names or keywords . by &amp; K@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expected to be inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the shared work@@ folder , then let the current working folder go . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for that . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported error and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be tested is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then , the current file will simply be attached . if not , delete the file with current file and select the file to be checked using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed verification selection . &quot;
&quot; to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; that is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility of the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if not , remove the selection of the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result shall have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone is using the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plugins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start editing the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog enables you to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to locate the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves as a unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and pressing the ba@@ iting button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and notes . see for more information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage through the collection of members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific occurs in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project so that later , how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that will insert a file into CV@@ S , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; page Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog enables events to be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the address data selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note : it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word can be entered in a comment area followed by note text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where nickname of the set nickname of the team member is , role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leaders Area Manager Sub@@ project Manager should be given the respective area or sub @-@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case , but whit@@ esp@@ ace characters and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... This dialog stretches over a few pages that are dealt with one another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including auto @-@ completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
&quot; large / Lo@@ wer@@ case of Tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted Tags . normal case / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / Lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal case / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : when attached , for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this is immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; do not include optional tags automatically : as above for any other tags , except for simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and end tag automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic response of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the standard button can restore the default specifications .
standard character enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created or otherwise than open @-@ opened files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will be out@@ stretched from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . however , this setting here is displayed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash during the next startup of the program , the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the default window settings back at the next start is useful if the user interface has changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
warning messages -@@ area serves to control the possibility of switching al@@ erts by means of no more ques@@ tioning .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source @-@ view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of par@@ ser node in the document , can be set into details . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area to specify abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded in editing to more extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ tab abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; the plugins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be given to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; load component in &quot; &quot; Only Read Only &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied loading . only @-@ read @-@ parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the entered information is correct . select if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as the support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations via plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection field the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; UI : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower do@@ cks . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower do@@ cks .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action is made by connecting to the de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which needs a de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue view .
&quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ bit request has started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a script is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible error @-@ adjusted in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; in@@ stru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next , as if there were not the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog you can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to suit your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to help get better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for market and scrip@@ ting languages , as well as CSS ; to enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s consist of two file types , the Tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag files contain two file types , descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic Lei@@ sts of picture buttons ( above the editing window ) , which could include text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . &quot;
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the contents of the properties dialog ; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows . the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without risk of a writing error .
&quot; tag files are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
&quot; yes , the day has an ordinary attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only ) &quot;
put a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
&quot; it defines the name and type of the attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute should be shown &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ name % , this means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that group together the elements of a list . it can only occur once a attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the location of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( i.e. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently the check is only done when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following one example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D Edi@@ te DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = Release 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nickname .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current key symbol can be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the default input . in the selection box , you can specify what is to be sent to the default input . options are : &quot;
selected text : the selected section of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages sent to the default output , by setting the value of the output field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the marker . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , in case the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable dialogue &quot; Edit day &quot; when available so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it , before we have difficulty . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the menu ; , Graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; use default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; in view that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , stiff , refined ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol will be inserted ; start@@ led ; -@@ tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions specify ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and select the desired action . in addition to the text box there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog on settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to preview the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; conf@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by testing all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; back in the correct folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot;
perhaps the most desirable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ figuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # items in the main index Top item = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 6.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see the documentation for example : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction ... ... Basic syntax = Basic syntax ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently displayed at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resource files will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the field of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used for the context of context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is reported directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c , namely to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you are certain that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the exp@@ ended resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners , or anyone else . at various points , you can send an e @-@ mail menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can fill one . in the New Resource dialog you need to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start up@@ loading with clicking OK . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and sig@@ nat@@ ory . in case of problems it warns and it can then be cancelled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , creating can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files in the tag@@ XML format may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can start from the DT@@ D loading and converting an DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . then the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name into the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tional line : the string that is in the Doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
&quot; fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand this and to get full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter attempts to bring these concepts to them , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from tool@@ bars via promotions , everything that is known as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which means the joint use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building views , the flash@@ ers with information and the tool@@ bars . please propose and for more information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all boxes , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tags in the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file if the string under the mouse cur@@ sor refers to a file . &quot;
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click on the symbol representing the tag . now , you can fill in the data for this just entered tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields . &quot;
&quot; building man@@ sions ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and strip it . in the presentation with file widths , for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right @-@ click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be performed using the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website , etc ; There are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is available in . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; with this view , you can display the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ h of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application @-@ oriented entry system allows you to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are shown .
&quot; this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts , which are executed , display all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol , and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the option of defining own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar by email .
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to adjust the files to your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up languages editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above requirement , it must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; col@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ing is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased dramatically . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can be increased almost every task .

&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or run k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick @-@ access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there special characters included to &amp; HTML ; description , so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; switches off the block selection , which allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key . &quot;
goes directly to a line number . this is very useful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages exist !
search for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
training and turn @-@ on of the problem repor@@ ter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the column column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows , for example , to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details . &quot;
loading a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... saved . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from your hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; anyone who made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
loading / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without rest@@ art@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present fail the store .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
&quot; activ@@ ating or de@@ activ@@ ating the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plugins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu items . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax root mode for the current file . the list of available ho@@ ax parameters depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes time may need time or cause unpleasant graphics . recommended is the map mode mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated by selecting an entry . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
&quot; changes in this dialog will affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - Web@@ browsers . &quot;
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which can add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate assistance according to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed freely , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be best filled up from top to bottom , since e.g. after completing the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed . all these paths and author information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when you enter your name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without blan@@ ks with the extension web@@ pr@@ y ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ y ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you handle local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default , templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows adding files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let it be hoo@@ ked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are included . if a project is started anew , not an@@ gled . &quot;
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the hook , clips from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the lower window profile or with the Shift key ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in detail . additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; supplementary option to top , also files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can read more about project views . &quot;
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button . in this case the troubleshooting is described .
&quot; in the window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by inser@@ ting one &apos;s own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration window , event actions can be switched on and these actions add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment . &quot;
to open another project select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you will find changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project man@@ view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders beha@@ ves as well , however , the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu on the right mouse button : &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . &quot;
&quot; if only more one profile is present , the button will be da@@ zz@@ led to prevent removing . &quot;
&quot; the password will be retained in the core memory and will be forgotten when it comes to programs . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather uns@@ afe password on the disk -@@ option does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many extr@@ usions are created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft this is either a time saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply num@@ bing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project Tool@@ bar project or the Project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way to learn about the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the section adding tool@@ bars .
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , can ren@@ ame tool@@ bar tags or set tool@@ bars , where can be specified which actions on these or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will additionally remove the action and edit action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set up setting actions .. set .
&quot; templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful , if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates for whole websites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure to you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template Save As a local template ... &quot;
&quot; as soon as this is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File &quot; &quot; Save As template &quot; &quot; as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and laying on the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : you can only copy the file into one template folder . you can use all file management functions for it , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and create Site template , enter a name for the template and secure . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ set head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or link dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things while using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led once el@@ der@@ able attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set so , it would appear explicitly in this path unless they were explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and enables copying of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show the right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second partition divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are visible in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor on a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ bias of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit this , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that at the same time the changes both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cur@@ sor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is activated , this mode is activated by pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is set via settings Qu@@ anta ... After choosing V@@ PL ; view you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation : a small chip for fast computers and a large chip for slow .
&quot; if you want to change the title of the website , you will be able to choose documentation properties . this allows editing of invisible tags to work with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog will also be called once a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows you to modify the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . clicking on the list allows the change of content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the Content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button , selecting the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the cur@@ sor is used like in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using back button or remo@@ val@@ key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the tool@@ bars as in the source text editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , each other surrounding anchor tag needs to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the table wiz@@ ard or the lists wiz@@ ard are down@@ lighted . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool to study style sheets . unlike other styles of style , search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be trac@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile it , except &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;
&quot; a new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compati@@ bilities mode , orph@@ aned support points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded sty@@ list file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is for example loading a style file file . / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l is possible the following input :
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a template named my@@ QNA@@ ME or a given model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any my@@ riad that contains the string template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; my@@ riad &quot; is expanded according to the rules specified in the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop point must be termin@@ ated for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically carried out when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of further useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful , if two persons independently work on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result to be expected . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge full folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and re@@ jects the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check codes , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make typ@@ ing work easier by completely eliminating the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; sub @-@ Forums : ts@@ un@@ ami ( s ) ( Users View@@ ing this Forum : 1 ) 3,@@ 8@@ 64 6@@ 19 Happy Bir@@ th@@ day New@@ by ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; opening dialog enables manual typ@@ ing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is introduced . if for A a file is selected , for B and C one folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when inter@@ linking is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set up a output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . &quot;
&quot; note : at the moment , you cannot pull out anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the Info line is located . the Info line of the source pane contains the character A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . ) &quot;
&quot; the three spring windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , you can see which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that is good to see in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the abstr@@ action column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . when the line break is checked , the line is scored in broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the file name and &#91; change &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next solved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must be solved at the same time also a conflict of the manual . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be displayed and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and on the left a black bar appears . &quot;
&quot; the text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; composition conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignore the options or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side on , side down , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the start of each group ( as explained in the section together and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l picture Up / C@@ tr@@ l picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , conflicts must be distinguished between solved and resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l Inser@@ ted ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically copied to the clip@@ board and manually copy the manual copy . be careful with this option , as you might acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use the return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the len@@ i@@ ent of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically places an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator symbol is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press the input or return , the return of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , every option is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying manually into the clip@@ board is then dropped . &quot;
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step is not ignored . also while mer@@ ging white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a cart drive &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually , tags are made visible , but as white characters may be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; inten@@ sely searching for even smaller differences , the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and run mer@@ ging . check for details under documentation to compare and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ original . if there is already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig@@ ine , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must quit &amp; restart and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is set globally via the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
the selection fields for enco@@ ding will be a short note of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you . )
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . however , sometimes you just want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal or a second over@@ see column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just select the less important window . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together . the current file merge in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et names for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
&quot; when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first be given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff @-@ results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line @-@ down to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to automatically add @-@ generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for new@@ line adjustments . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor are retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ away pre @-@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes the text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively and merge . &quot;
... makes for each object a proposal to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and displays the simulated changes without really doing it
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merge individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folder is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start the mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry , or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be notified of a small message about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files will be listed , which have been compared to that time . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list of lists with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and every folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold up a folder by clicking on the + / - , or by double clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories can be folded and All sub @-@ directories can be un@@ folding with which you can un@@ fold all folders . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the plug @-@ in action cannot be selected automatically . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; for identical applications , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folder also have the same color . at folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for output file only B ; directly after the merge copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) is checked , then investigate &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; while mer@@ ging a file is processed after the other . you status column shows Fer@@ tig if the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if the file @-@ like method is chosen full @-@ time analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merged actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the merge operation . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then the three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as the target and the two @-@ folder merge B is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the target folder , also displayed in the folder structure . &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key symbol ) . to only merge the current item : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if there are still invalid merged actions by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types , a message indicating the defective elements appears . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all the entries , a dialog box will appear with options to run , simul@@ ate and break . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( mer@@ ging a single file ) , a merge @-@ window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , you can start / continue folders and press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; resol@@ ves on a fault , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not be merged . even if the merge operation has been over@@ done or not saved , these entries are considered to be completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; C@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called Directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that fit the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . you can enter several patterns . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than one pattern entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be more than one pattern entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ m@@ atically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 is not checked for possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders across a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; similar to the familiar to the ch@@ angel@@ ist date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results from mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe as it is assumed that the other file is not also modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ orig@@ ine extension , this will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders . &quot;
&quot; normally the folder merge view remains visible for the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be set to the folder and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders for opening which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blan@@ ks &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . hence , the authori@@ z@@ ations or the date of change vary from the original . ( note the option Trust of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
the main purpose is currently being seen as differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 then press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3 part from the context menu .
&quot; normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assume that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , the name of the original files has to exist . then , the patch starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are Comp@@ are ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GPL softwares for a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or get it like that .
&quot; in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is : but this is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict easily by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
&quot; so far , the effort has been too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot;
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c won ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . for this , please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ r@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install and install on a system , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it . &quot;
Cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) copies to clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift past@@ ing ) add the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current marking .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Ref@@ res@@ h function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are shown that show differences . this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior is probably modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for selecting the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other desktop areas . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual working areas are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field to the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is shown together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ al numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each working area is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ tops are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here is selected the view of the program window . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; appear in a 2x@@ n grid , as from p@@ ager @-@ applications in some other Windows managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right mouse button within &amp; p@@ ager ; and subsequent select switch set up ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.@@ g &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or apply to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ments . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; may be . &quot;
&amp; may ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; if you like ; start , a window appears as pic@@ tured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fying window is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , the area around the mouse cur@@ sor is like a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you may want to show a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( choice window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor settings . please note that this is not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays stable and only the lower right corner is to be moved . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
&quot; or stops the actu@@ alization of the ad . stopping the update will cause the necessary CPU time to go against 0 . &quot;
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected range will be shown in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically re@@ charge your set short commands for storing files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ bie ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and reduction &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; used to enlarge a screen area , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the l@@ printed in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for various people of benefit : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired . &quot;

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and those of each mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick , as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who are at the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and those of every mou@@ sec@@ lick can em@@ ulate pain . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; p@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the use of your computer . suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clearer : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; over@@ sees your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click once you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the intelligent move is enabled , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drag@@ ging at pressed mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
this residence time must be st@@ owed after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
&quot; if Intel@@ ligent delay is enabled , the shooting field ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wait before it leaves the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to sh@@ orten the reaction time , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider &apos;s General . there is a slider sound buffer you can adjust to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; Start &amp; k@@ de ; Start . this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set by opening the dialog . if you pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the preferences . in particular , the intelligent slide should be switched off first . if you get used to automatic mouse click , you can later move the intelligent move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first you should be aware of which places a mou@@ sec@@ lick is left without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window , which does not constitute a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse cur@@ sor , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scratch the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when an im@@ position has just started . if you use the intelligent slide in this case , this means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you will do a mouse click yourself . by doing this , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and use the cur@@ sor to another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . but don &apos;t park your mouse on a neutral area of the working area , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent slide , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent moving is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to use this way to copy it into the clip@@ board , or to use any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent slide when you just start using &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use . instead , use a mouse click at the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . by doing this , each time &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the intelligent move starts the shifting time . later , you can use the intelligent slide without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window , which should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome , and those who are pressing the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a particular time waiting for a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and laying with the mouse can also be done . &quot;

&quot; &amp; mouth ; is a program , with the dum@@ b user to speak their computer for themselves . &quot;
with the program &amp; mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of phrases that are to be talked about again .
&quot; on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen@@ shot ) , type the command , which will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup di@@ alogs . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text password . you can often choose text passages using text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you define the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the language chosen to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the words lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly spell words can be added to the word completion . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a delay memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth ; right set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select phrases that are to be talked about again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two map cards , voice output and settings , page word completion and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the box map , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the character enco@@ ding , with the text passed to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text remains unchanged as default input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications are a standardized interface for voice output , and the choice of this option is useful even if the K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first select box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Instant talk , the chosen passage is directly spoken and added to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection field closing of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text@@ book must be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . &quot;
the word word page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; mouth ; a selection field if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
&quot; with buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation . in addition , you can compare the word list using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can bring together the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays is split . in the upper part the text passages are shown as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text pass@@ codes or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar via the editing window . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and drag@@ ging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar for text pass@@ codes is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the right @-@ hand side and drag@@ ging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another position . &quot;
&quot; you probably have not typ@@ ed the command for voice output correctly or not fully entered . open Settings on mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the tab card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java ; it is currently only supported by English language .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ etz . the voice output is then possible with one of the following three command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice @-@ over@@ s @-@ dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ over@@ s .
&quot; since setting the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ s@@ d as voice service in &amp; mouth ; setting . &quot;
&quot; to setup use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people unable to speak , can run text by calcul@@ ating the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can re@@ generate again and again . &quot;
&quot; note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; not including speech synthes@@ izer . on your computer , you have to install a speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of modules of existing service , which allows each application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice @-@ over@@ s ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers who can be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . also the user offers interesting options .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; node applications .
&quot; the speech output is performed via the speech speech disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows creation of language editions on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Help program .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . you can also subscribe to the list by https : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility .
&quot; before you can use , you need to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust properly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the ticket tab is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the map card will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use it , because the speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to multiple expectations for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the flash@@ card leader in kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr , the ticket tab is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not pres@@ upp@@ ose a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to push the speaker in the list on a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list determines also their priority . &quot;
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
&quot; choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the board card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the Card General and check if Language Output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map card orders to create and manage text orders .
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start &amp; k@@ de the language output system . click on the General tab card to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map card orders will be displayed and you can read text orders and let it read . see . remove the marker , the TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system of &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start , cancel , pause , and res@@ ume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be shown if the K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map box in General and activate the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; running . then select the text that is to be read , and select Tools text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ Pre@@ amps and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; running . then select the text that is to be read , and select the text to read in the main menu . then the speech output should begin . &quot;
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; the Noti@@ fy is the news system by &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about events defined by you . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Account , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message in which your nickname is found in an IR@@ C channel . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the settings menu of this program . the possible settings for the Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as assumed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; filters are edited text before being sent to the speech disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace spoken words or short@@ cuts , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent specific defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the speech &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; screen @-@ Re@@ aders have the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of screen readers is read , the queu@@ ed jobs are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you read &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every job you encounter from the map card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the issue of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre @-@ reading , this issue is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; strings replaced parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions , which allow the creation of chat @-@ em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ formers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files to translate by &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set up a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter determines that its rules are not true , the text continues to be passed to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a notice ; -@@ Noti@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the side down . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; if a filter does not cross , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are shown below . &quot;
&quot; if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . upper and lower case is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just has to differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 displays , you may only type copies . &quot;
&quot; if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. The words must therefore be limited both sides by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it in di@@ alogs adding or edit them as help to assemble these expressions . &quot;
&quot; XML ; -@@ trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conversion . however , it can only be installed on well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reached above the environment variable PAT@@ H , it is also sufficient for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the board card speaker , or to a speaker with specific properties . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter passes , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that pres@@ ets the program that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the properties of the speakers established on the board menu . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can access it with a click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialogue selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or to delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all the conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the Language Output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output file via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ d via the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , type &quot;
&quot; open two &amp; console windows . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so SA@@ B@@ LE works at all . you have to do that even if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and about the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ing wil@@ ts output . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure the option character enco@@ ding is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replace filter . see . &quot;

&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ bau@@ d with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can find the source code from k@@ de@@ accessibility at ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

KT@@ TS works with every speech synthes@@ izer which can be launched in a &amp; console on the command line .
&quot; the list of languages listed above can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
the speech disp@@ at@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers .
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ accessibility , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , check first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of the speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is possible , and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into individual phrases . the user can go back to sentence or devi@@ ate , repeat , pause or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application sends text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the features of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it is automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the Add @-@ on tab , and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the tab card reader device will be shown . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter a festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text that is passed to festival . in the case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is made automatically . generally , it is considered that Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider you set the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display this grey , the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of the K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first movement is synthes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory consumption ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as the K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus you have the ability to read or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here are all the jobs listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just processed set . the Spe@@ aker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card board speaker . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can prec@@ - or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other map cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text entries are listed and managed here . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled and kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module comp@@ iling or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ 0.1 ; % about double normal speaking rate . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this map card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language assignments : &quot;
&quot; screen @-@ Re@@ aders have the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the screen @-@ reader is read , the queu@@ ed jobs are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . when you read &amp; eg ; just take a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special promotions for messages , warnings and screen re@@ a@@ vers when they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read the Noti@@ fy messages , launch kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; read no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications when a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nickname . &quot;
all events for which nothing else is stated in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected a user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker , who is shown as the top entry in the list on the ticket tab . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels of events . if a particular application is specified for a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the default al@@ erts as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button load to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voice , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech synthesis ? &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and stat@@ ute recognis@@ able filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , you can start reading or stop or stop orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the stat@@ ute features filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a stat@@ ute filter filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add another set limit filter filter , but beginners will get out of it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting . switch off the speaker selection and select text to read . simply switch the speaker selection , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the map card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal stat@@ ute filter filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything to this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
stat@@ ute recognis@@ able filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ates and insert a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator@@ es are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default stat@@ ute recognis@@ able filter preser@@ ves the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ ish ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen recor@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set limit filter filter , you can paste it again by rel@@ o@@ ading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the box menu option , you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the map card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the upper@@ most on the ticket tab speaker ) . in other words : no speaking abilities are specified .
&quot; use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from who is most likely to conform to the originally pres@@ et properties . &quot;
select the method to input the desired microphone characteristics by clicking on one of the buttons .
&quot; here , select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not matter , do not enter anything . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box , if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here . &quot;
&quot; as the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may possibly want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the area speaker who is most likely to delete the following , click on the Selection button to use standard speaker and then use speaker that is most likely to be followed . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 means the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , input is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get back tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; has been termin@@ ated . you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved by this , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I hold a text order , freeze &amp; t@@ ts ; one . on the console ; appears a message saying : unable to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , preventing the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , see the AL@@ SA @-@ project ( d@@ mix ) website at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have invited an extra voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it at festival , but kt@@ s@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ int / voices , add the new voice . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive now offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ text . ( that &apos;s because the HTML is turned into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML change @-@ in filter , and set up the speaking speed . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the websites with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ B@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . with that festival no errors produced , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects to S@@ aber &apos;s GEN@@ DER tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a custom string filter filter , and now I can go to &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the tab of orders is displayed , the order is only of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . instead , use a filter for setting boundaries detection instead . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling the command register register before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you can not simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; freeze in addition if you have a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de doesn &apos;t support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of speaking speed , but otherwise it is not necessary . Debian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a normal user , log in as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 is the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
&quot; the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . the configure option for switching off the output shows the configure parameter , which causes the passing of the output . &quot;
&quot; if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . &quot;
&quot; on Debian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs translated from the sources . &quot;
make su make install CD k@@ de@@ Stere@@ echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; In@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use the synthes@@ izer , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions when passing on . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up Russian voices , you need to enter a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 bit ) enco@@ ding like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , locate the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the enco@@ ding option must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option enco@@ ding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then the festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates speech from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival produces this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this process , additional wr@@ apper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folders , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found here &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA festival ; it is required either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) .
instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 you will not need to re@@ compile a festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .
&quot; ( voice @-@ location &quot; &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems , you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with the I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
&quot; this method uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; to issue and install first festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA , and make sure that both work . then you invite Festival @-@ Czech &quot;
un@@ zip the program to a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file must be in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ched speech synthes@@ izer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with still adequate voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can either adjust pitch , volume or voice speed with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . find Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer working with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; speech synthesis is good , but support is currently limited to a few languages . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ page and un@@ zip them to / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
on the map setting device selection select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correct .
&quot; epic is a free , open@@ source speech synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slov@@ ak@@ ian language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with still adequate vocal quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and epic T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the EP@@ s programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the tab speaker . enter in a &amp; console ; ep@@ os -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , open@@ source speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; command line can be controlled . &quot;
&quot; best use a command , which writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers must already be working properly installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , the device at all displays and setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed to install &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the module network settings will be loaded when the option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index option . when starting the module , this tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release status is best . by marking the setting of non @-@ recur@@ ring requests , the definition can be met permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in system administration mode , you can enter system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the Ri@@ der Network Interface serves to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the set @-@ up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button . set up in the device setup .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further options . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atically , TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the field of the network mask , the sub @-@ net@@ mask must be determined . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . by ping in the &amp; console , you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . switching on a switched @-@ off network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface .... &quot;
defines the computer &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary , because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS delivers this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 68@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the computer for nam@@ ing the nam@@ esp@@ ace is a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be displayed the New Nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog . &quot;
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution you select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It is displayed the dialog editing .
&quot; the name known by name indicates the host name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list of name known hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press button add several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog ready to edit is displayed .
&quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will refres@@ h the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console . &quot;
the website of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packs ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and to install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and Q@@ t ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely distributed . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be used . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point that has a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically when DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if there is another content to be found in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file will be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; the first was to create a surface for tar which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; educ@@ ates the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . do not recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ ten@@ se on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ ten@@ se , searches for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything goes smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes , in order to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched through the strip of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before casting the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt
&quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; tape @-@ types must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires form@@ atted before using the tape , this must happen before you are form@@ atted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ ppy disk drives normally do not require a format@@ ting of the tape drive , DAT drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the tape name and the capacity , the tape continues . all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the View menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including data rate and time remaining . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the check process has been started , the dialog settings dialog appears . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the Rest@@ ore menu ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery will appear . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings for recovery , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be new to recre@@ ate the tape index file using the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ build the index on two types from the tape :
&quot; as a result , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings is created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working folder , where the backup should take place . the list of files to be saved is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files located in it are stored on the same fil@@ esystem as the folder . folders that are on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; quot ; before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection on the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , it will automatically trigger the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically disc@@ ar@@ ded the tape . do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the option turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the band @-@ ID . the format of this string is the machine name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds gone by the tape in which the tape was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and analysed using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start tries &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol - to open . it will not be shown to you , and it opens itself instead of a small message box , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most probably do not have permission to read under Linux in the directory / var / log , for which normal user normally does not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or entered strings . the list of the protocol lines is now automatically changed , so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter . in default , a log line will only be shown if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be compared with the entries in the corresponding selected column . for example , in the log file system log , select the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of the level indication . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off in alignment dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only a certain process ( for example , in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines added . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go here further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this directory is named r@@ c.@@ d , etc . , and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not contain such things as set@@ serial , which only once started . such calls are named after r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have something confused , then you come to fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter the l -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level running only htt@@ p@@ d , sen@@ d@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or another time device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry in the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only happen if you pull out an entry in the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . in order to only copy them to a new run@@ level , you need to explicitly Copy the Edit menu or select from the context menu and add to the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cutting to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to open the Properties dialog . use the tab button to change between different fields . enter the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are retri@@ eved from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise it will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the pres@@ ets are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; at the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single , enter the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using Del@@ ix ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present that are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment by &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry saving in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two map cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some map cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only when you activate space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created where you can make individual settings . more card cards appear if Shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
the card pass administration will appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
this map box only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space restriction ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the fil@@ esystem field with space restriction .
&quot; the map group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Di@@ alogue properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , add , remove , and change the boot password , change the time to the boot of the standard operating system , remove , remove , change , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
