<seg id="12">"to use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and thereby open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentary element, all other nodes are subelements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with & FSView, the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. therefore, you can easily recognize large files, even then easily, as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView; is an entry in the Tregraph display representing a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colours and labelling options."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched to View Color Mode, can either show depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of a different file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangle is to be used (whereby hence display errors caused by restrictions on the sign of the pedal). furthermore, you can set the relative position of lettering in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for Treemaps Daring Algorithms, the rule should be adhered to that the area is proportionally to the size of the entry. the purpose is not always maintained. it is drawn frame to display the nesting of entries, and this box needs space that is then lost to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is for the labeling and to avoid space losses by frame always advantageous to divide the areas so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns, or recursive division."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view position on the area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher level to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore you should report problems and possibilities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">"whenever you are in the program, the Help menu provides an entry problems or desires.... This opens a dialog with a subset link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report."</seg>
<seg id="61">"& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, we would like to give you questions to other users of & digikam; and hopefully soon even answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful."</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam; visit home page to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">"the best start to get involved, is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to announce in the developer mailing list from & digikam;."</seg>
<seg id="64">"for the first time you start, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data file is stored. this path remains the same for all the image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">"later, you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will also be used as an Albenlibrary. setting up digiKam collections."</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the pictures, as base folder. & digikam; considers every subfolder as an album. no image is changed."</seg>
<seg id="68">"& digikam; thirdly recursively searches the librarian in its full depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders, unless it is iste in hidden folder. this allows you to include out-of-date & digikam; to insert a point before the name of the subfolder."</seg>
<seg id="69">"if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste take no photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digikam; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it's possible to bypass it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw-cameras in the Help of raw-camera support."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided to help you connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; -Albums. more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each media and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission.</seg>
<seg id="75">"digital cameras also support the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. as photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how simple his functionality can be expanded through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Interface Project (Manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to make the modules available to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digikam; by writing a small module to complement one function when the changes in & digitisation; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albenbauma, above the horizontal divider line or another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in words, data list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter works on the filename only if this ind also displays symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album room. these albums can be sorted by the folders, in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the Albency properties or after the date the album was created first, the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from an album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying."</seg>

<seg id="95">"& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. of course, you can use both methods to organize your photos."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window displays the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be shown on this album in the image window. each photo is shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupes buttons in the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="97">"when you open an album for the first time, you have to wait for a short while while the thumbnails are generated. this allows you to avoid creating all thumbnails in the Tools menu."</seg>

<seg id="241">"this is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; -technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive it in front of an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. however, XMP's metadata is stored separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as containers and put it together."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, reconcile, automatic matching and contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic correction attempt automatically out of your colors the best. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the brightness channel of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same number of pixels occurs. this is a very powerful operation, which causes miracles in a picture or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete Histogram area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast widening: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a rejiushing of all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it through the menu entry Color White balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top, a histogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dim down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"using the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then anywhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Save images and store exactly this. every setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preview button sets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original. if you save this your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the encoding depth per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding needs more disk space, computing time, and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously, allowing you to store multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you always need the same error and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the correction of the tape, you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under Color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digikam; tool Farming effects provides you four colour effects, a solar power effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatian, was an effect that was created when exposed to a partially developed pressure of a short flash. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar synchronization. at about 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not produced on photo paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel effect. the original image is the (1) and processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called" "Velviaquire" "effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia provides very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia has a very saturated color but also some photographers whom the hardly landscapes light up too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and therefore it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can try to preview the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem: a too large saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation can reduce the saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous power / contrast / gamma, the tool is the tool for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slide for the purpose described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked in and can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controller and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right you can see the original and preview of the image. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium sounds, often called gamemarks."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pipette can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of output values can e.g. be used to create a backlight image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. in addition, the Gimp Levels format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you are using this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shades, medium and sun shades. select the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image for Rot-, Green, Blue and Luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below is an example of adjusting the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2)."</seg>

<seg id="434">"in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images captured with a digital camera, linear mode produces a broad beam. in this case logarithmic mode helps."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a curve part to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixel darker."</seg>

<seg id="446">"sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color becomes a visible space that comes from the colour space. the colour space consists of small rough artefacts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour space first."</seg>

<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">"type: with this parameter you place the desired frame type for your image. throughout, the picture completes with a colored line, Niepce encapsulates it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a cute three-dimensional frame."</seg>

<seg id="470">The menu Image Stencil Apply in image processing can be used to place stencils via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">"for the template there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the stencil. if you want to add your template of the stencil, just send an e-mail in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org"</seg>

<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates particularly in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">The algorithm was taken from Gimp and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process must be summarized with minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blur. the same phenomenon can be observed when coloring points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more afterward sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images a camera is often used for internal sharpening. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners have a field of sharpness already during the image of the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpness of the sharpening process."</seg>
<seg id="487">"in general, sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image refocus the tool. under refocusing you will find further information and a comparison of all the techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to make the picture a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to soften softwise and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blur is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. you should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired image that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thereby for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt from sharpening and hence flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocuses a picture by improving sharpness. it used the copyrighted escape filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the circle-shaped folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß's Fission is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good result."</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. the values are 0.5 and values near 1; & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can take values of 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very poor. a usable value is 0.03."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß 's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß-sharpness. use this parameter when your unsharpened Gauß is. this is most commonly caused by a previously executed Unsharfe filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value equal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can create good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 'sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to make all cuts, color and intensity gradations on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"in general, blurry masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurring the blurred masking a larger neighbourhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, blurry masks always have to create artifacts. even under optimal conditions, it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the unsharpening mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better for processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the field correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the unsharpening of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings for fine tuning, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail-keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a steady smoothness over the picture. weighed larger values mainly homogenous regions and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening should be subordinated afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes equally in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a movie granulation or CCD noise, a high value can create wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness factor above all. then, the relative smoothness defines the relative smoothness. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. normally there is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-step since [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated step width [0.1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the increase of quality you get by selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the term. we therefore recommend it to release it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and loading make exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"image errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artefact in the foreground, that caused by a bad film storage during the journey."</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the subwindows details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore adjusted smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to notice luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubricate occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the brightness tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gaol tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of darker areas, which are typically smocked more strongly. however, it also pollutes the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjustment of the phase damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, can remove noise and phase jitter at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the reduction of noise you have set can be saved into the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">"sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to make the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool for softening with the menu item Corrigating softwise and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; Photo Restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, movie granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or retrofit digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the texture of the text is performed with a different tool, the image error correction, the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm he produces some compression & quot; Artefaktsquot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>
<seg id="549">"the buttons Save as and loading do exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file, and then loaded again."</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. the original image is under (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">"below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old colour photo that was read with a scanner. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="553">"the & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel from photos taken with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp."</seg>
<seg id="554">"bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels."</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels & quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the preview preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">"if you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects."</seg>
<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should download the suitable dark image to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark image will detect the bad pixel. note that the wizard notices the last dark image and recharges it automatically in the next session."</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">"average: an average of the neighboring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixel in the block. for a 1 dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">"square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block."</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">"below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2)."</seg>
<seg id="566">"the & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, cannot illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an opening of f / 16 or less, as otherwise blur effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the great exposure area of today's film and color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centrefilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a centred filter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of signal strength at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2, unlocking."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want a finer re-adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the menu color gradation."</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignette correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignette in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lentil distorted is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lentils on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colorless distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, flattens but on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grade corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two can be almost eliminated any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">"general: this value controls the magnitude of distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected, and positive values are cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the power of distortion fourth. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'corners' has the inverted sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">"bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box will preview the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the tonning- and cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as all first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would obviously be the wrong."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tonne- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the transforming crop out of image processing or via zoom controllers of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motives, such as shots of the front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees. keep in mind that when you hold the camera by hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">"the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO."</seg>
<seg id="591">"in the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image."</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for movie granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granulation and dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows become white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">"because the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infra-red film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is placed under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the pointed lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digikam; Filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granularity on your images. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix great silver grains of the photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"in case you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grained vision especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"the controller can calibrate the ISO-sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film direction effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"there are two controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large pictures. smooth controls the smoothness or, seen from the other side, the hingness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smoothness 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the & digikam; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. therefore, images whose gradients should change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">"the & digikam; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn."</seg>
<seg id="607">"filter Gravur is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important to the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondarily landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>

<seg id="612">"wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks."</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using the sharpest effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Incible: blurks the image along with star-shaped lines that originate from one centre. this simulates the unsharpening of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: wipes the image by rotating the pixel by a center. this simulates the unsharpening of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Sharpening: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to appear back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"motion blurring: blurks the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"soft sharpness: blurred the image softly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos, or to add a warm and subtle light."</seg>
<seg id="620">Shutter sharpness: blurks the image by accidental displacement of the pixels and thus simulates the unsharpening of an involuntarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpening: finds the paint tank in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image. this gives it natural your images a wet look. it uses a protected by Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can keep using the & digikam; image processing to hold a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentrop Filters. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it through mirrors or turning in the right direction."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information here or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is checked, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the Save As and Download buttons are used exactly. each image magnification can be saved as text file, and can be loaded later."</seg>
<seg id="638">"photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo blowing by enlarged a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">"editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo, you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drawing the rectangle. you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging on the corners of the rectangle, creating a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the records file Save or save file in the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the rectangle's size by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the To Cut aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in the portrait aspect, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"cutting to aspect ratio use a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"at the bottom of the dialog, you can set the max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"if you use the cutting tool for the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The setup aid settings allow you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic sections are based on the principle of resemblance. like the third-rule reins, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similarly harmonic triangles on the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division of different natural growth patterns like the spirals of a Nautilus pussy or the flower petals of a sunflower.</seg>
<seg id="652">"the gold division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liqueer assistance lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal. compared to the third-rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition conducts the gaze of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangle. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not a triangular triangles. diagonal to place on these lines can be a static object more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal mirror and Vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the knob color you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the help lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with slider. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Settings button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function transforming zucchini from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">"to change perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change perspective:"</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: indicates the width of the new image, including empty areas created through the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: indicates the height of the new image, including empty areas created through the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Angles left above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to bersome is to cut the picture with transforming zucchini from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram."</seg>
<seg id="679">"select your image by using the Horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shear, the picture is wiped a bit. for a single shear this effect is mostly negligible, but two layings generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after shearing, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming zucchini from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other parcels to read and write. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam."</seg>
<seg id="684">"because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF underneath."</seg>
<seg id="685">"this happens using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam; the file extension is shown in the image processing. you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam; accepts. in the Configuration section you will find more information."</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to choose the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">"image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced, in order to save the image data to a more efficient way."</seg>

<seg id="1044">"if you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; the second method is adaptive-recursive; the second method is regrouped and adaptive because the recursional depth depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixels exceeds the default threshold, then both pixels are charged by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predefined threshold, the pixels are divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and tested for further classification. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the creation of noise for the ray process called jitter. if you switch off jitter, change & Povray; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1078">"but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:"</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of programs for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the key words (English: tag) when encoding MP3s with lame, the switch -tt by lame and the title parameters of & kaudioCreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button of the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database, where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is important to note that here is only spoken by Text: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator: this is the author) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; whoever wants to know it more accurately, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see also note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the released WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first open are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package needs to be installed by the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined codec. more information about Kodierer is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real, and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to put on tone with number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), similar to a rifle shot. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant with the term" "drum-patch" "of the patch, where every sound represents another percussionism instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc.) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the ever-same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussions channel. look for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the keymap with the name name is used for this channel. of course, if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in that case, patch x will always be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-blowing event with the value of 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. in order to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="2029">"this is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document) can be started."</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: sh / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way try & quantaplus; the script in its path: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">"the parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file."</seg>
<seg id="2035">"in addition to the methods listed above, a script can input from & quantaplus; to the default input. in the selection box, you can specify what is to be sent to the default input. options are:"</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>

<seg id="2038">"if there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags in logical groups. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the marker."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings."</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"complete everything and, in case the tag has attributes and you plan to use it, enable dialogue" Edit day "when available so that an input when using the action is possible."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it, before we have difficulty."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"to create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the menu;, Graphics other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution)."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"use default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size."</seg>

<seg id="2049">"select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; -functions to the toolbar, or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview. open the toolbar to set dialog on settings toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"for example, I want a quick way to preview the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might believe that the & confqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"the new toolbar must be tested by testing all symbols, to ensure that everything works."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"back in the correct folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be stored in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder."</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most desirable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # items in the main index Top item = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag3 = tag6.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see the documentation for example:"</seg>

<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the expended resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or anyone else. at various points, you can send an e-mail menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, send tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading you are asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can fill one. in the New Resource dialog you need to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and start uploading with clicking OK."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installation, investigate & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signatory. in case of problems it warns and it can then be cancelled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML-languages currently not by & quantaplus; it is supported to work by creating a DTEP package. however, creating can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files in the tagXML format may be necessary."</seg>

<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which means the joint use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project."</seg>

<seg id="2197">"templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces."</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">"documents can be written by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"this type of templates is useful, if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree."</seg>
<seg id="2202">"as the name says, these templates for whole websites serve as templates. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;."</seg>

<seg id="2205">"select text in your document and click File" "Save As template" "as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with dragging and laying on the tree view templates."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"the creation of binary templates is simple: you can only copy the file into one template folder. you can use all file management functions for it, such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree from Konqueror."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and create Site template, enter a name for the template and secure. by default it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template."</seg>
<seg id="2208">"project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can pre-set headlines and footer lines or link dynamically with & PHP; create, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things while using templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the sub-window templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"to specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:"</seg>
<seg id="2211">"a selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled once elderable attributes are inherited."</seg>
<seg id="2212">"this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set so, it would appear explicitly in this path unless they were explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text building block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder."</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and enables copying of content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">"in addition, you have a context menu (show the right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from one place to another."</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second partition divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; -editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; -editor on a document containing & PHP, a small green symbol shows the Vohandbias of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit this, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"the second mode works exactly like the first one, except that at the same time the changes both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is activated, this mode is activated by pressing the active cursor from one window to another, whereby the position in the document is maintained."</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is set via settings Quanta... After choosing VPL; view you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle the recommendation: a small chip for fast computers and a large chip for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"if you want to change the title of the website, you will be able to choose documentation properties. this allows editing of invisible tags to work with the VPL; the document properties dialog will also be called once a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this allows you to modify the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2221">"meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. clicking on the list allows the change of content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the Content column."</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>

<seg id="2225">"inserting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbars as in the source text editor. it is to note that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed, e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text, each other surrounding anchor tag needs to be removed."</seg>

<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of further useful functions were added.</seg>

<seg id="2287">"also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful, if two persons independently work on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result to be expected. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly."</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge full folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and rejects the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check codes, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more annoyance if someone changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"when a file is equal and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make typing work easier by completely eliminating the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>

<seg id="2300">"what thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively large effort."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: at the moment, you cannot pull out anything from & diff3; pull out. only the drop of text in a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window, the Info line is located. the Info line of the source pane contains the character A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window.

<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff-results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line-down to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for newline adjustments. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor are retained for displaying and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line algorythm sees.</seg>

<seg id="2511">"first you should be aware of which places a mouseclick is left without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window, which does not constitute a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again."</seg>
<seg id="2512">"when your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse cursor, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball."</seg>

<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"the solution for this problem is that you will do a mouse click yourself. by doing this, the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and use the cursor to another place."</seg>

<seg id="2521">"the intelligent moving is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible to use this way to copy it into the clipboard, or to use any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice on this:"</seg>
<seg id="2522">"do not use the intelligent slide when you just start using & kmousetool; use. instead, use a mouse click at the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again."</seg>
<seg id="2523">"use the audible mouseclick. by doing this, each time & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the intelligent move starts the shifting time. later, you can use the intelligent slide without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"to use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window, which should be the case on most systems."</seg>

<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"strings replaced parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for converting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form."</seg>

<seg id="2634">"each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to voice output. if the filter determines that its rules are not true, the text continues to be passed to the next filter."</seg>

<seg id="2935">"if & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only one memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2936">"the band-ID. the format of this string is the machine name: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds gone by the tape in which the tape was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">The task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and analysed using the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; features available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start tries & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol - to open. it will not be shown to you, and it opens itself instead of a small message box, so you have & ksystemlog; most probably do not have permission to read under Linux in the directory / var / log, for which normal user normally does not have permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or entered strings. the list of the protocol lines is now automatically changed, so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter. in default, a log line will only be shown if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be compared with the entries in the corresponding selected column. for example, in the log file system log, select the name of a process, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are displayed with a more eye-catching color than protocol lines of the level indication. the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off in alignment dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only a certain process (for example, in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines added."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might try to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformat. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this directory is named rc.d, etc., and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not contain such things as setserial, which only once started. such calls are named after rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have something confused, then you come to fix it by restarting the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter the l -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server runlevel running only httpd, sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; using a mouse or another time device is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry in the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only happen if you pull out an entry in the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. in order to only copy them to a new runlevel, you need to explicitly Copy the Edit menu or select from the context menu and add to the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently, there is no way to restore entries thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cutting to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to open the Properties dialog. use the tab button to change between different fields. enter the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are retrieved from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise it will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the presets are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runleveling, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"at the LILO prompt linux single, enter the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for executing under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using Delix; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present that are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) are simply terminated without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"to start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment by & kuser; to start reading."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry saving in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window consists of two map cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some map cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings. only when you activate space limitations (quota) for users, a map card will be created where you can make individual settings. more card cards appear if Shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd like in BSD-Unixes are installed."</seg>
