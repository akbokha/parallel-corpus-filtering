&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a law student , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was only reinforced . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very con@@ spic@@ uous love letter about its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; in his opinion he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and tuned in notes to him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican presidential elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated candidate ever . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which attracts people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; also he did not agree with the world outlook of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; at the game .
&quot; the intoler@@ ance is a contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump started his way to nom@@ inate repub@@ lican presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , broke my heart almost . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way . &quot;
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into account of the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that they have disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . d . ) : as much as &quot; whit@@ ening the wh@@ ites against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; pu@@ n @-@ game from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones said , has killed exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , a huge part of the White America receives this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word of speech with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now tr@@ umps country , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find any place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music through rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city Cat@@ eur@@ a together ?
&quot; the fact that the music played in both places has changed not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for several years now La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students became a central interest to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs ma@@ je@@ ure . &quot;
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope for the youth .
&quot; the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca n@@ vi : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ m@@ ble they learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , wood@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play . &quot;
music from Wa@@ ste
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically on the top of the largest land@@ fill in As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recycled instruments made of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion all made out of the tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the beginning time : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra playing instruments made of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ de@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about 1 billion tons of waste every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people of Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights the wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
re@@ publication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; back then , in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already undertaken illegal fishing in Liberia before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a perpetr@@ ator of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were swi@@ f@@ tly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to lease one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior worker of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , rec@@ alls . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not successful for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of the lo@@ oting of fish stocks in the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , in 2012 was founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that were driven by the Premier from their waters back then . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries like minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden , why it is extremely difficult to find out . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing ecosystem , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles , and also by the sn@@ ail pace , with the information between individual countries , the actions now happen in real time , with tr@@ ack@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspic@@ ious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , by means of satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspic@@ ious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads his caught fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license , where they were on the way and possibly , if they have a criminal case . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about substantial financial losses to the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i lose every year because of illegal fishermen who enter East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , present for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include , among others , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake lic@@ ences , specification of fan@@ ta@@ sies , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a un@@ broken organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in former times a ship could fish fishing and a country could say &apos; You couldn &apos;t run my port &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front functions . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspic@@ ious vessels . &quot;
&quot; it has discovered criminal networks that had spread counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to trace the illegal ships that love to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i provides technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be provided by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i should help to find criminal acting ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine conservation organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the position of every single trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that &apos;s just what makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and unite their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project to run where a global system allows tracking of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but they also deter them . &quot;
ships which had previously been fishing without a license and could hardly face consequences now know that they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH now have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets there , their use is forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces with the West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member country Somalia was able to report his first major triumph : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also steep@@ ed in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans is actually working in the entire cosmos . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . &quot;
&quot; her articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is sp@@ las@@ hed on : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of returning the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( example : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the reluc@@ tance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on the inauguration of many as the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and close a new governance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance between Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short SME@@ s ( about the round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on torture and a march to the Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government office , should continue to pers@@ ist . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

&quot; on Twitter , pictures that talk about con@@ front@@ ations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed promot@@ ers of the government , according to their own statements . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators attempted to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ alists do not have !
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which separates the amount of repression a day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for an official approval process - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :

&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which from their point of view has done little against the devastating economic crisis , and has preferred to c@@ log critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview conducted by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to join the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qu@@ ij@@ ano is now speaking against his father as part of the large La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investigated crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he watched at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Secret Service Department of 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , charged with kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and kidn@@ apping a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
&quot; all called him &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP systems . &quot;
don &apos;t pass that they will not take you one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
&quot; so he for@@ b@@ ade me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later , he took me to work at the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would become en@@ vy . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tort@@ ured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just anything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were removed and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a couch where people were tort@@ ured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; they seldom tie a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ it@@ alia . &quot;

the con@@ tention there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty p@@ ie .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell right away and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied together with hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay face down - everyone was captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
&quot; close to the entrance , people sat quietly on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said : &quot; &quot; what do you think , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero pit@@ ched a man there and killed .
&quot; according to the testimony of survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , was also indic@@ ted by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way where the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tort@@ ured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they were to be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War Cri@@ mes &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was at the military later , - I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war crimes are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badge that you have fought to an enemy you have fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and steal the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... then this is not a war matter but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; You who are sti@@ cking cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and scre@@ amed : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do so !
so was my father .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a roller @-@ collar shirt . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he nevertheless carried clothing home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ jur@@ er in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you can see the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
one could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ? &quot;
&quot; did these people not have families , who could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ? &quot;
the disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that man can do .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were grin@@ ded and disc@@ ar@@ ded somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought to display my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed atro@@ cious crimes and you were forced me as a child to participate .
he replied only &quot; Na then show me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
2010 I ref@@ unded the first ad .
finally I realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . finally , I have said to my own father . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 most severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old . &quot;

the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish on the order of magnitude of the judgment .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended due to crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims ultimately in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 Supp@@ or@@ ters were found guilty of crimes against humanity ; the Court suspended imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;

&quot; a translation mistake makes older people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where it is possible to extend its driving license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driving license , last month witnessed a very un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word was translated into the &quot; &quot; older car &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - maybe even with mal@@ icious h@@ ind and # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful driver &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photo portra@@ yed in the social media often .
&quot; the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , even if gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction of our part , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News dealt a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older driver in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the share of older motor@@ ists who are embro@@ iled in accidents nationwide , is definitely a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1.@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the name that was not named repor@@ ter brought comments to the light published on Yahoo , showing which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ eded against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo for the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; ) is not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and pro@@ active language skills to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language should not be in the initial language - not native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate the French into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , still leave translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and mysterious phrases , which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique cannot replace a human trans@@ lators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the wei@@ r@@ dest English phrases in Japan , among them also the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on Internet and television
&quot; homepage of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ O ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
other online transm@@ itters also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who resist@@ ed Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . &quot;
# Zen@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have hes@@ it@@ ant in the reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
I logged in to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
&quot; surprisingly , that it is still cheaper to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ O ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a web site is blocked by DNS , the server answers er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or ref@@ uses to request such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS spar@@ row : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third scre@@ ened channel , was hired on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was taken into custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an an access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other crimes committed to victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ mean for the family . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money gives her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more mature family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that children do not have to pay house@@ work for it , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot lift . &quot;
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
&quot; after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke to Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , gathered witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , for the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated to cri@@ adi@@ lla , in general , is guaranteed to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; can pass to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and whose exploitation is justified by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never know about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon witnessed in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adian in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant in the Population Register . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra proposed to Mar@@ ín on a stick until it suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported on the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the ma@@ iden &apos;s death .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and the photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; more cows than children are registered in Paraguay , &quot; says Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate children &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid examination of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl , who was their Cri@@ mel@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all the time and began to sell cand@@ y on the street or on the market , to earn money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time in such a way that she was still time to learn . &quot;
she arose every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , clean the fridge , clean the living room , polish the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had still had dinner for her employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she did not have an unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , standing next to him and reading edi@@ tori@@ als from op@@ positions like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he kept them intelligent , but didn &apos;t think with her . &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family , because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; bad habits there again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made it possible , &quot; she explains . &quot;
but she was totally clear that she had paid for everything she had from them with her hard work .
&quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the chic@@ anes that Cri@@ mean is exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not a group . &quot;

the society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning prob@@ es and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the Administrator of the group is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
&quot; Hi ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon . &quot;
for learning .
please log in .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad got five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a very old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the fibro@@ us of the ad switched on once more :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write once again , if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

bill dict@@ ates the Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; the regulations on the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if approved by the Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which is tas@@ ked with giving citizens a permission to give social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adop@@ ting the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six parag@@ rap@@ hs and cur@@ ses independent in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running and used via the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to make up registration . unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ adh Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to come through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level all around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that as much as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private rooms it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , this means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who apply for permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to supply them to a trial process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not at all realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislature &apos;s legislature and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mode of thinking in the Parliament , in whose senses the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no devi@@ ant nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifetime imprisonment for those suspected of threatening the &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; protest against protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an area in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the protective guard H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost @-@ like Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which wi@@ pes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; The Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard indeed in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza is passion@@ ately showing a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , documented the progress made over the past six years to re@@ build the life of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had stopped entire coastal towns from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma experienced a nuclear accident , for that reason 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which advances were achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the paper contains statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authorities as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , 77 per cent of the planned replacement units ( S@@ sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement units were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; still , six years after the disaster , one still stri@@ ves to reloc@@ ate ev@@ ac@@ uation of accommodation documents ( &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; k@@ az@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final surro@@ gate houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 more and more 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such accommodations . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation ne@@ sts after the disaster in government shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by cal@@ am@@ ity , opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian country , have been severely affected . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , whereby only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the atomic accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear blocking zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off . &quot;

&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants have been more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to establish an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
as it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also focused attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led into permanent spare houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the state of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation are still in residence , older than 50 years old . it is well known because efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;

&quot; when people from other countries encounter another language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global links are important since they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ano last Friday . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
on the pictures there is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a whi@@ p . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás admitted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the completion of the investigation of the incident from active service . &quot;
the pictures show police officers how he beats in Go@@ i@@ ano with his whi@@ p on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer would be beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ano , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ ters shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also reflected in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police action on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had erected a stage for speakers , rubber shells and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to for@@ ego violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once more , the Brazilian media sli@@ pped road protests by turning the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported about a broken glass window in order to design illustrations for illustr@@ ative fashion with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special thing .
you also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any form of material damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is an absurd , di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence in the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ations with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in Cuba opened doors in Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding that there are no notable sugar crops on site . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after laying down the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry doesn &apos;t ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene ref@@ uses to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harvest is no longer a news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old rail@@ road station of the municipality had already seen better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar rise in the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , published according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural prospects &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agriculture and food organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; which were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane items , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to maintain the location , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents , which would only be differentiated with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all of them were signed by Ul@@ ise Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters were getting more and more common . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation , &quot; he assured . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved against his will at the de@@ commissioning of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ station producers has been extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work stations and services generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane mills
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the crowd Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to kill them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ d the road , and this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without the prospects of the future , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; a food factory was created in the area , and production not even serves for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine ex@@ its brought the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month , to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ peti@@ tive person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him . &quot;
they torture him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes to retirement with 65 years , not because it lacks strength , but because it is bitter . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , workshop leaders bring mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ star . &quot;
&quot; the workshop focuses on the fact that young participants learn topics such as &quot; cultural identity , speech , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; highway of tears , &quot; a street in western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey , how important is the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people didn &apos;t always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the ref@@ rain is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dial@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever was interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
&quot; this is the day when you shall take our cry , &quot;
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe we will raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
this is how they can grow and continue our youth as well .
so they can do what they are destined to be the Creator .
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able writing ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) are exhibited by every dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers are looking at these plastic meals and then decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ ji district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes , which the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them any more . however , a new trend is now turned into show@@ y mobile gad@@ gets and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic bags decorated with plastic rib@@ bons as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ ots cooling cabinet mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part we made for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
&quot; some mobile stands and mobile designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon roe will be used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon roe . &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic bags may also accept a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes , look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # . &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers , &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ erable and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that brings this struggle with it . &quot;
&quot; coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches who have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug trafficking &quot; ) , which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear lives changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father looking for secret graves after his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing for the task that we have set ourselves , to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is with me here too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you stand for the insurance of my father , but they do not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a Re@@ aders of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I &apos;ve been familiar with disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for criminals or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person , who once belonged to that body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different here or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants him to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ icker ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; &quot; of the perpetr@@ ators when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is as if they mo@@ ck those who have lost someone , and those who have fear that something happens to them . &quot;
&quot; I see our weakness , when stories become mere figures in a statistic . &quot;
&quot; the fu@@ tility of the people is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village would be justified , that they were &quot; established . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to rec@@ ite that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four Mon@@ ths black@@ mail in the Capital Region : how a family has been pill@@ aged with threats . &quot; in it , she describes how armed criminals were black@@ ma@@ iled for a month &apos;s money until they had not only destroyed the business , but had torn apart her family . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain over it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as you do not know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I asked myself whether crying would resolve my deep roots feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how one we@@ pt . I must learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by force .
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement at the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , boil potatoes , make tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; &quot; ch@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able to a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , saw the bloody passion of his father shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Federal Council for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office t@@ abled 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ als per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories are alive in the face of ever @-@ new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tort@@ ured the country over the last four decades , in an understandable way . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which he links , contains images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the check @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something first appeared ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to photograph trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tank wagon was a victim . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball , who envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie nearby which was full of people watching the World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; an image with the title &quot; That &apos;s Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident are depic@@ ting the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lying on the ground while looking at them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been edited several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely as@@ cri@@ bed real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically about atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were scattered , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be visually displayed . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from DR Congo showed up again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ de@@ mean@@ ings ; Africa Check has documented Zu@@ agen@@ das on Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one more step further , personal comments , such as this example fal@@ si@@ fy the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who could flee were blows , rape and several dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts were like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ dic @-@ Arab news site , which in 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to view this information . &quot;
&quot; the original article , which was last accessed April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , which called AF@@ P as their source , had wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein Sein this statement , but had not associated the picture from DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide coverage of wrong information
traces of this false Cou@@ pling extend back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; reverse image search , &quot; one can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as dated May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the reported picture from DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private pages , platforms of social media and common and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we have limited examples of ab@@ usive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on what they have been published on which side they have been published . &quot;
several examples of ab@@ usive use may come from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been inter@@ connected ) .
here are some cases which can now be completely r@@ acked ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; the orange @-@ coloured countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ts or fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; gray countries are examples which , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are probably also exemplary . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City not only identifies the false announcement , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo became a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of a mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted , because the photos were ab@@ usive . &quot;
&quot; UK , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government published a statement about what they had as &quot; deliberately f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot;

&quot; this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims killing Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news site , unfortunately , claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news channel An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture was later turned into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ dung y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the DR Congo saw it , equipped with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and saved more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false announcement . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image from DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;

frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( framed ) that go through these posts . the first frame focused on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and do it dimin@@ ish the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ semination of forc@@ eful images has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a refusal is to acknowledge the tragedy . at times , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent pictures of readers and spectators des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media interact to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about for@@ ci@@ ble portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are essential for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists have experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used by the context or completely ab@@ usive nature . &quot;
&quot; however , every examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons using the CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. in@@ ex@@ changeable ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
&quot; these words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these conf@@ using words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese su@@ bre@@ da@@ de ) and others which are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist persistent every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes somewhat context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you will find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - In@@ cre@@ ase your parents in recognition of how they have tried to keep you in your younger years .
words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Birds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they s@@ ander other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impressive are these small languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka changes with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earthquake disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which is normally in use at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement by the Sri Lanka disaster centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were missed because of floo@@ ds and mud winds . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been brought to 304 secure sites . &quot;
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water conditions in some areas slowly returned . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka have regularly updated the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , warns the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the last @-@ beaten water peg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made to transport emergency supplies for the residents of the floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also been willing to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for anyone who wants to don@@ ate dry foods and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ ach@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ thal@@ mic Center is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded for free to the Sri Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also launched a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; key , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and help help . &quot;
&quot; this prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;
what you can &apos;t see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her my four years old daughter , she trust@@ s me her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
in the last minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; in the next , we are campaig@@ ning for rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head blanket high , bound from an American flag , others ch@@ ill slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception . &quot;
they dism@@ iss me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different kind . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination , that as soon as Muslims , like I do not fit there , are dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot;
to be dism@@ issed
I am not alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of him when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western concept , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ compos@@ es the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years , and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings and forced Saudi and Muslim women to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , which cause movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it also points out that the first Muslim prayers were spoken by Afri@@ cans , who had been brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it er@@ ases the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ ed that often Sik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and chic@@ an@@ ings .
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belonged
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations that will help us understand the world .
and my industry has f@@ abul@@ ously failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims account for the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of all Muslim populations are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time when Khan re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now the inevitable Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some bag , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ est , we do not carry all the pick@@ pockets with us . &quot;
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islamic refin@@ ement machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell , and because of the way we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger who tear@@ es up the veil of a woman . &quot;

I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but being a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they approach the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when she could look through the 15 meters concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I was silent in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab verses to the protection which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and evil that you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim adher@@ ence is always part of my shadow . &quot;

being Muslim means speaking the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; being Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah is what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - over centuries - been colon@@ ised by a &quot; empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name Ehr@@ worthy Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that , fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent , apart from the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy takes the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave . &quot;
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into that country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .

it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple strings , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a cube @-@ cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build struc@@ turally Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; struc@@ turally Islam hos@@ tility is made in Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries that are bombing it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely accepts Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we cast off on Muslim lands .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically correct picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;

we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we are decades back to recognise the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expressions that we are ste@@ aling in our news editorial offices .

and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;

&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of being conscious and un@@ conscious of the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no President , the chocolate cake , while he has already broken down countries and &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;

initiative for Nar@@ r@@ ative Art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling Initiative ( T@@ LS ) , is a possible answer to the story of stories in their original language . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the conf@@ using blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , accept diversity - secure spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated with understanding , &quot; &quot; use these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to feel , to make sense . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first interpret their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their dedication and representation will lead to the audience . &quot;
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ gat@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ gat@@ ara asks : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide smile , he shares his sense of inclusion : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; until now , Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling has taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend it . all those who are inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the United States re@@ election of sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , on 3 April 2017 , various religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tori@@ a Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil war for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ determination of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
&quot; the people Puerto Rico demand that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities responsible for the debt will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm commitment to our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with decl@@ ining reti@@ re@@ es .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not integrated into the U.S. territory - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; measures imposed extern@@ ally will run without the participation and conviction of citizens , to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration wore the name &quot; night thing for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for more than a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , devoted itself to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive inquiry . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here licence @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of repression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and what the real costs are to which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to make some sense out of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who have been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to reflect on their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison , a non @-@ military unit , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; b@@ ass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal in his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his place of residence and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer in the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the general public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ hir &apos;s cultural prototypes were more predictable than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of many civi@@ liz@@ ations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to em@@ body this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life of dre@@ aming of freedom , and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
&quot; I am overwhel@@ med , if I call his name . &quot;
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in custody . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding them in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a commission which she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ ged the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them out of Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty free .
book Cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and guards &quot;
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I jump into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; that I wear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile over your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year goes , my soul &quot;
during the evening
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still In the cage of monsters
Bas@@ que &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the 2011 protests against Assad &apos;s Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tort@@ ured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , Am@@ nesty International died in detention at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
&quot; since 2012 , the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of b@@ asset . &quot;
&quot; today , we repeat our call for the hope that we have to do for the last time . &quot;
Mozambique : re @-@ accused of corruption after the release of corruption
&quot; with indign@@ ation , Mos@@ ambi@@ cans re@@ acted with anger against corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is the case of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defend@@ ants because of im@@ pending 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800@@ ,000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from Mozambique airports , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his res@@ ignation to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a position of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which adverti@@ sed the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , to refer back to his old posts , as the company did not undergo any discipline after his imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not accept the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution supporting public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the Director in an interview with Deutsche Welle . &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the firm should have a disciplinary trial against the in@@ res@@ isti@@ ble .
&quot; the company seems , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , also decl@@ ines this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of them served . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director does not have any morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that one was rewarded in such a way that the state has already massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks the morality to return and serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served itself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t pre@@ fers it to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es are in the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mozambique channel will not only be remembered as the first independent President , but also as a keen , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic red@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is simultaneously criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were rejected as well : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
the word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ port@@ ed &quot;
&quot; according to data by Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took off their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; escap@@ ade &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely de@@ preci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically utter@@ ed by hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the Word , or have expressed doubts about their use . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same characters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( column ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar pair &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the proposition ku la - &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the Ques@@ tion ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese , resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook needed to be analytical before putting all the posts suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words .
&quot; for example , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ ect@@ ins &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; ( ages ) . &quot;
&quot; good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to cur@@ tail their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all , spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and the song , posting and sharing of content was forbidden for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards did not ent@@ ail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred in the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the dist@@ orted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun via Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .

&quot; post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to hei@@ ghten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure , the spreading hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better on context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice so that the sal@@ able age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN child rights convention , the min@@ ors as , , every person under 18 years of age . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children , who were already married to 15 , was in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical centre office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , striving to abol@@ ish laws for the marriage of children , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced greatly . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for instance , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this sort of religious opposition has caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts have come to see if the opposition would agree to the bill in general . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law announce .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle again posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it .
&quot; once it has been decre@@ ed in Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users were enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws on the marriage were finally amended .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk disgu@@ ised to the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot; &quot; outstanding News ! &quot;
the sp@@ ouses have been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; following the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a civil society group that openly talked about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the market@@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amend@@ ment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was approved today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties and 35 of them were present in the vote . &quot;
all the dep@@ u@@ ties who were opposed have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ ag@@ ei@@ sm .
many thanks to all the activists who have fo@@ stered it .
heart@@ y congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; but a potential hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the best @-@ known Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished to approach the issue differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; rather , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that only panic and dis@@ grace can evo@@ ke us , instead of talking about the problem , that the state , our daughters , prevents them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ beaten men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage in different degrees is legal or still the norm although there are laws that they say . &quot;
H@@ acker rolls the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in front of nationwide protests on the Russian national holiday
&quot; screen print of the news posted on Sunday , early on the Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l public prosec@@ utor &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ ded with Russia &apos;s day - the Russian national holiday - the website of the Prosecutor was h@@ acked by the Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l district . &quot;
or we bring you to the jail instead of Dim@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ackers posted the YouTube video &quot; &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; &quot; the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office calls on citizens to not follow the pro@@ vocation and keep away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot;
&quot; at 11.15 , the message was removed from the side - but it remained intact in the buffer . &quot;
it is # gently disappeared !
&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor informed the local news service Yar@@ Faith that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , inten@@ tionally to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally obsc@@ ured . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month , Turkey now blocks the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series fight against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using block tools for blocked websites ( an updated article in the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) have appeared . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform hosted all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer machine connections ) , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; the content is , however , illegal in spite of the legal ban . &quot;
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after having heard the news ( about blocking Wikipedia ) , we put all the snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation of nature
&quot; a Su@@ hl@@ ende N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poor@@ ly positioned motives and washed colours .
the motivated him to wear a camera and try to engra@@ ve the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him :
&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard was le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was in and immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fri@@ ghtening as they look like .
&quot; and he ought to know &#91; it &#93; , for he had already stood face to face with tig@@ ers : &quot;
a tiger cannot be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ ster appeared . &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for promoting Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take photos of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist information . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ rah@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women are avoiding the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband and fear the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and rejected by her family and village community after addressing a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of her wives also does not name the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less allow@@ ances to fear if any , they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff as well as house@@ wives , came to a unique club and thus became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them only in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and is committed to the exploitation of patri@@ archy . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage , up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this club . &quot;
she tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of the change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its panel discussion was of women who do not mention their hus@@ bands by name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open a conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; the name of their hus@@ bands does not speak lou@@ dly , is a custom , which they all du@@ ly perpet@@ u@@ ate and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name before , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him on his name from now on . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the start of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ o from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women should never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , she had only ch@@ oked her ; another decided to release all the frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation generated violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the sp@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot , if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to vote for themselves , not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip for every discussion club . &quot;
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &apos;s going on , &quot; she says . &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since they were married .
&quot; most of them are okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ one @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants ; they didn &apos;t dare to be dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of one &apos;s choice of clothing , the mor@@ ale linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a panel discussion so that the women could wear it . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say their husband &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear zinc @-@ red on their forehead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as the sp@@ eil@@ ings for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a hard to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

bald men are kidn@@ apped and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .
&quot; photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of ab@@ duction of non @-@ headed people for organ trading , presum@@ ably for super@@ l@@ ative purposes , distur@@ bs the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans are being used in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; according to local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man @-@ headed man could contain gold or bring wealth , the spokes@@ person of the police said Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , which is the target of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who were planning to travel to the country :
&quot; bew@@ are of bald men who travel to Mozambique , men of bald men in Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane south of Mozambique , said that the local police had already followed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of common individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for presum@@ ably lu@@ dic@@ rous rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty confron@@ ting Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I like M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE like to be ashamed A country where people would have shame to go on the streets , to demand sex against good notes , and to make their own lives in order to earn their bread , a country where people would not hurt dish@@ on@@ or or even their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald for super@@ l@@ ative purposes or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; are hun@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss a chance for mac@@ ab@@ re humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the leader of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro S@@ app@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ person Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after he was involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department of China described Li@@ us &apos;s case as an internal affair and nar@@ rates a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Li@@ u &apos;s case . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment if the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot;
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into a shock after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to re @-@ record the salmon exports to China as exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
&quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his price in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his / her price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament approved a decision by which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as she said in an explanation on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits that they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA ( Germany )
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P announced on 27 June that the message of the Chinese authorities to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US Embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere with a single and ir@@ responsible commentary on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley informed that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to impose the Chinese government on it , release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese president Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had big concerns if the ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada : Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u an appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;

&quot; Canada is calling on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom of expression . &quot;

France &apos;s foreign ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family are to have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information on whether France will eventually commen@@ ce it . &quot;
Taiwan Electric
&quot; the Council of land@@ land@@ affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called upon China to permit the ill @-@ intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; in an explanation on June 28 , the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; the question may seem sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level . &quot;
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons mentioned by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; given that he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old Lei@@ er re@@ appears from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic as they fit better with their power . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ responses . &quot;
he disgu@@ ised corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to en@@ ligh@@ ten this point , if he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the criticism that one should start reading the entire address of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; was not a country , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam as a leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review outlines the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam be &quot; ben@@ ign one mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian slip @-@ over ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is both country and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the Cabinet &apos;s cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must our Prime Minister pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a town / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; etc , but this is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers are published here as part of an ongoing series with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I am answering . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication then follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that differenti@@ ates us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans put a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex mar@@ riages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; everyone seems to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I admire very much . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t mind if I would be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; nice &quot; means basically to be fun - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really was a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; being inno@@ cu@@ ous , is un@@ ob@@ tr@@ usive and un@@ interesting to be and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada a sexy one .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band known in Thailand has released a music video that is par@@ o@@ ding the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to dominate the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) by the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the instructions he makes his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video on the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 254 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as regards the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has pursued in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 Rules of the Girl &quot; may refer to the dra@@ kon@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army an absolute decision about important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; change Your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious Programme for &quot; Adjust@@ ment Change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that over@@ sees online content and persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy to prosec@@ ute the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ingly opposed to the &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Great Scor@@ ing of the Great ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; the video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs became members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ sch@@ ha@@ zia , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russia and ha@@ v@@ ens live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people living here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the area amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after barely increasing over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area . &quot;

&quot; all this is a result of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ k@@ ovo , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are tr@@ apped and quite rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with burnt glory buildings .
people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v @-@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; as they discover me with the camera in their hand , they withdraw instantly . &quot;
&quot; our mother for@@ b@@ ade us to let us photograph , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the laps .
&quot; in winter , the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family , and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; called aun@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A her . &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ational partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , she reminds herself of the village life before the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative headquarters in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was located , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chick@@ ens . &quot;
she tells us that it was a very fri@@ ghtening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has more to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right to them .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were .
&quot; when our conversation ends up , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball now .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones onto the fallen buildings . &quot;
these ruins are a part of their childhood which cause in@@ adver@@ t@@ edness in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
&quot; on the path of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname has been owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on their journey .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people come to full mini@@ buses and from the top part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cart@@ ons outside . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medication that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chic@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston , to find her husband and the three children there . &quot;
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he says that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the track , and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ ened , he started his journey into the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he replies , smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that her guests often send text messages , when they are gone to greet them or to report about their journey . &quot;
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are being sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled from people in Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him a roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
&quot; in the courses , the travellers call quietly their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she sings in her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots she made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly as she briefly introduces her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them each time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;

&quot; on July 10th , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a phone notification in which they announced the District Government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app will &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous underground of the Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would investigate and trace the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Troj@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ackers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet on Twitter , published on Twitter , published the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be det@@ ained up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have forced people to use appliances , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment through the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; 中@@ 文 &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can up@@ lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the directions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of cy@@ ber security office during operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; an up @-@ to @-@ date report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published an ordin@@ ance on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi by order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you watch and realize that you are alone in a place where all the important things have disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth which is clearly recognis@@ able , both from inside and from outside . &quot;
one who makes their name all honor .
one who has defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth moves on the axis of the disaster . it becomes clear to you that here you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone built . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that did not suff@@ ice so that I &quot; learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
&quot; during a peaceful protest , five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
&quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ orten the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all quarters of the city desired , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was still , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put any high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a sum@@ p@@ tuous picture that fulfilled my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice , after you put it all the way up to the office of security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear , as you cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
and you &apos;re sorry about looking into my eyes and not on the ground !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never ceased to look into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his Father equally with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition lies in my nose until today .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture which I was subjected to months . &quot;
I ran through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ eive all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise , they have probably allocated me a larger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and I am allowed to sit immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I grab@@ bed an old @-@ tried communication method : hitting the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ share was a &quot; &quot; pre@@ acher &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me ultimately . &quot;
&quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle aged man who resembles me similarly and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there are no prominent fac@@ tions in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all responses deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ew all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured on the fruit in my head &apos;s garden . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them cry &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the cry , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black is the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be inter@@ rog@@ ated .
&quot; thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al press card and betra@@ yed the narrow view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; here is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I looked at the audi@@ torium and meet on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems like that . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ive from him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can get so much more important with your life than to join these day @-@ th@@ iev@@ es and protest against demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I have become accustomed to not responding .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , though I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aking .
your hang@@ man rejo@@ ic@@ eth in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot keep your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not fall to him yet , why they exchanged the reed by a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked out as a garbage collector earlier or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a huge cable , from their point of view . &quot;
within a single hour three of them switched off while I was still at the row .
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find a favor on it why he was next to an electri@@ cally charged stick .
&quot; electricity fed all my body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , lying out@@ stretched on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours went out , which happened to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ass@@ fu@@ cian . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk , you will be laid . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , time to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s family had to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ lows ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist against the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ tried views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls out the heart of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special aff@@ ection against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he den@@ otes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; during that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from dawn to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the s@@ lei@@ ades speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ C@@ igar@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some Members of Parliament , who support the Islamic Democratic Front - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front timi@@ d Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert evening . &quot;
the dep@@ u@@ ties and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had just been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and Freedom of Expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the well @-@ tried legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la valued the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simply a rhetor@@ ic , but actually reflecting a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b used traditional sex men to be dead by depic@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently d@@ ashed unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they actually trust . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; Hon@@ our kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still more difficult that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law bann@@ ing crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can be held in prison for in@@ definite time , and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee from the family that nothing will happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity , and is well @-@ known to not shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but adm@@ its that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man . &quot;
&quot; politics in@@ tru@@ ded me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse repeatedly repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and each other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ believe , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay people and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn out of context , twi@@ sted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without any cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ die , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do it ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , stating that they had critical comments on the issues raised in the country with the corruption that were rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , street uni@@ tions and artificial democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to expand and consequently resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is believed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the solid cars , the drums and dancing have been delivered over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies swe@@ pt from the west of Japan to the north @-@ east to comp@@ el the indigenous population of the region , the Emis@@ hi . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to pick some great seats , so we had a great view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two solid cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high solid car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans s@@ wap arms against sc@@ iss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; it is rare that outer appearance and personal care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate job like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are all day . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru experiences - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has made that more and more normal people go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the contest of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts face each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric characters , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile of Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain a training in hair@@ dres@@ sers instead of bad advice , allowing them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young@@ sters have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their achievements :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , for from love to children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with kind permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; Love messages to Guer@@ illa fighters , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve released . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel exp@@ elled , aff@@ ection@@ ate aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters of reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the cl@@ ue of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the treaty of peace was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services . &quot;
&quot; before Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , it is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhetor@@ ic , and around the clock , have to integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which has accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now take into their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans should join together and help in the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society . &quot;
&quot; the goal of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who are to be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea of reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for the former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to convey the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we delivered the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , as next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gr@@ en@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him quite hard and seated me beside the gar@@ net .
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , he was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hunger death . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to handle weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as a war , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret . &quot;
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state was imp@@ acting to the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no electoral rights , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings , have been turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans have been prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ armament there would have been peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities there will always be people who are willing to take up arms , to rise and to protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; gay and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; but the threat posed like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ess compl@@ aining about the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , has not only come about overnight . &quot;
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
&quot; several months ago , the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines after reports have been published that address the deportation , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspic@@ ious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced by the sexual equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the USA in the last analysis . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from my car back seat , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but didn &apos;t hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you Sch@@ and@@ stain ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and finally wo@@ ke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming .
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two sore thro@@ es in my right lung . &quot;
OC Media : in which cases have you been laid - in which men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , my male name stands on it , but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they said absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have Bas@@ ket size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only sh@@ amed your family , but the whole republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother got too much and she put a rope around my neck .
&quot; fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window there was a car with a dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a plate with a 95 cm plate .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; just before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without registering myself , without identification , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
&quot; only to prove it to you , it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not speak about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o issue . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements within me .
&quot; as much as I wish for , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person who reminds her from her past - that is , my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed d@@ ort@@ on ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report last week in Washington .
for me I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no man was arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not stop a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; with that , I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there even gay men det@@ ained in these pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there &apos;s just not so many .
&quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to present themselves Kad@@ y@@ rows dish . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people had not simply disappeared , but sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is that only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for a and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after growing their be@@ ard .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . we assume that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know , whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already taken place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think before 2003 , I was already known in Gros@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in seri@@ ousness !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; originally , but ultimately pushed us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria never hurt me just one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is : &quot; Sp@@ otte is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say it to children when they laugh about the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could sense how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , looked at himself with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
during the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deterior@@ ating . &quot;
OC Media : what action do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ iter .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 Dollars per month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t spend a cent for that .
I discovered these people myself as I grab@@ bed influ@@ xes .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is just the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam before the mouth , that there are no bo@@ ils in them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the Cab@@ ar@@ ers have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that . &quot;
I met so many men out of the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , restored the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran that is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to pay for his family , so Ah@@ mad &apos;s human rights groups who would like to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube gave the moments after he ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly cleared the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad minority , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family patri@@ cians , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to follow their families because of the persecution of the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy took over power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in all Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated disease , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime is systematically den@@ ying the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a multitude of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co @-@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; thus , a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti @-@ Arab discrimination . &quot;
&quot; because function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their native Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pro@@ s and sur@@ names in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names at work are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activ@@ ist alert before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist in general .
&quot; for example , in spite of the same education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and triple among them . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black c@@ is women , on black transi@@ den@@ te women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been suffering from racial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my master &quot; &quot; in order to attain equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of racial motiv@@ ating violence that we face black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and country of origin deserve less than white men and women .
&quot; black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk , to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , which ref@@ uses to take into account ine@@ qualities in her thinking , which relate to both the gender and the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will not fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , which has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again and again . &quot;
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained about 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is a men@@ th@@ less and margin@@ alised being in a historical sense . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different poss@@ essions a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres , which are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : recall ourselves : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
&quot; due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman , I am acknowledged as a part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ dle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about international efforts to resolve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern throughout the Kurdist@@ an area in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
&quot; in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution upon his church . &quot;
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmm@@ aker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persec@@ uted , poor@@ ly respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of oppressed communities that can tell their stories in their way . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er , which reports about violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been modified to protect the affected individuals .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the ac@@ ten@@ tious indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman returned to her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women first report ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; accounting 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system , that nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were charged with domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came from . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; on every woman who adver@@ ts in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who adver@@ ts for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; declared her end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then she still looked after . this should always regret her . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she has endu@@ red mental violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to know : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would once be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , among them Carlos himself . he asked rhetor@@ ically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed it for so long , and didn &apos;t leave it earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse would at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women , all of whom are victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ an case , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot;
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; the authorities stayed with the authorities without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of ab@@ uses is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the United Nations Organization for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ tob@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non @-@ inti@@ mid@@ ating ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal off@@ ence and pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ ly as it is the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legislative text has been modified in some points to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law , who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be level@@ ed , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill envis@@ aged most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must present the victims of violence themselves , if they just want to report ad and obtain a secure housing to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away . &quot;
we must reimbur@@ se such a long indication until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the passage concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law applies however as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after bann@@ ing a newspaper continue to attack targets
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison where he ban@@ ishes a one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dism@@ issed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to its role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief Command of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the insi@@ di@@ ous efforts of security forces , especially domestic intelligence , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , including freedom of the press , and independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to torture , inti@@ mid@@ ate and det@@ ained . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to freedom of the press in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported about corruption in Oman since its founding in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties to the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; this was about corruption in the Judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board of Directors , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested upon arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS found the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the paper was concluded in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper on any way , including online , will be banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at . &quot;
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the paper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted , inter alia , because of disturb@@ ance of the public order , &quot; &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a ban on public@@ ity and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 US Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2,@@ 600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; &quot; an information network to spread the material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damages deposit of 5000 US dollars was established ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i was released on 10 April 2017 following the sentence of his six month prison sentence from prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his 1 @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information , issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information , personally , signed a further statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , making the Minister another time against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ publish the publication of the paper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
&quot; additional injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to susp@@ end their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
&quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial cler@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and freedom of expression and the right to gather , support and protect them . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines missing on the global health care market that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have a far more serious impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps in building their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed a serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discusses the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understanding of the media on this research . &quot;
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment my work focuses on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ish national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
&quot; GV : in your opinion , what are the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa ? &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that has to change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being M@@ acher himself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not previously have ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from it . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are only accessible for payment ( the so called &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the US to India : how open @-@ source seed producers are changing global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published on solutions for environmental issues around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salad since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only limited by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of salad he can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the millennium , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents g@@ aged not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants like cer@@ eal or cart@@ el species . due to these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds salad , but it now needs longer since his work is still more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der lying around which I have to yo@@ del .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , nobody can breed a new salad variety because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and endeav@@ oured to use no material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Rö@@ mer@@ salad of the variety Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . it is tested there if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , shortly O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed it , and not immediately Pyrenees - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the Emer@@ ging professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ di@@ son and O@@ SS@@ I board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
&quot; food sovereignty , without seed sovereignty , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative undertake to release their seeds freely , in contrast to patent seeds and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited available . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SS@@ I , deals with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that massive cultivated plants such as wheat , are patented in an even greater scale than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those who have improved their taste or colour to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for gro@@ wers is decl@@ ining by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more urgent than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predic@@ tible . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts the notion that intellectual property initi@@ ates other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
&quot; so , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees it differently : 20 years to wait for a patent to take place , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been common and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ ed with the concept of creating plant features : &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants they form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds one sort , also breeds his own values in it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with great hum@@ ps and mono@@ cultures , for which cultivation are needed masses of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is contrary to gent@@ l@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who are active on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it creates most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant breeders Frank Mort@@ on is searching for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on also believes that gro@@ wers would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition , which makes it quite simply beautiful . &quot; worldwide response &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be the leader in &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also supports them to get to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for gro@@ wers in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding differ from country to country , why the O@@ SS@@ I obligation can not simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia , on farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for which scheduled next year should be the official starting signal . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international Non@@ profit Development Agency US@@ C Canada and the Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that soon more people will recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has focused mainly on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights Organisation and Blog are the latest destinations of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend around May 5th , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities were sharply critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; despite this attack and the spot@@ ting of the Egyptian right and the Constitution by the authorities who actually defend the law , it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exploited to overcome and not to give up . we ins@@ ist on further fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network of Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of Web site lock@@ ings to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researchers Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became even the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada alien@@ ated the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to block blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if blocking the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; I have managed to convey the feeling of a si@@ ege to me ; an arrest , a temp@@ ted murder , summ@@ ons on the national Security Council , the blocking of blogs , as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it for posting articles to b@@ ypass cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , there were 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; it also documented the block@@ age of vendors by which Internet access and private browsing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web sites , which offer V@@ PN@@ s , began . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis by which they can proceed in court against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day newspapers in all Brazil reports with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer will be killed in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tight financial situation the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio 2017 .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the magazine &quot; Extra &quot; published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; it will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . everything but what happens in Rio will be published in the &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the paper continues to write : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , who first shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and their partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it does ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued about violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and self @-@ p@@ aced neg@@ lect of public service . &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

&quot; calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics of 2015 . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data available . &quot;
none of these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the Mor@@ de@@ ans per federal state , Rio is on No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is an extra part of the company &apos;s largest media company , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; this security policy also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit issued by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police task and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited in one of his articles from 2010 , where he explains why violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio will also cause serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; mistaken spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
a week it is now that the police cleared the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit merchant died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by Assad &apos;s regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and surrounding area , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre had been committed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under si@@ ege outside Damascus , causing residents to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the long @-@ standing block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ mics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the common foods in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P , the French news agency : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in homes and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more awareness . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o is used . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la on Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this Article , they have achieved more than 100 % of their expected target of some 12,@@ 700 € but will continue to collect donations to cand@@ o by Monday , September 4 , 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally made plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began producing fung@@ i seeds from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom court in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta for free . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a greater movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the fung@@ al breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of the si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ supply by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cart@@ on , etc ) to produce new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege are visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for victims of 2017 &apos; fires
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires , which in the week before in the north of Portugal gr@@ aced . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state of state last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; fires have also been registered in Gal@@ icia , Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 frac@@ tures that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured were injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system that monitors forest areas via satellite imag@@ ery alone in 2017 alone , some 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread on the web and show pictures that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the call for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ IP of the Association of farmers in Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday , they did not do so anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits are questioned in places with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; an extensive proposal for the wh@@ ale reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article in the paper of P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to expand after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the Portugal Civil Defence on 15 and 16 October , as citizens searched or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used the own civilian protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial that the server did not stop the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son any more - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break open . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .
the city of G@@ haz@@ ni in Afghanistan .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ bollah @-@ dominated party of Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly feeling def@@ enc@@ eless . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked in a coal mine for a few years . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars who were more difficult than himself to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , Afghan refugees in Iran have been shaped by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran solely through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid need@@ y twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high levels of rein@@ forcement . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his un@@ restra@@ ined way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af , soon to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis track record is now subject to documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some Afghan companies have ar@@ isen , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant deals with the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals range far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there &apos;s a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and cann@@ ing techniques . &quot; thus they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .
&quot; citizen &apos;s report : draft laws from Egypt allow de@@ activation of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;
photo of @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 on Twitter shared .
&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ eds report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users must register to be able to use the social networks , within six months of successful legislative resolution on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
anyone who fails this step may be sentenced to six months imprisonment or the ex@@ propri@@ ation of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was adverti@@ sed by sixty members of the Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , is currently before a legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of parliament submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties to ins@@ ult the president or senior officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the off@@ ending of the president and state institutions is already criminal . under the law proposal , however , such a act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photos on 13 August 2013 , while expos@@ ing violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; according to Sha@@ w@@ kan , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a court . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the imprisonment of the human rights groups failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty as a result of one , so many human rights groups agree , such as weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and su@@ iting murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary free . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists listening to scann@@ ed documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been inter@@ rog@@ ated on a le@@ w@@ aged plan of action . said plan was supported by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial bill of action by the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused of corruption . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legislative template look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aned the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating the article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Council , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he acted as a witness in the district court in Tunis on May 9th . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new provisions of the Information Bureau of the Public Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is stated that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts expect that by doing so the elimination of anonymous comments should be reached within social networks . it &apos;s unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; in the social media , Chinese citizens have proposed to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizens journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ or of Russia shut its access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the Land government as the &quot; organis@@ er of the dis@@ semination of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a law of 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; release of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make ob@@ ses@@ sive services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently belong to websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ n@@ ol@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court dispos@@ es of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court had Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the data , Turkey supported the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is completely blocked the website . it is thus , among other things China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can not stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
&quot; following this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation on increased surveillance authorities that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install InterBase programs to de@@ cryp@@ t the data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted tel@@ cos and intelligence services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
