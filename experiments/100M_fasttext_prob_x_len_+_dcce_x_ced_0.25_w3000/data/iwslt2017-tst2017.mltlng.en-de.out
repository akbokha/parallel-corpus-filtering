this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones by Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation , in which the CIA literally sur@@ rendered designs for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not coinci@@ de at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been determined against Ris@@ en and called upon it to name its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became the symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive such information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they knew for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on cracks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and sources can still hide themselves less and less .
&quot; instead of failing and tears for statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his phone number secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit return , and even travel tips with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and rift source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers during his accession , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of having a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ om going to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all of them . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist , as Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source communication system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot store any information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technological separ@@ ators like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to use mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; or a Wall Street @-@ Insider , who warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks again .
&#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sag@@ a Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a brief insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ sag@@ a Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is said that a track of $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of child days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous on the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agency or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ pt away from you , me , common people . &quot;
why should that be ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it to me like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are less reports in the US about this matter .
&quot; probably because there were no prominent Americans so far , who came in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have ties in the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some U.S. states there is less information needed to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring some suspic@@ ious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked us , that all of us went to a lawyer to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single leader in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to overcome this , we must change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a safe optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen demonstrations of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political awareness by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has been in central regi@@ sters on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress which we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies .
we need managers in the economy who are standing up and saying : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit themselves to ending this type of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stood and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Look , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I burn myself ? &quot;
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , my toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people , who were sold as strangers in childhood , were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; as I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my ro@@ ommate runs out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ette ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door to the castle fell , Brian and I started . &quot;
did we just discover that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came into rolling .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it .
&quot; thus we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , people can then invite strangers to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to fire .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , one contempl@@ ates the things that one can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design do such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the unlock cell of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; so , who now has Al Gor@@ es mobile ? &quot;
could you please tell us that he is can@@ di@@ zed for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told him , wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to hand over your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their ratings before we placed them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are about age and residence .
we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three ratings , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if one has more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation prov@@ okes simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get out of it . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you too much , such as : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le art works in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to abandon those prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly : a need , which had not been met before . &quot;
the business runs very well for us .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million communicated over@@ nights had a problem . &quot;
for people trusted one another .
&quot; when trust works , there can be wonderful results . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one right . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring you books . &quot;
you can stay even longer without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay is running . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but now just call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is comparable to fast food . it is efficient and reliable but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group there would be waiting to fill one thoroughly and show one in a pub @-@ tour quarter of which one has never heard of it ; &quot;
or if you could learn to cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would create apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
are now offered residents . students who were looking for a residence
&quot; were convey@@ ed to people whose children had moved out , and incub@@ ator programs were launched . &quot;
&quot; to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
there was also a hospitality beforehand .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find that amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
every time I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da drives over to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for soon . &quot;
thanks again .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; studies show : Americans think , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself . &quot;
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , which I as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to suit a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought after , posed into question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone takes you , you fully understand , and yet loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disturb@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do such things ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... &quot; Middle @-@ origin ... &quot; , &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds turned me from others by a citizen to a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the US Mid@@ west to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I was rolling around -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ in . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; stay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t sl@@ um@@ ber you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims congreg@@ ate for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings came out : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I got mad about the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love issues . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my community like a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be seen under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks again !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Savi@@ or and Olympi@@ oni@@ as . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; there may be some parking spaces free , but not stopping the terror . &quot;
&quot; regular visits to a mos@@ que leads to a better look at people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alisation process one has noticed that it begins online . first , the person will be cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts group thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add ourselves to the world of imagination , if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks again !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it does not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; everyone cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that gave her mind to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m made the connection with God and their church again .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she kept to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear we pass at least three things .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itarian regime , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you submit a test person news , in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims went up@@ side -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can indeed be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
&quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the most sweet@@ est , generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has I become such a young man of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne by her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , killed her , as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided to visit the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child seat we went sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and drew off my shoes , and went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks a lot !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia ! you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with depth , so work in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study of Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people like an exception are usually appearing , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is shortly before becoming a billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air par@@ ting entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began flying with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the closest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ contained structures .
&quot; they have learned to wear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must be collec@@ tively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , i.e. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; landing &quot; . &quot; &quot;

a flight device trying to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
&quot; like other starter motors , it is efficient in the down@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of h@@ edges is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device no matter what location the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
bye B@@ ye Su@@ i@@ Princess
&quot; during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts coming together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies with only one worked . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and lateral ru@@ dder , no other actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and can move everywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear window . in order to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of throwing it right , if all look , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the monster is an exercise in tri@@ b@@ ulation , this machine is here , the Omni@@ bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , it receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly from flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this is clock@@ wise .
and the other against clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expressions . &quot;
we took commercially available Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine here wants to be a fli@@ ck@@ ering lamp shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled each other in a very distant galax@@ y , they walked so the mass of three suns in a tenth of a tenth of pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , they were shining bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; first , we arrange the events tempor@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; about 1.3 billion years ago , a single @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided particularly courage@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ zing black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the Lig@@ o Det@@ ector : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o now .
&quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ pi@@ ating black holes through the earth er@@ ased . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my father @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , that was the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories such as Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a shell in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers often lead a really al@@ ber@@ ant dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each one of us was stretched and pi@@ ped by us during the gathering of the waves . the elong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st of that , the Lig@@ o employees declared ins@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be precisely measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite handy , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by observing the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; in the case of sounds , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
your child &apos;s face for example .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the All literally speaking . &quot;
&quot; listening to Gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , whereby my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies are turning very quickly , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u ! &quot;
&quot; it is a type of motion of motion , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I listened to Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what he has to hear , recognizes this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens an entirely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can - practical or basically -- not to see .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ s@@ ous stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur however in the nucleus , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through since these op@@ aque are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate the iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own night@@ light . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s most important : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , as Lig@@ o observe them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we eman@@ ate from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks again .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; in front of which I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected manner . it began with a matter of my little ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; guess , I need milk for my be@@ ak asse . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I swear to always play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sag@@ a for playing with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am an author . I think things out , consider you to live . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am watching TV . I produce TV .
&quot; I do television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
every stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days by four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television &quot;
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my television series ran after each other on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I created myself , and not just produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who else does that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , a business or a school , take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I &apos;m not just typ@@ ing on the computer and fan@@ ta@@ si@@ ere , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that there is not a dream job in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m deep@@ ened into my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
&quot; it is like I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as if you have a high sound , running a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when work is running well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever . &quot;
many people assume that if I declare to them the sums that I &apos;m writing about writing that writing makes me happy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I started working and working and working , creating , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sums ! &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
sum@@ ming is action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you can not strive for size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know I &apos;m not doing for failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more my expectations are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sum , the sum , the sum . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sum stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burnt . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single working institution .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; guess , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are a baby @-@ tit@@ an .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the sum@@ ming did not come back .
my sums were broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium sl@@ um@@ ber doesn &apos;t give up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a flagship Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sum I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; Today , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you &apos;re working , one loves what you &apos;re doing , a ban@@ ker , a mother to be a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you a bu@@ zz when you already knew the sums , when the sums are stopped , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; south @-@ state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late and she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things are aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; valuation . &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone any more &quot; guess . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my hum@@ ming , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and mo@@ ist k@@ is@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; lets off . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me tri@@ ggers .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and not immediately , but it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums are coming back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; sum@@ ming up the sums , the sums of money , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using programmes and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
sum@@ ming is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum depends on love .
sum@@ ming is the flow that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; true hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sum is simple and original .
&quot; the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is a law , I have no choice . I have no choice , as long as I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not as easy as working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer working at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of man does he prefer to be at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I must have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we r@@ attle in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always have access to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever listen to the games ?
you can do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you probably have a right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think that they want something else to do . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit will replace me .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ y daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more don &apos;t need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can get up for 15 minutes , even on a bad day ! &quot;
15 minutes at the play !
&quot; no cell phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children get ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children .
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is doing well .
find out and store it yourself .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I wins . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to over@@ take myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with this ? nothing !
the sum@@ ming came back in my spare time . the sum@@ ming seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , travelling to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the country that I run , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sum , the sum , the other , the right sum : the sum of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more i ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am an author . I think things out , I &apos;ll raise you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; it is very frustr@@ ating for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; &quot; in this case , one im@@ pl@@ ent@@ ates an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered under intense trem@@ bling and severe pain .
but neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in emergency .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
&quot; they must imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain , and the cran@@ ial pressure increases in the skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in order to save lives , one has to reduce the pressure of the skull . &quot;
&quot; for this , you sometimes have to remove a part of a s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen tissue mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a tissue piece , is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to make them thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded . &quot;
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are very quickly sharing .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they remain ?
we don &apos;t know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so secure . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells . &quot;
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did
and then highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we appe@@ aled to them at the receiving table of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are energi@@ zing these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we spread the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
&quot; in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been emp@@ tied .
&quot; the proof that they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we trained monkey with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task . &quot;
they had to take p@@ ellets from one tray .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor vehicle motor in the motor Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they spontane@@ ously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of pl@@ asti@@ cal brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey who spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we spread the cells : the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that we were very exciting for us too .
&quot; since then , we have found out much more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream still is to implant them in humans .
I really hope I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you need about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look at the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ entr@@ e study . &quot;
&quot; first , you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as un@@ changeable sk@@ ill@@ ness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved no doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect austerity programs that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abol@@ ish it if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present an economic model for genuine democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save the democracy , but that we need a genuine and def@@ en@@ tive democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy , our societies are m@@ aturing , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the entire world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt burden , &quot;
but few recognise his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy raf@@ ters and corporations , who , however , are too anxious to invest it there where it would be productive and produce income that urgently needs humanity , for example &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars were invested in the US , England and the euro area , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail@@ ways , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 billion US dollars might sound much money until you compare it with $ 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which , as in an endless loop , promote the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , fear@@ ing , the prophecy of the rocket could be true that his son would kill him when he is grown up . &quot;
&quot; un@@ inten@@ tionally bring about the circumstances , leading to that O@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him . &quot;
that is my coat with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as majority control the government .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , aliens , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , giving them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal tuning into questions of the state of state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in ancient Athens . &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; for liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democr@@ ati@@ ated zone . &quot;
&quot; in our current democr@@ acies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , and the economy gradually under@@ went politics and has ma@@ stered it . &quot;
are you wondering why politicians are no longer like that before ?
it is not due to a de@@ generation of its DNA .
&quot; it is because it is possible to be in the government today , and yet not in power because power is immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which it feeds , has dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ved at the end . &quot;
&quot; the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , the economic demand falls , the general economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy back together and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as business and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the disappearance of weal@@ th@@ ier , and social conflicts more deeply , just as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to transform the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and take care that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united sector , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyp@@ e cr@@ acy that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved through a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines are used to serve people and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to indul@@ ge in the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it look like , how could it look to have this &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples soon . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and proceeds , and the concept of wage labour , are completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; there is no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong to . no longer between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no outstanding twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the sphere of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a freely sw@@ aying exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; the cosmos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment materials are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time the liber@@ t@@ arian , in whom it fav@@ ors privileged people , and Marxist , because it is buried in the history of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can present a genuine democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks again .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers said as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfectly . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not wir@@ y , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed in China now is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now accused of doing what the West has done in the nineteenth century , sm@@ elling m@@ igh@@ ti@@ ously after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew it was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency and continuous den@@ ial that a massive de@@ mis@@ ation of the euro zone proce@@ eded , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; right to make . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continued den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it will be possible to delay it for a while , but when changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who after 6 months in office , especially in a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the don@@ ors &apos; sides to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro area opposite comes from someone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone has not survived .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ sts will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of the people have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is an executive at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a cham@@ ois hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are right on this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the rating distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the website , IMDB , the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review . &quot;
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make addic@@ ted to where , after watching a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price is not worried about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average winding , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t enth@@ use them . &quot;
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon makes something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create achievements .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon &apos;s stuff comes out for nothing , do you pick up , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are watching when looking at these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or look again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data , in order to decide which show they should produce with these data . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and alpha House lands at 7.5 -- thus something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organising a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , i.e. the ratings they give to shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together they entered a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed firms . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic means that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so far , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone here know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will decide whether a person will be good or bad .
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
the best results are not always generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could be predic@@ ated by data analysis out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the worst type -- through data analysis of Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success was in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was another sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of sav@@ vy companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data flows back into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in case of legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as deciding for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the individual pieces ; as a second , put the pieces together to hold a resolution . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it all : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put pieces and pieces back together , even if the information is incomplete , then a good resolution , especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audiences , what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; this is what the data tells us .
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will publish it later with a technical demo .
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , and I should have heard in hind@@ sight on the ball . &quot;
&quot; however , as you naturally know when you have the data available , you want to replace them with a much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still paying off , making decisions is an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
