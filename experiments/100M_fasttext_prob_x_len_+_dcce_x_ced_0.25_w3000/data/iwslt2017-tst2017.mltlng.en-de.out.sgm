<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize in a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that NSA has illegally listened to phones by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation, in which the CIA literally surrendered designs for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not coincide at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been determined against Risen and called upon it to name its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became the symbol of the pattern of the government to condemn whistle-blowers and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive such information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they knew for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped on cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can still hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and tears for statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his phone number secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit return, and even travel tips with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA whistleblower and rift source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistle-blowers during his accession, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of having a whistle-bloom going to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software that didn't exist, as Risen had written his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this technology is SecureDrop, an open source communication system for whistle-blowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot store any information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardize all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technological separators like Edward Snowden have a possibility to use misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"or a Wall Street-Insider, who warns us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks again.</seg>
<seg id="42">[we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossaga Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a brief insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies like Mossaga Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of news as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of $2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of child days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous on the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems wept away from you, me, common people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that be?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, will be used to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it to me like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these buildings."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there were no prominent Americans so far, who came in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle of which these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have ties in the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some U.S. states there is less information needed to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off especially susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring some suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked us, that all of us went to a lawyer to our investigator, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leader in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to overcome this, we must change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this sort of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very trivial as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a safe optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen demonstrations of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political awareness by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress which we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy who are standing up and saying: "intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit themselves to ending this type of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally finish the intransparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stood and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Look, how please?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared to the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what did I burn myself? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, my toes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people, who were sold as strangers in childhood, were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"as I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham Omelette tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door to the castle fell, Brian and I started."</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discover that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"thus we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, people can then invite strangers to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to fire.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, one contemplates the things that one can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlock cell of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"so, who now has Al Gores mobile?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us that he is candized for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told him, whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to hand over your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their ratings before we placed them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are about age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three ratings, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if one has more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation provokes similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get out of it."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, such as" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you too much, such as:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Tolle art works in your apartment! I make holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to abandon those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly: a need, which had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">The business runs very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million communicated overnights had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, there can be wonderful results."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one right."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay is running."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this concept for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now just call" "rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is comparable to fast food. it is efficient and reliable but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visited, a group there would be waiting to fill one thoroughly and show one in a pub-tour quarter of which one has never heard of it;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn to cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">Are now offered residents. students who were looking for a residence</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed to people whose children had moved out, and incubator programs were launched."</seg>
<seg id="242">"to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also a hospitality beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find that amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">Every time I have to think about it when a red Mazda drives over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks again.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"studies show: Americans think, most would not know Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull-fitness-fanatikerin,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I decided to outen myself."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, which I as 17-year-old felt to suit a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought after, posed into question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>

<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking news. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such things?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists...,"... "in the name of Islam...,"... "Middle-origin...", ""... "jihad...", "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds turned me from others by a citizen to a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the US Midwest to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I was rolling around -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as Muslimin."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" Be careful, "" stay in well-lit areas, "" Don't slumber you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims congregate for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings came out:" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims, dragged and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got mad about the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love issues."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my community like a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour can only be seen under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks again!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Savior and Olympionias."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be some parking spaces free, but not stopping the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"regular visits to a mosque leads to a better look at people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalisation process one has noticed that it begins online. first, the person will be cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists group thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add ourselves to the world of imagination, if one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks again!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one throws a look at it, it does not exaggerate what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"everyone clergy with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that gave her mind to her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection with God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear we pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian regime, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if you submit a test person news, in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood against Muslims went upside -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can indeed be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when it comes to the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental faculty, talented, much promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the most sweetest, generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when has I become such a young man of my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after visiting Suzanne by her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, as well as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to visit the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child seat we went silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and drew off my shoes, and went into the building hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="433">Helicopters are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts coming together to hurt you.</seg>

<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my father-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, that was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and their observatories such as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a shell in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers often lead a really alberant dance in courses on the theory of relativity."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each one of us was stretched and piped by us during the gathering of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st of that, the Ligo employees declared insane."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be precisely measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of atomic nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite handy, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by observing the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in the case of sounds, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the All literally speaking."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to Gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, whereby my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"the two bodies are turning very quickly, one hears the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a type of motion of motion, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- I listened to Ligo: [Surrender noise] Someone who knows what he has to hear, recognizes this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens an entirely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can - practical or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massersous stars explode in super-novae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur however in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through since these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate the iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by its own nightlight."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and that's most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first run, which we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, as Ligo observe them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emanate from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes," "changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected manner. it began with a matter of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for inexplicable reasons"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"guess, I need milk for my beak asse."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I swear to always play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I am doing or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a startling side effect: only recently, I fully understood that the" yes "saga for playing with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am an author. I think things out, consider you to live."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream watching TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days by four shows, i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series ran after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I created myself, and not just produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classrooms, a business or a school, take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I'm not just typing on the computer and fantasiere, and it's true when I say: I understand that there is not a dream job in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm deepened into my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is like I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as if you have a high sound, running a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that if I declare to them the sums that I'm writing about writing that writing makes me happy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, this does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working and working and working, creating, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Summing is action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The summing is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you can not strive for size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know I'm not doing for failure, and I just know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more my expectations are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sum, the sum, the sum."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overstated, burnt."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working institution.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "guess, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby-titan.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sum ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The summing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums were broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium slumber doesn't give up, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a flagship Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "Today, stupid author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you're working, one loves what you're doing, a banker, a mother to be a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you a buzz when you already knew the sums, when the sums are stopped, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "south-state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late and she says:" mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things are aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me" valuation. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone any more "guess."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and my humming, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen "lets off."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me triggers.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and not immediately, but it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"summing up the sums, the sums of money, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using programmes and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">Summing is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">Summing is the flow that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sum is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"true humming ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is a law, I have no choice. I have no choice, as long as I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as easy as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what kind of man does he prefer to be at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rattle in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always have access to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever listen to the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you keep me naïve, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have a right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think that they want something else to do."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teeny daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more don't need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can get up for 15 minutes, even on a bad day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the play!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children get ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children.</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I wins. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to overtake myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with this? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The summing came back in my spare time. the summing seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it's me that I'm a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, travelling to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children are."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum. the country that I run, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the sum, the sum, the other, the right sum: the sum of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more i!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am an author. I think things out, I'll raise you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and to play more."</seg>
<seg id="793">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"it is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the most well-known, the" "deep brain stimulation." "in this case, one implentates an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under intense trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But neuromodulation does not mean neuro cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"they must imagine that the brain swells the brain, and the cranial pressure increases in the skull-brain trauma."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save lives, one has to reduce the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, you sometimes have to remove a part of a swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen tissue mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a tissue piece, is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to make them thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François succeeded."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are very quickly sharing.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they remain?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so secure."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which enables brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-speaking area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we appealed to them at the receiving table of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we are energizing these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we spread the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we spread the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplantiated exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been emptied.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the proof that they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dyed in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkey with a manual dexterity task."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor vehicle motor in the motor Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastical brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we spread the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were very exciting for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since then, we have found out much more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you need about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look at the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicentre study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable skillness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved no doubt that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is waning with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect austerity programs that have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would abolish it if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present an economic model for genuine democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save the democracy, but that we need a genuine and defentive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy, our societies are maturing, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the entire world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt burden,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy rafters and corporations, who, however, are too anxious to invest it there where it would be productive and produce income that urgently needs humanity, for example" "green" "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US, England and the euro area, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railways, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 billion US dollars might sound much money until you compare it with $5,1 trillion dollars, which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except to inflate the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which, as in an endless loop, promote the pessimism of investors, who, fearing, the prophecy of the rocket could be true that his son would kill him when he is grown up."</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally bring about the circumstances, leading to that Odipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my coat with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, aliens, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of athenic democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing in the Athenian democracy was and is that it involved the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, giving them the right to political co-determination with equal tuning into questions of the state of state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines brightly, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens."</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenical democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratiated zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our current democracies there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, and the economy gradually underwent politics and has mastered it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer like that before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it is possible to be in the government today, and yet not in power because power is immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about like a flock of carnivores, which so sustainably the animals, of which it feeds, has decimated that they are starved at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, the economic demand falls, the general economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy back together and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as business and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the disappearance of wealthier, and social conflicts more deeply, just as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to transform the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and take care that we democratize the reunited sector, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hype cracy that makes the film" Matrix "appear like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved through a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "in which machines are used to serve people and humans put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" Agora, "in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it look like, how could it look to have this" "Star Trek" "Utopia instead of the" "Matrix" "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples soon."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and proceeds, and the concept of wage labour, are completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"there is no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong to. no longer between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no outstanding twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the sphere of global political economy: imagine that our national currencies would have a freely swaying exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "the cosmos", "in units of" "cosmos" "-- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment materials are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is at the same time the libertarian, in whom it favors privileged people, and Marxist, because it is buried in the history of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can present a genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks again.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in the overall economic demand, which Larry Summers said as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am perfectly."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you're not wiry, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain way, if I may say this provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed in China now is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now accused of doing what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smelling mightiously after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew it was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to complacency and continuous denial that a massive demisation of the euro zone proceeded, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was, by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"right to make. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continued denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, it will be possible to delay it for a while, but when changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who after 6 months in office, especially in a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the donors' sides to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"it is worse than during the" "Great Depression". ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, said:" this was a colossal mistake. ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">"in spite of all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the euro area opposite comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone has not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the released centrists will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for being at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"most of the people have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is an executive at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a chamois hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as" films, TV, technique, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought branch."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the rating distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the website, IMDB, the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and above, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that make addicted to where, after watching a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price is not worried about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average winding, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't enthuse them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon makes something so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon's stuff comes out for nothing, do you pick up, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are watching when looking at these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data, in order to decide which show they should produce with these data."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and alpha House lands at 7.5 -- thus something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organising a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, i.e. the ratings they give to shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together they entered a car and decided not to make a Sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic means that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least what you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so far, this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will decide whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">The best results are not always generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could be predicated by data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the worst type -- through data analysis of Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success was in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was another sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of savvy companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data flows back into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in case of legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as deciding for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the individual pieces; as a second, put the pieces together to hold a resolution."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is to put pieces and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete, then a good resolution, especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audiences, what they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make it a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they were competing for TV ideas, then selecting" "Alpha House" "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "this is what the data tells us.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will publish it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life so far, and I should have heard in hindsight on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"however, as you naturally know when you have the data available, you want to replace them with a much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still paying off, making decisions is an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
