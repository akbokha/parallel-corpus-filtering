Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
&quot; an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today . &quot;
&quot; a cryp@@ t chapel , where now is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when maps are not up to date .
everybody knows this has to be exciting because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bayern of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and congregations in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; the large over@@ sight map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called prim@@ eval sheets . &quot;
&quot; these were based on data from the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Handel Stat@@ ute , between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon longed for an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical inclusion in Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops reti@@ re with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the present neighbors who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bayern @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische survey@@ ing management . &quot;
the flyer for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of former / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is the sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; Send@@ ling was born 21 years after the map was created , in 1877 , as a district in Munich . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian farmers &quot; uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the west park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming a small @-@ size map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written cor@@ rid@@ ors from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; primitive record &quot; &quot; from which the land was derived . &quot;
&quot; today , small plots do not prove to be farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 The site of the Oktober@@ fest , was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the territory of the today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or &quot; On the Air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , people once locked people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Münchner Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ ae@@ anstalt &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ nen &quot; was created there .
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who works for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 places were enlarged . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular rotor in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum in Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psych@@ i@@ atri@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
&quot; the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East is located west , east of residen@@ ces from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was built according to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ burg , which had been destroyed during WW@@ II by bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
the Allied bombs broke many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn station . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Mis@@ sour@@ i State , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents generally occur throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; says the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it difficult for people to win discrimination , as well as the State &apos;s prosecution authorities , which are di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights which happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are collap@@ sed or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points out a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , which shows that black drivers in the state will keep 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; Chapel said . &quot;
people must be prepared to bring it to Cau@@ tion or let relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI investigation programme of the FBI , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th position of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; earlier , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration laws , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing according to the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
the fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher wide fence project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag Members Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have gathered a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U town association met with the mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insight into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young k@@ itt@@ ens and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ou@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ eti there is exclusively regional .
&quot; as he is also known as BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s bach , he described the &quot; &quot; elem@@ ental &quot; &quot; project as &quot; &quot; fundamental importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably operate on such steep areas .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much needed to be processed with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader support . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
one hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
farmers face criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced by the electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the conservation area is therefore 40 hectares , which can not be for@@ ked up to at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs were subsi@@ dis@@ ed from the total cost of 71 500 euros , one quarter was borne by the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ men . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and vir@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Architecture ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state promotion of wil@@ low @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to hold the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of a conveying bal@@ m designated by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the area to be f@@ enced cannot be tow@@ ed ( slope rate over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the f@@ isher @-@ bacher mas@@ king project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the conservation area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump ré@@ g@@ ime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated controversy with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have lied to him if he had done it .
&quot; but he grab@@ bed its importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , sev@@ ent@@ een years after the completion of the memorial , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ ligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the stir@@ ring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your oppressed masses , who are longing to breathe freely , / the el@@ der@@ less waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; Wa@@ ste Wa@@ ste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller had not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Tr@@ umps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they did a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classical portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the big Schrei@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty was not one , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who brings the American flame into the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing . &quot;
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh was quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a matter of point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ usive but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and this is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump have ever wanted to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Great Britain team
&quot; the power director of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship k@@ ader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champ@@ ionships at the 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ dles , says it &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; is that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champ@@ ionships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain states that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms . &quot;
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking critics via Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t toler@@ ate the indi@@ ces of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers hit him for all , from home policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he ple@@ aded with criticism , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led as sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , therefore , compl@@ ained about it at the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if there is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Repub@@ lican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval by the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary ho@@ ver .
he has demonstrated a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - are unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , the spokes@@ person A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hate @-@ filled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other top@@ ical news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the govern@@ ors of the governor described as &quot; &quot; concentrated anti @-@ Spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to listen to a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same , that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ tori@@ als and to arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable porn had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers was multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous pamp@@ h@@ lets beat on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that supp@@ ressed Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament amb@@ ass@@ adors on behalf of the association founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
J@@ erry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels particularly &quot; , &quot; said the player to South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot;
to come back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on home soil . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; Or@@ r said , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m happy about the time it went .
&quot; the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ rance will be one of the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attribut@@ able to passive smoking annually , &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany . &quot;

house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ ingen Street are in full swing and &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as the underground is much more obsc@@ ured , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which continuously hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the firm St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and lock@@ outs is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ est@@ z and Tim Ko@@ est@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p are busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water from our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ est@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
&quot; if Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed with di@@ lig@@ ently , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water out of the nearby mar@@ sh . &quot;
a bucket in a hop@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was included in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or judges . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , while the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is deser@@ ted . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrug@@ ated roofs , which were transformed by r@@ ust in different yellow tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few of the Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua hon@@ ed a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of the people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ eri@@ ority and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was disman@@ tled in value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has assets worth $ 78 billion in excess of wood resources . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort depos@@ ited almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tort@@ ured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
&quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970s , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , were committed to commit genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ der Every@@ thing Mov@@ ing &quot; &quot; is called in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from 2016 where reports on atro@@ cities in the previous year are , such as illegal directions and torture - rape and power failures are particularly popular after another report , and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have strengthened because Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources are bringing an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic change is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local that moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it took the native Pap@@ ua , the mo@@ m @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - cost her market . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ovi@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals are dec@@ eived . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ wa@@ i in 2014 , with expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ov &apos;s initi@@ ation in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should shut up their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took a cl@@ ash in their tone and later returned to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children .
&quot; one child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly beaten up that he fell into coma . &quot;
&quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day . &quot;
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting arches and carried the orph@@ an dance - in a circle and im@@ itated a bird singing - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to strike stones on police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; it says in an official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , looked at the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the porch of his multic@@ ol@@ ored painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bullet came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was &quot; , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I k@@ issed him .
&quot; chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wounded . &quot;
the messages on the kill@@ ings occurred only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ az@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura had a passionate speech , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ ayed to tackle the historic ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will not happen again in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , Security Minister , said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5th in Jak@@ arta and said , he has no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , accused by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody struggle of independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m scar@@ ed , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , scar@@ ed of being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the fo@@ undry has not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
ag@@ itated vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , who responded by firing up warning shots . &quot;
but natives say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly delivered , so the TIME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile brig@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a cl@@ ash for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by encouraging spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potato .
&quot; they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire Airport . &quot;
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ th@@ ier migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions in the coverage of international media are ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deport@@ ed to Pap@@ ua because of lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permits were given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - launched the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right amb@@ ass@@ adors K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want Freedom , &quot; according to a source that also particip@@ ates at the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia announced another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ovi@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ovi@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ovi@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ovi@@ i as a &quot; &quot; debt &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims led to a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the bodies of an victim were buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with her head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second firing , which in only two years swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise , which one acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when people scre@@ am .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; a inhabit@@ ant told his name as George , Reuters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire , and cooled the building . &quot;
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from facing , the outer casing for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of sheets for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup @-@ reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has enjoyed his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal to play Davis Cup single was only supported by the two @-@ third majority for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain so preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was just missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to ensure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
I will continue to work on improving the job .
&quot; not only for the vote , the proposal had already come before the proposal to ex@@ ert the final at a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 , only compar@@ atively small details are : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next year in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training plans etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among passengers yiel@@ ded that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously forbidden items at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration have sm@@ ug@@ gled , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally carried forbidden knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they had been late discovered that they had mistakenly travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers tend to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the company said it had inter@@ viewed travellers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dental sm@@ ug@@ gling goods had brought through airport security , and how many had inten@@ tionally done it . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - bear the safety , those who fly the most frequently . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which fluids they may carry with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of objects conf@@ is@@ cated by T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought the T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k does no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ scored that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time revealed another , less brilliant figure for the first time in the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly report : the cancell@@ ations made on the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery has just begun . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k adm@@ its : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation agreement &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k cleared in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models should be taken together - 500,000 to be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to the mus@@ k , there are 1,@@ 800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production roads with no greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there are too much delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from being able to run away in crowds . &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s from the Obama Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presents the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state @-@ owned environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran for states on 1 October in order to comply with the O@@ zone standards for 2015 . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who , before his appointment as President Donald Tr@@ ump , was the At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , has long been a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay the regulation of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the post@@ age regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement released on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his down@@ turn in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under earlier administr@@ ations the EPA often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then to be charged by activ@@ ating groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority given to us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full @-@ powers &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re @-@ entry of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
&quot; the chief prosec@@ utor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the reverse of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York closed down California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight . &quot;
&quot; the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributes to thousands of premature deaths . &quot;
public health representatives and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for unexpected changes in the course of the course .
&quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to obtain this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to fight further against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government to turn to environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery @-@ site in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. , is invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their cause .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in the &quot; &quot; Würt@@ t@@ ember@@ g@@ ische Grund@@ kunden@@ buch &quot; &quot; : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the &quot; &quot; Vog@@ bey &quot; &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document according to the document , there was also a splendid courtyard on the hill beside the former parish church , to which the church or pat@@ ron@@ ate law belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , besides the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the local picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the splendid settlement nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps from around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ ism was originated from the early medieval right of y@@ uan .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built , erected a church and occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
this ent@@ ails the right to use a priest or propose a new pastor to the bishop .
three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater of the two were crum@@ bling on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during World War II in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were pushed and the bel@@ fry were stolen . &quot;
the roof was le@@ aky .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ my Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ar@@ us@@ kirche collap@@ sed .
only the steep@@ le was left .
&quot; in the New Year &apos;s Night of 18@@ 34 , a storm split the steep@@ le and half rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was dem@@ ol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower @-@ building still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em will be the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as organizers , the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade in the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ary Chapel . &quot;
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
architect Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the conclu@@ ding word .
the programme starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 p.m .
&quot; at the end of the seren@@ ade , there is a refresh@@ ment in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers pose a fantastic view . &quot;
Ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers hope for many supporters to obtain the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of significance for tum@@ ours and hear@@ ers . &quot;
friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to permit the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; hon@@ ors &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind force concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones shall prevent &quot; sec@@ rec@@ y &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; although the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , the district government of Düsseldorf was not approved , because of a form missing . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approved approval certificate is still illegal and therefore also decl@@ ining , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again decided the wind@@ break zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the respective letter has been received within the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her to the cause of re@@ viewing the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the reason@@ ing of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement is to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ wheel@@ er households . &quot;
the NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sens Stad@@ trat founded green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident

a woman was injured in a deadly accident .
two further persons were slightly injured .

city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region will discover shopping opportunities in the city center in September .
the business bever@@ ein and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract locals to shopping in the city center .
&quot; as the president of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket stuff . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , domestic firms are to present themselves with their training positions . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite the &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
&quot; with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry co@@ operates with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry . &quot;
&quot; thus , the business car and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest , together with sal@@ es@@ ed Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and wai@@ ver on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be re@@ opened again or again . &quot;
these include guests and tourists .
but also many natives would have lost the city centre while shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broad@@ ly made , had said to King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , Head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , informed that the country &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will take part in five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its importance for the common good of our cities &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .

tran@@ scri@@ ptions by phone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called for Tr@@ ump in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President attacked him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump launched his campaign campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scri@@ ptions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees emig@@ rated to Australia , was &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;

&quot; a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury was driven by a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ bled to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men came forward with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates ho@@ ver in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the silence tore the silence , when a young black man was torn apart from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene played on July 22 is just a night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them beat a very real si@@ gh in the audience . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists came back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were laugh@@ ed by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indic@@ ted for the kill@@ ings .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
&quot; for him , the provision serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that a injustice was never corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want redemption , but first we have to obtain justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
&quot; a medical exam@@ iner establishes a bed cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but nobody ever was indic@@ ted .
&quot; although susp@@ ects remain on the free foot@@ ing for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the pre @-@ election campaign in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the choice stab@@ bed according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore , did not stem from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when she came to the prison and came closer to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and covering the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an election @-@ right massacre , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , comprehensible and gro@@ unded in a kind of deep racism that many believe that he does not exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch , and to look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching , because we are confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the black crowded into a room and listened , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the high priest cri@@ es and supp@@ resses him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said n --- he , win@@ ch out of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona re@@ jects the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) burst into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gig@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black performers we@@ ather@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship sub@@ stitutes the dis@@ comfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely nobody laughs .
this re@@ petition ends ab@@ usive and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman dressed up with a wedding dress is over the body of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays , mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ an oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song end , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; kids ho@@ ck in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ching rope and wi@@ pe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona ch@@ ats two of his fellow players and then breaks up in their arms and the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did it for one reason . &quot;
later the audience will play together with the actors for dinner .
&quot; at a table , a white couple from Atlanta is chat@@ ting with a black couple who just got to know them . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance left behind .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues to continue , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks Hof goes to his table , he e@@ ats and reminds on civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ ordination is inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is focusing on a diverse and fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ st@@ ori@@ ed backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that there is an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine kill@@ ers pose as a rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; st@@ acked oil @-@ barrels recall Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhine kill@@ ers - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ess se@@ duce her Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , drag@@ ging a body in the trunk in Hollywood @-@ man@@ ier and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the splen@@ did@@ ly beautiful Hagen who surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe . &quot;
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated in a stor@@ my way . &quot;
&quot; there is a great appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in lifel@@ ong casual wear . &quot;
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to have an un@@ brid@@ led whi@@ stling sound in 2013 , five years later there were great che@@ ers in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his view . &quot;
I draw a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at the school already in the open day .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are 26 years now , so a late @-@ working volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I made a S@@ LC .
&quot; and then a building engineer , we say , successfully broke off . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point perhaps also , really is . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social sector . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you are doing your FS@@ J .
you can make it from home @-@ home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also in the O@@ GS , so in after@@ no@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; for me it was just the right thing , which irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could see and see my own strengths as it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people &apos;s head , each having a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son sp@@ ends more 3,000 jobs and cuts the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut off its divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome pressure with which the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts , the General Director John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 dig@@ its have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
con@@ voy attack from Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bomb attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghan capital , killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , informed Nato . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by Nato it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening , when a shared pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the violence highlights the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump weigh@@ ed down the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA V@@ oting Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le after Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , abol@@ ishing that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 , &quot; and said it is showing the obligation of the agency to cooperate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured , in order to adhere to stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year to October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , is to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature protection groups that are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce the lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants common space
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln decides to set up a community space in the future retirement residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing part of the land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will take a long time until the area of the congregation is now owned by the church community , there is no shortage of planning for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a community space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council flo@@ ats to fores@@ ee such a common space not as a meeting point for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean living , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ bar &quot; made the turn . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , so T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution sees to signal the investor that in this respect , one does not want to throw a gap between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is based on the environmental degradation - as well as pul@@ sed roof - which reduces the drop height and making the building more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the committee . &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of his own buildings with which one can &apos;t move so well , but now you lean back to the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing it hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is necessarily speaking for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
&quot; it looks like a hidden subsi@@ dy to any case , or even foreign investors . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no supplement , but I get a real , in case of doubt which is market@@ able , the counter @-@ speech is . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ w@@ ler &apos;s proposal to apply the proposed decision accordingly , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes so : &quot; if we summ@@ ari@@ ze the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with Auto : cycl@@ ist is hur@@ led on road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told us , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way towards Hil@@ den on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the train at the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
one in the same direction driving passenger car driver granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving onto the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic . &quot;
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .

Bayern Munich has to for@@ ego the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season . &quot;
seven pro@@ s lack the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , staff members are getting bigger at Po@@ kal@@ ns Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to wai@@ ve David Al@@ aba in Du@@ eling with the BV@@ B .
the Italian was confirmed on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the last six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti did the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expected a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans in their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , informed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the resin of star to star
&quot; in the Harz region , the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary track in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes to meet the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ kers . &quot;
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to set tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber &quot;
the information on the tables should be complemented by the internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network receipt plays a role in the selection of the site . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star path should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewers know much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; in which con@@ stellation , a selected star can be convey@@ ed and when it is best to be seen . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible with naked eye .
&quot; in the university city , since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ wer@@ g - the planet &apos;s planet since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path with its stel@@ es leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , whereas the sun is exactly 75 meters away and measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the total distance of the planet is four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to reach the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would last another half a year .
&quot; Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discussing a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing contest in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion who went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ Feder@@ alist Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion , Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former feather @-@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot;
&quot; I rose up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down on lightweight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans ask .
let us give them this . &quot;
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko will have to fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title campaign in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans were asked for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later pushed out to fight with the network that offers the best finance package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he likes Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a huge comb@@ at@@ ant , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ battle champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to turn the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show punch strength , then boxing . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Por@@ osh@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after a tyre de@@ fl@@ er
&quot; in case of an accident on the A7 , four people were severely injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 a.m. shortly before the exit point of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car turned to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it struck itself and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the wounded by the rescue service , the A7 was blocked in direction north for about an hour . afterwards , traffic could be passed on the left lane at the accident site . &quot;
&quot; sa@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zes the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result even if there were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two counter@@ parts too much , and we have to look even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense @-@ player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
and a gate after a free@@ wheel doesn &apos;t want to catch up any more .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in the preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know yet how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Wohl@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the three @-@ chain at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not make so many playing mistakes in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can speak after a draw from a mis@@ erable start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I leave the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Wohl@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Sax@@ onia in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday will enter the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stup@@ idity , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which must be hit from the start , &quot; says Fort@@ unas Legal coach . &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum seek@@ ers published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started carrying out tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Migration Act ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; to date , migration has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older whereas in more 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past few months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det searched for the 5@@ 81 results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , for X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were usually going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
ass@@ essing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said to the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is close to 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good in time , it &apos;s great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the Department of Road and Transport in the Pres@@ idency of the government . &quot;
&quot; in April , work began at the same time on all three bridges in need between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the end of the building is planned for October , and it is certain that the schedule is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , has received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side . &quot;
&quot; this is a border attachment , which is also used as an operating path . &quot;
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge is to be used on Friday .
after that the pedestrian path should be gone .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger tip has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected . &quot;
&quot; in the run @-@ up to the works , the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work . &quot;
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting wheat in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated in a single lane by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher place entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
&quot; the costs for the three bridge construction will amount to 700 000 euros . &quot;
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at Francon@@ ian Pot@@ ato Sal@@ ad
&quot; it is not so common that parties will pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is hard to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Krei@@ stag @-@ volcano ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that this day shows peac@@ efully , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ stein @-@ Stadthalle Ron@@ dell is inviting to the poster &quot; &quot; great election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land form the top duo for the parliamentary election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the amateur bands , but demonstrate . &quot;
&quot; the motto &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at one table &quot; &quot; on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the square - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the leading organizers , really rejo@@ iced : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and a lot of food , including a &quot; &quot; original potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence particularly at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcano @-@ sul@@ fur reports that he stri@@ ves for such an event and got the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was in demand at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there are not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with a view to the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the audi@@ torium is about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k hold their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can move back - no special events .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re @-@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli there are in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Kloster Church . &quot;
&quot; together with the trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in the brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
&quot; in this way , Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra . &quot;
&quot; both unite the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; like in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music , &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach performs together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ ogram , blend classical , jazz and free playing to a fascinating total artwork . &quot;
this core of the programme was first performed this spring with enormous success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I join in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague , Robert Patt@@ inson , who eventually dealt a bitter discussion . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette performer ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone I had . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never been confused or imp@@ aired .
I have never liked to be taken seriously .
especially among them she suffered under &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but at school time when she dressed herself like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , fri@@ ghtened and embarrass@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public do not like to educ@@ ate their love @-@ life : &quot; &quot; people expect you to sit in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself publicly . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will say to you as inhabitants of West Virginia . I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor .
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump said before a big announcement at West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice didn &apos;t endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and his father inherited a coal mine . &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening , saying : &quot; &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is only the last rejection of a party which is without leadership from top to bottom , and not able to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ u ( Ukrainian ) iso @-@ ir @-@ 111 ( Cyr@@ il@@ lic KO@@ I @-@ 8 ) mac@@ intosh ( Mac@@ Roman )
&quot; the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday which he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
Russian Athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Convention unanim@@ ously agreed to maintain the prohibition that was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored drugs in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e den Rep@@ or@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has seen in itself , that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for his re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete at the World Championships , which will begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the director of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a return . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
ob@@ itu@@ ary for the Sol@@ di@@ fied Sol@@ di@@ ers in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers were thought about by a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; for an un@@ clari@@ fied crash , Defence Minister Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she described the two inver@@ ted pilots , but as &quot; &quot; Crow@@ ns of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old sta@@ ats@@ man from Nord@@ hes@@ sen came to life a week ago in the west African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at mid@@ day , only the members of the Church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the German armed forces as well as politics . &quot;
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Director of the German Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the g@@ rief of sad@@ ness laid on ro@@ ses , and the relatives stood by arm in the arm of the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defense from Ley@@ en called the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers and s@@ atin down . &quot;
the Chief of Staff of the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the pilot operation of the Tiger @-@ helicopter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; without a doubt at the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Ley@@ en did not show : the use is dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is of great importance for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that divided the King &apos;s House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen was agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and it was further stated in the message . &quot;
&quot; where prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the thr@@ ill of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; Prin@@ c@@ esses . &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - nor after death , declared L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish royal family . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife &apos;s sympathy with the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik writes about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk cords instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of corporate critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with that position and not to be ashamed .
that was just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , however , does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he was talking about the resolution of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the surprising departure of a Green Members out of their country @-@ day fr@@ actions in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official appointment of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its cap to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen established her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
s &amp; D Group CEO Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend to his Group to include them .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament is elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; The red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could be ruled out without a majority in this situation . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable for the Land@@ tag to quickly adopt its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament re@@ jects the trust and elect a successor to the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these options need to be legally cleaned , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; all questions will be discussed in peace , if they are legally audi@@ bly checked . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ üm@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for dism@@ iss@@ al dep@@ u@@ ties to return to their parliament .
&quot; we naturally assume that she has returned to her country of land , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said the president of Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the group leader of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen exceptional . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to lead a foreign language . &quot;
&quot; also against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition from the Lower Saxony Green Members El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only tre@@ ach@@ ery to the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the S &amp; D Group on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the discharge T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politi@@ cian makes her personal interests in her ver@@ itable vanity and fru@@ stration before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty trick @-@ game and tries to beat political capital .
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ faction leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , presented T@@ westen before , with personal career @-@ giving the result of the country election 2013 to fal@@ si@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sy , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal have happened ?
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself against poison@@ ing eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and check the stamp print .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ char@@ ms . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we currently know is a health haz@@ ard virtually eliminated . &quot;
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the fact that Germany is concerned . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just as much concern the producers to ensure that the sold @-@ out products are market@@ able and harmless .
&quot; if passed with eggs of the back @-@ level content of 0.00@@ 4 / kg , they are not traffic @-@ capable . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current level of knowledge , the production companies do not meet any immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to expect economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practice of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in the crop . &quot;
is it missing only at the staff or on the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy could never be 100 % excluded . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where off@@ ences can be present are of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already seen several times that I expect a complete enlighten@@ ment by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to buy only safe and market@@ able food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ eled means that manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated without delay . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect all competent authorities , that the facts will be clari@@ fied quickly and completely . &quot;
how the F@@ oot Rules impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted issues of European soccer clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , because the executive organization that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was funded without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can safely make money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , following his election as a UEF@@ A president in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken huge debts in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ eive and risk to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch , originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential , and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 by the pres@@ idency , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to fri@@ ghten away from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will determine the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for billing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million will be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at the time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ act company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments from the World Cup 2018 Organ@@ izing Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar will become the World Cup ambassador and will simply be able to find out such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive , try to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they talked about the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and trim sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with respect to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of ownership and it has completely changed the overall landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the finance of Fair@@ play , because one can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss Life is looking for a new product supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss customers . &quot;
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed Sch@@ og@@ g@@ ite Panels per year distribute the flight attend@@ ants before landing to passengers per year .
Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; according to &quot; North West @-@ Switzerland , &quot; the volume of orders is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs . Mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a product manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants are involved in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aims to renew the contract for spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment . &quot;
Swiss chocolate panels have been distributed to Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ years @-@ Gr@@ unge period ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter passed the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ ehler and Paul Ru@@ dd to greater things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
&quot; but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
by sti@@ ff@@ ing on the core of the g@@ ags - middle aged actors play hor@@ ny children who are grown up - yet they managed to gain the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the heat .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more after the casting knew principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker @-@ Films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( The Hand that sh@@ akes the cra@@ dle ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character goes through an Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a novel@@ ist , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot included in the Ronald Reag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good read by Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt Dill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ie of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cr@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; these are the moments of acci@@ dental del@@ usion that may heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repe@@ ating &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : at the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ versus @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director , there &apos;s a bound TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ sung Gregor and an ide@@ alistic im@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are syn@@ ced in English . &quot;
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - creates the voice for a decent match . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Reag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; in six long episodes , the comedy is taking place , and the comedy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was dig@@ ni@@ fied on a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef once again visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ oured a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
m@@ ash against drugs Maf@@ ia in the country
the police took a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; Wednesday morning , the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart examined numerous objects such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , 15 defend@@ ants aged 25 and 77 years of age have been arrested and arrest warran@@ ts have been issued against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials ordered large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
in the same ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
the two are probably delivered to Germany .
in the campaign Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; the members of the m@@ af@@ ia are accused of organised crime crime , heavy violence , temp@@ ted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug trade in southern Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the grand@@ stand was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian citizens mainly returned to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account of the gang . &quot;
manner lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear there &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this lead to partly grave ab@@ sent@@ e@@ ei@@ sm in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the country register . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned way in an analysis presented by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the information , 10 million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data will therefore be administered by approximately 600 Aus@@ länder@@ behörde in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been adequately maintained , data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; of people who have long ceased to live , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the statistics of paid @-@ out people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; such false decre@@ es , however , led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with out @-@ of @-@ going payments , &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with less than 16 years of age when they are fed from there . &quot;
&quot; this goes out from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is said that &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country of entry . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the Office is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with reduced @-@ age children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) holds these commitments for sufficient .
&quot; other EU countries , too , would send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot;
&quot; the internal politi@@ cian of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten because of the defici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach already provided the blood donation service for other people .
&quot; at least , of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; all ahead of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community hon@@ ors multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood at the Municipal Council meeting . &quot;
&quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ously how our body is created for it and we give respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for foreigners , nor self @-@ serving , &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Operations Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the preserved foods are composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn makers reported from the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ reich@@ enbach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer of the DR@@ K district . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry belonged to the multiple @-@ giving and were awarded for 50 blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth is &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; when interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0,25 % , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % for 2018 , and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue to rise to just under 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; however , they sign@@ alled that in the next few years Zin@@ c @-@ mo@@ cks would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation rate heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that the credit costs would have to rise more than expected to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package , issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to neg@@ atively affect consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than the markets await . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound was based on these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the increasing expectations on a interest rate , and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover easily after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and low @-@ income levels , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing is getting worse first before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot prevent the in@@ comes of in@@ comes , but she added that the wages to the end of her three @-@ year forecast will be &quot; clear . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated for a part of lower consumption spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates on 0,25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pounds . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will be fully achieved by the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates has risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July called for an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and would like to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market particularly looks good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ iring and the new mort@@ g@@ ages will be closed , and many with due @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention therapy from September after a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre@@ ex@@ positions were taken before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the healthcare service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a verdict by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ex@@ positions pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection .
taking pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or just two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics will identify suitable participants who appro@@ ve the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a GP , can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is targeted and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts towards the prevention of HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer of NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when targeted towards vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
&quot; we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Secretary of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the commen@@ cement of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; it is now important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect persons infected with HIV , and to help them to step closer to the end of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I searched for something comparable to my price .
&quot; this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an intermediate floor to make the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 foot tall ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand . &quot;
fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the default .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were st@@ acked , without having to fill . &quot;
&quot; not only was it to build a simple platform , but to attach the steel so that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom . &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all the cut@@ lery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is reci@@ pro@@ cal , so it &apos;s very easy to slide the door . &quot;
&quot; thanks to clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will res@@ ell the base - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size .
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meter of some standard in something completely un@@ touch@@ able .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers struggling for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate @-@ imperial Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and their assets . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict about separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - written by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
the court states that this means that Col@@ in has property worth EUR 316 million and Paul amoun@@ ting to 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be an issue for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also struggle for the control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded it . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues , this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early monkey @-@ av@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans of the family . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says he started West co there when he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land from trial , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group , whereas Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , Paul says &quot; on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in kept very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire is the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media recorded contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case before the courts is .
&quot; it &apos;s very , very sad , that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict , &quot; he said , adding that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
new staff of staff is planning to restrict the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior staff at his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he wants to repair : bad news that comes into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .

&quot; when Can@@ didate Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i said at the time that &quot; the key to hold the Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady ex@@ alt@@ ation . &quot;
bye B@@ ye Su@@ i@@ Princess
&quot; but the idea that Twitter &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that tr@@ umps twe@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their intervention .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his employees manage to keep his anger away from him a few times , their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently avoided tr@@ ump controversy .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May , about the preference of the advis@@ ers to supply the president for strategic reasons without doubt . &quot;
this was an example written by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump as a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sted on finding out where these originate . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of the chic@@ anes , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
selected criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police throughout Europe sent in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are not known naturally , information from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action , which follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; -@@ Advent calendar from the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting on holiday destinations hide , called it from Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire &apos; series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on a war foot@@ ing , which have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn up by the community to claim a field in front of their aristocr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were kick@@ ed out only in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ging from the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence systems and expressed their cars through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved and are back now . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding a long instruction to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my com@@ ings , if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local people who did not want to be called said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps create an image of the situation in which the court must test , when we present our case . &quot;
Birk@@ enhof is owned by Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
the house in front of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the Birk@@ enhof hotel by the former Ambiente Company Ltd . April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time . &quot;
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interest in the house at that time .
he should be right .
&quot; with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels , with its registered office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof have been building waste containers since a longer period before the entrance , and when entering the house it becomes clear that extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old baths from the rooms are removed . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; pretty cosm@@ opol@@ itan &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer has expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , sh@@ ear@@ ers empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to raise itself wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot;
&quot; both individual holiday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
he already led conversations with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; the external systems are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible by the restaurant , which is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Represent@@ ative sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russian affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special speaker Robert Mu@@ eller is alleged to have deployed a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the committee recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
&quot; the station CN@@ N reported , there are already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a longer time to pur@@ pos@@ efully intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand who acted as advis@@ ors of the Repub@@ lican candidate in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special Represent@@ ative Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the centre and under@@ mining the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine the present evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions , and decide whether to be charged . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called &quot; &quot; charges &quot; . &quot; &quot;
mostly they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for hearing under oath .
&quot; according to the transmitter CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; apart from Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his team leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end , in order to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concerns of president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to port@@ ray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the theme is giving the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in a statement , he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work also usually in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot;
the White House endor@@ ses any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the Special Agency in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that not against the president .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the Declaration . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; following the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dism@@ iss .
&quot; unlike an independent representative of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air around the later rec@@ alled President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on the margins of the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; there are two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic sen@@ ators on Thursday , according to which the special agent could not be easily dism@@ issed . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ice mountain drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
&quot; in the West Ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg was solved by the scar@@ city of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ hammer . &quot;
this was divided into the Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a tril@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres big col@@ os@@ sus now travel to the north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest iron gi@@ ants who have registered researchers in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to people from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change plays a role in the breakdown of the ic@@ eberg , according to research data is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual cracks in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken @-@ off col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
&quot; thus , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C archipelago is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this archipelago was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions a few years ago .
&quot; a complete shot is broken down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts is in danger , as the front edge never with@@ drew as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be tr@@ acked if there is a piece of a key at a key point . &quot;
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and pushed ice so much water as it yields after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of damage leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers flowing directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could potentially increase sea level , but only in a small extent , the British research project is writing to observe the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts is the fourth largest archipelago of Ant@@ arc@@ tica after A@@ WI @-@ indications , with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and there is no direct connection to climate change , the iron sign now arrives in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the record began , &quot; he affir@@ med . &quot;
&quot; scientists have disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts will grow up again or go back in the long run and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development would take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not return the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , however , in recent decades many ice @-@ s@@ nu@@ ffs of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart . &quot;
this long tip of Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data of the research programme British Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline in temperature .
&quot; in the past 50 years , the Ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula has been war@@ med by around three degrees and thus reaches the areas in which the temperature is the quick@@ est . &quot;
CD@@ U wants domestic tari@@ ff for personnel
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U calls to leave the employer &apos;s association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration were added . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day behind them . &quot;
the apprenticeship places in the circle are obviously highly sought @-@ after .
some 620 applications were to be recorded for the places in vain this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle still lacks personnel to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann circle . &quot;
&quot; the search interface Pub@@ Psy@@ ch offers an easy to use search interface in English , &quot;
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wish of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application of the candidate . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include an education offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees who have disease @-@ related or age @-@ related causes are ex@@ cre@@ ted from the service . &quot;
&quot; the highest time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
&quot; he has long since made a la@@ zy surprise in the chal@@ k day , when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and start@@ led the other parties . &quot;
&quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow ex@@ iting from the communal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a domestic tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; says races . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials better than the public service actually fores@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available when switching to a higher stage oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the functions of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone for NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team had worked together effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself to detailed alleg@@ ations by the Italian prosec@@ utor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge any alleg@@ ations currently collected , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that its crew takes over din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which can be delivered directly by traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred apparently only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the case of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone of humanitarian grounds , and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer in charge of monitoring their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined dramatically over the past few weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine wil@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; Berlin Bran@@ ch &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and attractions . &quot;
there were three be@@ friend@@ ed guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , coupled with &quot; fu@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and return hu@@ ts brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed in the open air inhal@@ atorium healing Sole .
also Neustadt has been controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters in height , the group had met the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ aring up for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of cont@@ acting with wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high slo@@ gans included . &quot;
they have also recognized the first federal authorities who are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; there are still many clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the World Cup Football World Federation in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; apart from Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified . &quot;
Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people will also go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , it could be much more often present on these markets , than once a year to send the federal government to Asia . &quot;
what exactly is it about ?
&quot; in E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA made FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asian Games , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to the norm . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ atic also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses , which one also finds in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and respect the diet . &quot;
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but there are also problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming a topic more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports missing . &quot;
the scientist empha@@ sizes the high integrity of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are internationally on the road , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the company coun@@ seling Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predict rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; at about 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Consul@@ tants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe too , a lot is happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the World Cup clubs are now under obligation to set up an e @-@ sport department according to Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall away , and to clear the old times , is no longer enough . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
it is not possible to hold that only in football everything remains as it was always .

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy is forced to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were subjected to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced to Conrad Roy in June , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his call .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have revers@@ ed Conrad Roy , &quot; the prosec@@ utor said to the court . &quot;
she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; she did not take responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney At@@ tor@@ ney said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally regret .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I turn around with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry for eternity with us for his sisters to be there , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said that she &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to claim someone else to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a car in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hook up , spring from a building , stab yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks prior to his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy &apos;s death , and ordered that she should take advantage of any press from the event . &quot;
the case has shared the legal opinion .
Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was one of the few who defended Carter in 2007 because of murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a commentary in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ly : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua Kim@@ ba was allowed to run as captain during the Audi Cup , is not a coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern dar@@ es a great season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm there .
&quot; what was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua k@@ issed me immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to see , he made himself up to his arms . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as a Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the entrance could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach k@@ issed Kim@@ i as well .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a leader in the C @-@ elf out of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of holidays , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar is distributed to those , which one likes to eat much , which you want to keep in good spirits . &quot;
&quot; so whoever has been chosen to take the legacy of L@@ ame , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old served as a mini @-@ paraly@@ tic about the field . &quot;
&quot; right rear , this is now its position , the white tie in the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ i worked in this starting formation as the one who can best take the helm in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to steer the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal thus , to over@@ play his lack of fitness ( folding hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches to make out on dev@@ ils come out of the services of the Asia trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le were not neg@@ atively charged in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this worked quite well .
&quot; sweet was running beside k@@ im@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both ag@@ itated sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was very difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried to get successful in the game building a few times . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy adm@@ its that the result was &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance when the debut was made .
&quot; shift , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also caught . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new additions , one looked at the game afterwards . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ ben there were not one or two , but six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; with Bavaria , you simply need to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one any more . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ dom grab@@ s the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the main revers@@ al sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gaps between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stand at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 is expected to be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank Trier , who is in the urgent need of the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says ministry spokes@@ person Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; of course , nat@@ us sees a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) is aiming at the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; in the new champion Bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a prize of € 1,000 is envis@@ aged for the constitu@@ ent master exam and 2500 euro , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years of master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is fast facts to create , but at the same time it is out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive director of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to set up mobility in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot;
the I@@ HK is calling for more jobs to external offices .
&quot; comm@@ enting on calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , CD@@ U &apos;s vice @-@ president Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , investing more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country , as it wants to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supplies in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ dy Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
&quot; the Gre@@ ens left Lem@@ ke in April to become a president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already cleared the field after four months because of discre@@ pan@@ cies . &quot;
Audi is to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said that the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than travel restrictions , &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a call@@ back .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support observ@@ ance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however , nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are regarded as carcin@@ ogens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for autom@@ akers to install machinery for neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases , which are exposed to diesel vehicles , also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of den@@ ying the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called anti @-@ switching equipment that could regulate emissions to comply with the rules when a car was tested , but return to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indic@@ ted by Volkswagen and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former manager of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to deal with the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer carries over di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ately to the profit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; so that also the Is@@ ar visitors participate , a raft through Munich is driving a raft on tomorrow , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if it goes back to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Reich@@ enb@@ ach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a normal raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building reference wants to clarify .
&quot; on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent . &quot;
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; True love &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to be shar@@ pen@@ ed as a protective game of wild . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ases and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the best @-@ published carto@@ on@@ ists , the kin@@ ases of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ er still records and works on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as a dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the six@@ ties , the breakthrough happened : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own information , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches still find its dro@@ ll figures worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thou@@ sand@@ fan as a counter @-@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film that will come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script will not be written by him .
&quot; this is why he rather uses the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is produced word@@ lessly . &quot;
lav@@ ender threatened by climate change from Provence
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught and due to illness , the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered as the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall . &quot;
this has effects on the lifetime of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small c@@ ic@@ adas , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have less portions with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered to be a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

assass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce are normally meeting on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break @-@ break from violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ed up throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is their editor and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , &quot; Val@@ dez has written in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 a Special At@@ tor@@ ney General was established to deal with the cases of journalists , it only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with the thousands of kill@@ ings linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put to trial . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not comfor@@ ting , even though the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little value , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the why , we mis@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez finally left the office of the newspaper &quot; &quot; Ri@@ odo@@ ce &quot; &quot; in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
&quot; but for Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are struggling to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &apos; rest &apos; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , has broken the blame for he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the riv@@ alling anti@@ trust authorities in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gangs bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was Val@@ dez had not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security , following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce with five colleagues and sold 50 USD hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug of drugs , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courage@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters loved performing harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs , wherever they lead . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead men ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ sia team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the sp@@ awn @-@ bird , who was able to cur@@ tail such a port @-@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; Is his love for a routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death , too , forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and to stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no cell phones allowed . days before , it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some repor@@ ters questioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers , who were not trust@@ worthy of the Gover@@ nor himself . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters went into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has li@@ cked on three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of brother &apos;s brother Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending , concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a repor@@ ter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all the political levels . &quot;
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this e@@ at@@ ery , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers had seen Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slim body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another repor@@ ter to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by writing in organized protests &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings .
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to gain international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and killed them , because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ ordin@@ ate society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that Rep@@ or@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , who put the organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media watch@@ dog group &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phones were lying next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the El Nor@@ te newspaper in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is difficult to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are ch@@ ased as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , adm@@ its that drug trade scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to sum up . &quot;
a number of found@@ ries with riv@@ ets and security forces near the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
&quot; the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region . &quot;
&quot; from the on @-@ board cann@@ on , they published the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren l@@ ul@@ ten nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , keeping watch to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when on the same day that J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send her to the streets . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ ak to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening . &quot;
now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable N@@ ash@@ orn of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his fl@@ aky skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the dead@@ ened din@@ osau@@ r , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has blo@@ ated researchers , which describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re only blin@@ king a little , you could almost believe it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ riere .
&quot; researchers found out that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , even though it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter sh@@ ading which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed us to get better into his surroundings and to ev@@ ade his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ en@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ ter@@ ment is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the most living animals survi@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been the Cre@@ tac@@ eous Period , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to study the animal on hints of his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ gen , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and tos@@ sed into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ ator is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative sk@@ ate skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as same today as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you just look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous Period was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , stood on two legs , perme@@ ated the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster . &quot;
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sunk after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the survi@@ ving ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops rag@@ ing from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed by the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the sub@@ marine life of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ g@@ ust still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured s@@ labs along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it gets . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot lies at his side , his five fingers are stretched upward . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
in thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , miles long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , approximately 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , there were nearly 30 vehicles between the junction stations of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , including trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , no information is available about the exact number of publishers . &quot;
&quot; it was a light to moderate injury , said a spokes@@ person for police . &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of direction Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re long way back was formed . &quot;
&quot; like a AZ repor@@ ter , it also came on the counter @-@ track to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade noted the number plates of the vehicle operators who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident happened at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ f .
&quot; the conductor comes and ar@@ ouses one , or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot;
driver &apos;s control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the full @-@ time ticket control .
&quot; it is simply confirmed by a mobile phone , that one has taken its place and thus vali@@ dates the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test run operates on two routes . &quot;
&quot; when the offer comes , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will be available at many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train card de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; in order to be able to use this , some conditions have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to have purchased it via the app of the rail , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : you step into the train , call your ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
the test customer then appears a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train attend@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
&quot; if the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection at PLA@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can go to sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel safely without ticket control by our train attend@@ ant , check out the DB Navigator itself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often travels , knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , the travel card controls belong to the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , however one of the fellow travelers not all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or your ID card is missing , or any other document that you have to show . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train attend@@ ants and passenger , leading to a bad mood in the section or greater room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat that she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
&quot; he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours . &quot;
&quot; this is wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell was thinking . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying out , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman ass@@ aul@@ ted his rif@@ le and scre@@ amed : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
&quot; at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills . &quot;
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she picked up her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation , which they had &quot; over the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember , how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her with her , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the happiness to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience a lat@@ ent racism , she is no different from the next black female child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service , to keep her away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected to a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to assume for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism completely changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell arrived during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an has already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around death @-@ insect in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rell near@@ er to the project , together with six other locals , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; was followed in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s execution . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be presented , for so I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community coming together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ um &apos;s life as she falls in love and married her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; moreover , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Matter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Matter &quot; &quot; in social media after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; Fer@@ rell said , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of all . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; at which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , even though she was at the forefront because in a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news media in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping center on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the theme hardly leaves one . &quot;
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery says , &quot; That &apos;s a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s real great &quot; ( Nicole Sch@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , from which the remaining shops will benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone ble@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer &apos;s market stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction work , it will end . &quot;
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady always very happy . &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after building the gallery a chance exists to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market market@@ ers res@@ ide in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; however , the new project should not be very low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; it is a shame that specialty shops are almost no longer , and what remains of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not suit me .
and the gallery does not fit in to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; above all , where should the farmer &apos;s market hall be located during the construction period ? &quot;
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery really comes at some point . &quot;
or does the spec@@ st bit gallery have been able to sell all shops in Bit@@ burg before ?
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; that will simply not work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ lem who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after being classified as a secret diplom@@ at about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( a suitable res@@ emb@@ lance ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has combined its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident , whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA derived from Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual comment , not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison had supp@@ ressed her image , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond wig - associated with it . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ eland was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ t and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazin .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ eland with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; she couldn &apos;t visit her at that time and she could not be photograp@@ hed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use have become un@@ equal bri@@ des@@ people who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created a cartoon by &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president of the Over@@ seas Jud@@ gment would transform and it would be able to personally see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , only a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and heavy , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually solve . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is equipped with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ meter of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides in accordance with the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome is not responsible for who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ inal Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above comic amend@@ ment mentioned above . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing as she emerges from the disciplinary bar@@ racks of the United States such as King Kong with a free spre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on .
&quot; if they disgu@@ ise your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition in person - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed by the masks of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ eres , which gather as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ eland from portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University due to murder sought
&quot; a country@@ wide human hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injury . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued an arrest warrant for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; a community warning system published by the Chicago police authority , states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ thema is an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ thema is now in leave and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University collabor@@ ates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demanding the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 , too . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that were them and War@@ ren in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background , resear@@ ching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian deputy Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ implementation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported findings of the dop@@ ing approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was exp@@ elled from the WA@@ DA for dop@@ ing control in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be re @-@ deployed . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Association Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed . &quot;
she called out people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , to provide employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and directly turn to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most dis@@ comfort and which executives have low cons@@ enting results - so that you can drill , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 according to the finance @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber Fall in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; attracting almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
date : 06 / 13 / 2009 Size :
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent enables companies to send customised &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; surveys to gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the chief executive board is involved , complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees poor@@ ly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email to the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company inv@@ oked converting , problems that were previously seated by managers who sat in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair train@@ - faster identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; Vit@@ rano said , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies knew they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will take the consent of Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; attracting $ 10 million in financing in February of firms such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , attracting the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing the total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are more likely to expect from their work@@ places than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only missions . &quot;
staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that makes their voices heard and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Conver@@ t and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks staff to your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough or not at all , this dis@@ appointment can breed and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about 4,000 comments , you have to be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , staff ask themselves , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ di@@ son Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to launch action on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so deliver@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in a long term this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is well @-@ known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; Vit@@ rano said . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it goes to 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled off their tri@@ cot surfaces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are registered to the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brothers moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood performed practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supported the change of control of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if she adds another point to the busy itiner@@ aries of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed through , they plac@@ ate on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end up its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is due to the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective grid behind a door post , which will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; brother players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people would rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking place 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors of third parties and show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and to send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also affected the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany will support a plan that social media networks should be punished if they do not succeed in eliminating hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fact inspec@@ tors are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to be testing its feature on the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to decrease false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the protected River Valley in K@@ ent and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb @-@ print on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell like smoke , because at that time one lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and spent almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this all seems too nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that have spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape donations , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , put it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps depic@@ ting who what had : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; &quot; Emp@@ ty Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ uit pat@@ rons that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell presented from the 18th century , who stages his own burial by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed quite a cro@@ ok to always make debts and spend money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men rede@@ emed their debt crises by getting married old women - I imagine it as a pile of good looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences &quot;
&quot; he had a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like , &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ chapel envel@@ op@@ ed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Lady Chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef was launched on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Art@@ z intend to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th as the highlight of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we do not really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; they write on their website which is un@@ folded yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
&quot; and to make it clear , that some things are better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are convinced that as Bad Honne@@ fer , we know very well the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; after all , she stands in competition with other local authorities . &quot;
the town of Bad Honnef lets the town of Bad Honnef also cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts in Ankara on retirement plans and promotions . &quot;
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine among the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of State , the five Vice @-@ Democrats , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs , took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in excess . &quot;
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; true Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dism@@ issed . &quot;
&quot; since the coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees the Erdo@@ gan as a wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 486 people who have been involved directly in the attempted assass@@ ination attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara for this week . &quot;
&quot; even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan den@@ ounced the attempt to overthrow the &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Dis@@ comfort at the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the large @-@ scale rein@@ forcement of the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan ordered another 73@@ 95 coup leaders by decree , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the real masters of the country .
&quot; three times , she appe@@ aled to her role as a guar@@ dian of the secular state . &quot;
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan urged the power of the military to step back by step , not least by calling on reforms of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is driving forward a milit@@ arization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an especially not so @-@ called officer who sought asylum after the attempted coup attempt abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the alliance after pur@@ ges , there is no doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he plans to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in both chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries will be dealt with green cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the Can@@ did@@ ates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race drivers
&quot; again and again over the past few months , the future of the Clim@@ ber @-@ Clim@@ b has been cont@@ ested - now it is going to be very fast . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , the tourist train is scheduled to be built at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of the circuit , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start on the track this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and modernis@@ e the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection for tourism , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of the maintenance of the track was about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country exceeds 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country also in the future , will be finally voted , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ ing@@ ia railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; thus the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in recent months , a pilot operation has been tested whether the route has been used by enough people to re @-@ order them again in the future . &quot;
the track is also heavily b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried about
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ul@@ ators have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye colour over the shape of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes more distur@@ bing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would look a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ul@@ ators have developed to robots with a silicon skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; she can be tired of being fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female features , the all@@ usions to rape when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy beha@@ ved with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not consider any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is sick@@ ened out of the border zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until they give permission to the free market . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has pre@@ tended to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most det@@ err@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away .
&quot; they have no intermedi@@ ation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleas@@ urable slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : maid
&quot; pumps , hose reels and accessories &quot;
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
&quot; it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that political divisions , which pol@@ arized US voters , also have split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all supposed to make our dust bub@@ bles burst .
less noticed is the power of m@@ umps to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ left poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone knows , including the repub@@ lican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it is in another context that this also ent@@ ails significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the horri@@ fying effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the big possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer meet us . &quot;
&quot; there is however an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans norm@@ alized &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appears to be the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays about an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ it@@ ant version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to one as very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as un@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my c@@ ousin in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the biggest of the New York car &apos;s car@@ ousel , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twi@@ sted to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music convey@@ s this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ ics Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park car@@ ousel , however , is still a strange magical experience as two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women can walk on it in the 40 @-@ s and have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to rate the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , during this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to submit to her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar G@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ or@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist , according to the prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; because of murder , Pist@@ or@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of toil@@ et@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ or@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly in@@ tru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal to the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ or@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosec@@ ution said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection can be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ or@@ us is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ class vessels of f@@ use and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to college , four at the secondary school . &quot;
school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
&quot; as a symbol of school dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes elected a young eagle in the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Lower Sch@@ ar took a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a h@@ ens of chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him fell apart , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed a chicken dance in three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder bore to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said Schul@@ leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every tet@@ rac@@ ist that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; there followed thanks @-@ word to the colleagues , the former head of school Michael Müller , who always jumps in the classroom and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; now the ken@@ nel time is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of lessons , they only leave lessons very ung@@ u@@ ously , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ tone wat@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer and summer time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out with the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ tim@@ ers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , distributing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal camp people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have shar@@ pen@@ ed control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel @-@ drivers have to participate in the campaign ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emission behaviour of cars from the emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe are estimates of :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have Schumacher software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit ordered the Bundes@@ amt ( Bundes@@ amt ) Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced a rapid implementation in the next few months , but not yet known as an exact date . &quot;
Daimler announced to write to each affected person .
&quot; if an inspection is already due , it will be handled within the framework . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions go altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; means S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment . &quot;
how long should the update last ?

ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rap@@ pers to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution on Thursday announced , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) were among the honored . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania on the award . &quot;
the prize @-@ winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced to abst@@ ain from taking part in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and it bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify her view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy Center , named after President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; former lau@@ re@@ ates include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city life worthy
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the coming year . &quot;
the place is already written - but suitable applicants are rare .
since 31 years W@@ acker is a city builder .
&quot; and the work still makes him great fun , as he convey@@ s in the press conference . &quot;
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it surprised him that so far no application has been fulfilled . &quot;
the city is searching for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; with the exception of the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a famili@@ arization . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub@@ contractor , the applicant has to show appropriate conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but clos@@ eness to citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as good spirits between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the town worth life , &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz have been initiated . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still subject matter . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike at about 1.5 million euros , &quot; If we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; for an urban master , there is a lot of play space available . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own yard and gar@@ dener , much can be re@@ acted in many ways . &quot;
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often cited by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble under monument protection stands , it is important to &quot; &quot; have an eye for that which fits &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city builder empha@@ sizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries a great deal of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot;
&quot; in support and coordination , he can count on long @-@ standing employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the spot . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to be buried with Roland W@@ acker , after information of the city of Has@@ lach , you should be able to present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or with technical architecture and have good skills in the areas of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) under@@ goes civil engineering , civil construction planning , basic job opportunities , administration of urban properties , municipal utilities with building yard and city g@@ är@@ t@@ ner@@ ei as well as underground construction authority , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines thrown : South @-@ rail route closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike of the railway track transfer in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were badly damaged by the fact that the anticipated freight had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and look for them since the night .
near the scene there were witnesses of a sco@@ oter and a bike rider .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ yer realm , &quot; said Ö@@ BB Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves to a great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of rail transport , the railway subscri@@ bers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; all in all , to go out of a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten people had dropped off Friday afternoon , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall off , but they had a delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while suffer@@ ers are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food are not penet@@ rating into the body . &quot;
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue .
&quot; when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins to destroy the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; it proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet toler@@ ant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ate a toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el chor@@ us , when the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an investigated a kind of immune cell that fav@@ ored tolerance when she found out that a group of mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , this did not have . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six species of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were missing an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were obtained by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria exer@@ ted on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when the active component was cle@@ ans@@ ed out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in people like mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control infections on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature from Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last Pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira moved to will . &quot;
but M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho claimed he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent reported this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho insi@@ sted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four priority obligations . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner via the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising before .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new drau@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel is still an SPD leader , social @-@ democratic Prime Ministers always looked at Berlin with a certain concern for Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no fires of fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the federal government - was the most important wish of the elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with head@@ wind in the approach .
there were failures .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Con@@ federation @-@ CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ Green can simply not reliably rule , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
s &amp; D Group &apos;s news on the European Parliament &apos;s Plen@@ ary session in Strasbourg - 18 to 21 May 2015
&quot; five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition , with that , lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner asked the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen immediately has to reti@@ re to her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Bureau of Business and Elec@@ tors of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; he si@@ ghs an SPD @-@ Elec@@ tor , when the new Job &apos;s Message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority after the transition from the green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen there . &quot;
it is the temporary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD countries .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery begins with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med himself at his time . &quot;
&quot; after the federal elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then also - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the tum@@ bles , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly . &quot;
comrades in the weeks after that the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously stir@@ red up again .
&quot; then , when they had just plu@@ cked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg was coming . &quot;
and with him came the next deep r@@ ash .
&quot; mayor Olaf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot;
and because in crisis communication he did pretty wrong with what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fought for his political survival . &quot;
and now Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust f@@ ume and its role in the supervisory board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been critic@@ ised for a long time . &quot;
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l has always tried to acc@@ entu@@ ate acc@@ ents in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the endeav@@ our of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden by Martin Schulz &apos;s environment . &quot;
they let him grant him as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in essence no fault . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is aimed at the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the slo@@ ping parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ westen there . &quot;
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen put its own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; not because of its person as a direct candidate , Mrs. T@@ westen combined with the Landes@@ liste of the Lower Saxony Green Party , Ms T@@ westen combined with the lower Saxony dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of a &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &quot; welcome four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD to the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election outcome , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments by the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding fees for local core III
&quot; who wants to rehabil@@ itate in the years old house , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EG urban development held on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been involved in sensi@@ ti@@ zing areas of rehabilitation .
&quot; at that time , in the restructuring area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the area of restructuring II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was at least 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to also promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe will receive the information that there will be a restructuring area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros are from the country , the rest from the community . &quot;
how is a restructuring area formed ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; real old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned field . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area borders could also be postpon@@ ed again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , the ST@@ EG represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Stadt &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per property , carried out . &quot;
the restructuring area would finally be established as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for funding runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the stock intake would only be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area to fill out a questionn@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , as soon as possible , the pro@@ posi@@ tional complaint should be carried out in order to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann concluded that each commun@@ e must perform the said preliminary investigations .
&quot; it is about evaluating the conditions of urban@@ ism , and decide when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot;
there will also be a re@@ clamation mark in the land register for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make himself a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success factor for the project is the involvement of the participants . &quot;
&quot; this is why there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; in which it deals with the structural condition and refurb@@ ishment views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; household and home sheet &quot; , &quot; information on size , partition and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out if premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , to be noted , Got@@ zel noted that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; moreover , re@@ building measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of the funds after the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , grin@@ ds first . &quot;
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a renovation &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a Consul@@ tant An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant method is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the cost of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
&quot; the decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars according to the military &apos;s data left to TIME Magazine . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American Construction Programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued alongside a ship from Ma@@ ine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event of high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Navy commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter crashed on the South La@@ wn on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was vac@@ ated this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required for return flight due to the limitation of the service hours . &quot;
&quot; during the event , the original flight crew was at the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time . &quot;
the recordings provided by TIME did not indicate whether a second flight crew was finally required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the provision .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; the Deputy Command@@ ant answered . &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform the health reform that was in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the airplane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; in February Tr@@ ump launched an investigation when the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services provided , and his Twitter account is full of messages that describe the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX 1 crew often perform training flights in the Washington area and the South La@@ wn to en@@ force US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings at the White House in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted on the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said one official . &quot;
&quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ pres@@ idency support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Sik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in setting up helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget desig@@ nations for the presidential pl@@ ou@@ ghs , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget , the Do@@ D refund rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for refund rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the State Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helicopter inter@@ acted when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter car . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky spoke with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
the top riders of the second tennis tournament will join the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; despite all five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the second tennis tournament has gotten the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , always playing in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; on the back positions I find the team very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV it is mainly the imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup .
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult for us as always . &quot;
&quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; while the competition in Italy &apos;s Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man is not the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec . &quot;
&quot; the hitherto un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo , yesterday with the White @-@ rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski , was still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball . &quot;
&quot; it should be in Kiel but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus could again move into the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , does not fill anybody out of the training centre around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der . &quot;
how America can harm the OM@@ V
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not act when he sat on Wednesday evening his signature under the law for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his H@@ ast to en@@ act the law , &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against US advance . &quot;
&quot; after all , the plan is to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors have been disturbed by the domestic OM@@ V , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Group North Stream 2 together with other European companies . &quot;
the dr@@ ones are huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
the press &quot; has looked at which the Group could aver@@ t and which could really hurt him .
Nar@@ cos relay 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the Hit@@ series by Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer exposed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from above . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vill@@ ains of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) makes the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York . &quot;

role revers@@ al : the city provides 46 ch@@ icks
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lun@@ ch@@ time itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city centre of kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; bo@@ iled in addition to the house , a cat@@ erer is responsible for this task and delivers freshly cooked ch@@ illed . &quot;
&quot; the city runs 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who take care of 45 week hours are in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service from September 1st : they heat the incoming food , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal out , rin@@ se , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sev@@ eng@@ ed units - decides about the hour of the hour .
&quot; the kitchen staff now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; they are much more involved , and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the ch@@ ick force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known strength in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the ch@@ ick forces - is in the future settled by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical solution for the city as the most economical solution for the city . &quot;
&quot; and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong in weight at around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
three women candidate for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban has published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ des with the transition of international martial arts to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women in all registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to con@@ strain itself with Mc@@ Vi@@ tie at managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work at work , which alongside other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties Ow@@ ner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s &quot; &quot; concerns &quot; &quot; that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we are not able to gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Glasgow Greater Region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed for a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the T@@ oll@@ cross branch has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to it , as we value continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly check our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than £ 5 million in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
La Liga page may rep@@ ent its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in its pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not ref@@ rain after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to release its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the World Record case ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the previous season . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way out outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for every club , who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to make one of our players sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club express interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has deliberately cast a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Straße in front of the estate number 30 , and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle property damage of more than 200 Euro . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , Phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for cl@@ ues . &quot;
&quot; for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police seek witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because a car met him on his track , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and touched the guide . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction Le@@ ese on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the town centre of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to devi@@ ate to the right . &quot;
the Tour@@ an driver touched the guide board .
&quot; in the passenger car , property damage arose . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the incoming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his drive without taking care of traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident , it can be good that the driver didn &apos;t notice the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police are now asking for witnesses to the incident , as well as the driver of the cause of the cause , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au at Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report reli@@ eved Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the ab@@ uses is reli@@ eved of Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ es , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication in front of the German press agency , he was expecting from former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chapel Master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would be very useful to the Catholic Church &apos;s reputation , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand critici@@ zed that in reporting about violence in the domain cats with &quot; two measurements &quot; was measured . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; which would be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and that is a dev@@ oured Fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; to cope with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports of the abuse of abuse , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger , writes ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which the Law@@ yer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg ? &quot;
&quot; altogether 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of assault , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
especially with high levels of emotion@@ ality the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe .
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims were estimated to appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories of him . &quot;
in the interview Ez@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; incidents of violence against victims of protection at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; shows a contradic@@ tory picture of the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students are raising his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became hand@@ some of the gre@@ ener , when a cathedral sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
he has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school occurred outside its sphere of influence .
&quot; it is best to repro@@ ach him , experience it too late or have not taken the first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um on which it worked was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , a very excellent witness , describes it as &quot; warm @-@ heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always moved from grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to ou@@ tru@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; he did not only kno@@ ck on the floor with chairs and cast the key@@ chain on the floor , but also distributed ear cow@@ ards and enjoyed too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he regre@@ ts himself years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question of time , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced it in a world@@ ly school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it actually is about this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the ex@@ tradition of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly dig@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of whether it &apos;s not a matter of famili@@ arity with him and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many of the media have just rus@@ hed to him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many people who never understood Him still work ze@@ al@@ ously . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot of abuse has been reported on the issue of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity in regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of those affected by the other , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
the true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us leader , who had professionally been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ disciples R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the ab@@ uses ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have prevented the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , to assume that they have settled ... boy im@@ penet@@ r@@ able , or more clearly or more , than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; that the student and / or the environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of not being able to prevent or adver@@ tise him . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as happened in some cases . &quot;
in the media a lot of &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; were to be read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; dispos@@ ing &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything mixes and mixes everything into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is precisely what is the abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents of the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly chann@@ eled and portra@@ yed , and among them horri@@ fied , happened at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have occurred . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got to face the boys when they were already on the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as most witnesses stress , the subject &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; you were only happy to be able to escape , and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions . &quot;
what was different at the secondary school gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; &quot; many victims would appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report was only able to define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again in 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently dev@@ oured the ears from the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um , who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the investig@@ ative punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended an urgent move . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pun@@ ishments have long been banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , it happened in a legal grey zone , as everyone of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the affected person might have been exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where the per@@ missible limit was really exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he has always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is asser@@ ted that it is unfair to apply the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; par@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess has already been right .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ in@@ able and also not for what was left in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the ordinary . &quot;
this is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is to say , ear @-@ fig@@ s and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , he was also strictly adher@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his time in Regensburg has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; in the talks with you ? &quot;
did the subject matter examination also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , that the dom@@ es played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he led a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demands of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and cand@@ y alone one does not make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people do you have for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep @-@ believing and heart@@ felt people , from whom one could not imagine that he could only do something to a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his execution , visit him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and he is treated like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and whom they almost ven@@ er@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again quite clear : all you repro@@ ached him are educational methods that were at that time on the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just a man , just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him . &quot;
&quot; now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps in Germany , nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally to be in peace . &quot;
