<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">"an Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today."</seg>
<seg id="3">"a crypt chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this has to be exciting because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and congregations in the spread-area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large oversight map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called primeval sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were based on data from the Bayerischer Handel Statute, between 1810 and 1864, and the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon longed for an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical inclusion in Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops retire with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was the present neighbors who created the idea of an area-wide Bayern-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The flyer for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found like any other on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of former / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is the subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, as a district in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers" uprising against Austria in 1705. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the west park, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming a small-size map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written corridors from the so-called" "primitive record" "from which the land was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"today, small plots do not prove to be farmers - but small gardeners of the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 The site of the Oktoberfest, was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the territory of the today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name" at Gasteig "or" On the Air "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Münchner Kreis-Irrenaeanstalt "Auf der Auer Lünen" was created there.</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"furthermore, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who works for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients was first place, later on 500 places were enlarged."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular rotor in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"the football field of the TSV Munich East is located west, east of residences from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was built according to the original building of the Irrenburg, which had been destroyed during WWII by bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "main square" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs broke many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the pre-work and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn station."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Missouri State, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for special attention to afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents generally occur throughout the state and be noted here," says the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it difficult for people to win discrimination, as well as the State's prosecution authorities, which are disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights which happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are collapsed or killed," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances in the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol during the trip and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points out a recent report from the Missouri General Public Prosecutor's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state will keep 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "Chapel said."</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be prepared to bring it to Caution or let relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI investigation programme of the FBI, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration laws, which will contribute to further racial profiling according to the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher wide fence project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have gathered a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the court yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU town association met with the mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially granted insight into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young kittens and accommodated in five apartments Feriengouste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black Forest" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengeti there is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also known as BLHV-Chairman of Fishermen's bach, he described the" "elemental" "project as" "fundamental importance." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably operate on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much needed to be processed with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not conduct bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader support. ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the reforestation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operations," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers face criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced by the electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the conservation area is therefore 40 hectares, which can not be forked up to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs were subsidised from the total cost of 71 500 euros, one quarter was borne by the municipality of Fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac said:" "you do a really good job without farmers and virgins."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiß asserted that" "best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Architecture (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state promotion of willow-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to hold the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of a conveying balm designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the area to be fenced cannot be towed (slope rate over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisher-bacher masking project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the conservation area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump régime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated controversy with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the president to the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have lied to him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he grabbed its importance, and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, seventeen years after the completion of the memorial, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factual right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, your oppressed masses, who are longing to breathe freely, / the elderless waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "Waste Waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller had not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural engagement: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they did a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not one, but rather an early neo-conservative, who brings the American flame into the world around:" Lady Liberty is progressing. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh was quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a matter of point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, elusive but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump have ever wanted to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the power director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the world championship kader will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400-m-hurdles, says it" "incredible" "is that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads on this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain states that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me make it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well established athletes, athletes who want to climb on platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics via Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the indices of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers hit him for all, from home policy to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he pleaded with criticism, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led as sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">"and the American Civil Liberties Union, therefore, complained about it at the beginning of this week."</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval by the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hover.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - are unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, the spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing but a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hate-filled, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other topical news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governors of the governor described as" "concentrated anti-Spam attack" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to listen to a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same, that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest or arrest demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington's time, the time of affordable porn had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers was multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous pamphlets beat on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that suppressed Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>

<seg id="233">Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking annually," said Dr. Heiko Becher. "</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994."</seg>
<seg id="236">"at that time, there have been 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany."</seg>

<seg id="239">"the construction works in the Villingen Street are in full swing and" lie reasonably in time, "says the director of the yard Fred Heinze."</seg>
<seg id="240">"in the area of domestic connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as the underground is much more obscured, which is not noted in the plans."</seg>
<seg id="241">"traffic, which continuously hinders construction work, represents a major problem for the construction trupp of the firm Stumpp."</seg>
<seg id="242">"the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and lockouts is enormous," says Heinze. "</seg>

<seg id="250">"in her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regent in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally known as" nota "- directly in the fireplace."</seg>
<seg id="251">"after half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with diligently, unwashed hands and swallowed."</seg>
<seg id="252">"Degei sits on the loam floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water out of the nearby marsh."</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a hopeless space serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">"as the youngest of the four wives of her husband, her fields were not assigned."</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here."</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 5 pm," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was included in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up for independence against the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or judges."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, while the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island."</seg>
<seg id="261">Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted. the trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5 hour drive by car.</seg>

<seg id="269">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province where 28% of the people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inferiority and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">"the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="272">"in 2015 alone, Freeport was dismantled in value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper."</seg>
<seg id="273">"in addition, Papua has assets worth $78 billion in excess of wood resources."</seg>
<seg id="274">"these riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua who make sure that Indonesia's powerful military has preserved a suffocating presence."</seg>
<seg id="275">"a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport deposited almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer."</seg>
<seg id="276">Papuanian demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">"more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military."</seg>
<seg id="278">"mass killings in Papuas's tribal highland in the 1970s, according to the Asia-Human Rights Commission, were committed to commit genocide."</seg>
<seg id="279">"in the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year."</seg>
<seg id="280">"" "we Werder Everything Moving" "is called in a report by the Archdiocese Brisbane from 2016 where reports on atrocities in the previous year are, such as illegal directions and torture - rape and power failures are particularly popular after another report, and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations."</seg>
<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="282">The screws have strengthened because Papuas's resources are bringing an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="283">"the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic change is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi."</seg>

<seg id="287">"it took the native Papua, the mom-mom [the women] of Papua - cost her market."</seg>
<seg id="288">"in 2014, the Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokovii, promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="289">"the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta."</seg>
<seg id="290">"but in Papua has changed little, and today the locals are deceived."</seg>
<seg id="291">"our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokwai in 2014, with expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You. "</seg>
<seg id="292">"in fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokov's initiation in October."</seg>
<seg id="293">"on 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness."</seg>
<seg id="294">The frightened children told them that they should shut up their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="295">"one of the soldiers took a clash in their tone and later returned to four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai."</seg>
<seg id="296">"the soldiers who had drunk, hunted and beat the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children.</seg>
<seg id="298">"one child, the 16-year old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten up that he fell into coma."</seg>
<seg id="299">"a few hours later, the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day."</seg>
<seg id="300">"about 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice."</seg>
<seg id="301">They wore ceremonial hunting arches and carried the orphan dance - in a circle and imitated a bird singing - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some protesters began to strike stones on police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">"when the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio:" "if the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," "it says in an official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media."</seg>
<seg id="304">"Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, looked at the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home."</seg>
<seg id="305">Nobody was listening to the mood.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his multicolored painted wooden house. "</seg>
<seg id="307">"Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here."</seg>
<seg id="308">"it was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds. "</seg>
<seg id="309">"the native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, who witnessed the shooting."</seg>
<seg id="310">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was", "said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only bears a name, the TIME in gloomy mood."</seg>
<seg id="311">I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.</seg>
<seg id="312">"chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to" secure "their station because they were attacked."</seg>
<seg id="313">"we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," "said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015."</seg>
<seg id="314">"it is about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">"according to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more wounded."</seg>
<seg id="316">The messages on the killings occurred only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">"three weeks Jokazi in Jayapura had a passionate speech, in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and swayed to tackle the historic abnormalities in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="318">"I want this case to be solved immediately, so that it will not happen again in the future," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="319">"Wiranto, Security Minister, said in October 2016 that he set out an extrajudicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="320">But the excuses began almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="321">"most injuries occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="322">Some were in the 90-ern and the beginning of the 2000-s.</seg>
<seg id="323">"the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations, but there are processes that must be passed through," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="324">"then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5th in Jakarta and said, he has no plans to establish a complaint in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="325">"instead, everything is regulated by law," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="326">"Wiranto, accused by the UN for" crimes against humanity, "which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody struggle of independence from 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua were already included, including the Paniai incident."</seg>
<seg id="327">Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="328">"I was interviewed in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes. "</seg>
<seg id="329">"I am tired."</seg>
<seg id="330">He says he still lives in fear years later.</seg>
<seg id="331">"I'm scared," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="332">"I am afraid to be arrested by the military, scared of being shot."</seg>
<seg id="333">His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.</seg>
<seg id="334">He says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="335">"after I had buried the corpses, the military sought me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="336">The foundry has not ceased.</seg>
<seg id="337">On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood of Deiyai.</seg>
<seg id="338">"during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a Baufirma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, a person and 17 others were injured, including children."</seg>

<seg id="341">"the police said that the villagers threw stones on officers, who responded by firing up warning shots."</seg>
<seg id="342">But natives say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed one.</seg>
<seg id="343">"we were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly delivered, so the TIME. "</seg>
<seg id="344">"I hid myself two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai Parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always a clash for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua."</seg>
<seg id="348">"many joined the" Free Papua Movement "(OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by encouraging sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="349">"some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of" securing national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten place. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty strengthens the discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">"the little rice, which is sold in Enarotali, is too expensive for locals."</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">"they retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market."</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 Cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire Airport."</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive.</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, chairman of the board of Paniai. "</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, restrictions in the coverage of international media are tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported to Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, although the rare permits were given to them."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelin Kine, the deputy Asia-Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokov's campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's unrest provinces of Papua and Western papua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - launched the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua including Paniai shootings."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks. "</seg>
<seg id="373">People on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"as an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the human right ambassadors Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on May 4th, local people broke their silence and urged him" We want Freedom, "according to a source that also participates at the meeting, but wants to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia announced another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they will probably not vote for Jokovii again."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokovii is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal Council. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokovii to know that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobi says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokovii as a" "debt" "that he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai shot victims led to a final symbolic act of defiance: the bodies of an victim were buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that perhaps they will never come to justice, but at least they will not forget their crimes."</seg>
<seg id="382">"a member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus with her head. "</seg>

<seg id="421">Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk enjoys a huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">"so far, he has underscored that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation."</seg>
<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk has for the first time revealed another, less brilliant figure for the first time in the announcement of the recent quarterly report: the cancellations made on the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 reservations for the new car, whose delivery has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="425">"Musk admits: of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">"in case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds)" "Reservation agreement". ""</seg>
<seg id="428">"at present 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk cleared in a telephone conference with analysts."</seg>

<seg id="430">"his argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side."</seg>
<seg id="431">"last year, Tesla supplied 84,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="432">"in 2018, all models should be taken together - 500,000 to be one million by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="440">"a day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions smog-causing air pollutants."</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presents the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state-owned environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"it is a deadline, which ran for states on 1 October in order to comply with the Ozone standards for 2015."</seg>
<seg id="444">"Pruitt announced in June that he will delay the observance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfering with local decisions, or to hinder economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who, before his appointment as President Donald Trump, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma, has long been a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay the regulation of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the postage regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane lecks."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his downturn in ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"under earlier administrations the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines for carrying out and then to be charged by activating groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who complained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery-site in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m., is invited to a Serenade."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and promoters Tumlingens to their cause.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in the" "Württembergische Grundkundenbuch" ": count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the" "Vogbey" "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document according to the document, there was also a splendid courtyard on the hill beside the former parish church, to which the church or patronate law belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the local picture of Tumlingen, the" mountain "is the third, the splendid settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronism was originated from the early medieval right of yuan.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built, erected a church and occupied with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This entails the right to use a priest or propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greater of the two were crumbling on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during World War II in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were pushed and the belfry were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tummy Hilarius graveyard served as the last resting place for the dead from hearers."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilaruskirche collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">"in the New Year's Night of 1834, a storm split the steeple and half rushed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-building still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem will be the successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as organizers, the friends and supporters of Tumlingens invite on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade in the old cemetery of St. Hilary Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Architect Hartmut Romann speaks the concluding word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"at the end of the serenade, there is a refreshment in front of the cemetery."</seg>

<seg id="501">Serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organizers hope for many supporters to obtain the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of significance for tumours and hearers."</seg>

<seg id="511">"although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, the district government of Düsseldorf was not approved, because of a form missing."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the approved approval certificate is still illegal and therefore also declining," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council once again decided the windbreak zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending."</seg>

<seg id="863">"these were two counterparts too much, and we have to look even better in Aue," says the defense-player from Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the three-chain is to be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">And a gate after a freewheel doesn't want to catch up any more.</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more besides Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">"Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in the preparation with the three-chain, than with the four-chain."</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know yet how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Wohlel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we are in the three-chain at the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonise even better and we do not make so many playing mistakes in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but whether you can speak after a draw from a miserable start, don't know."</seg>

<seg id="873">"but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I leave the start into the season only after six to eight playing days," "said Friedhelm Wohlel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of Saxonia in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to an accident."</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season quasi with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann that the players from Aue might be even a bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascension favorite in the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know 100 percent where they are currently," says the defender of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday will enter the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, just because we have the right to come under the first six, is stupidity," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue out of nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Act) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor."</seg>
<seg id="887">"to date, migration has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older whereas in more 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in statistics of the past few months, the figures are fairly constant," he said the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases suggesting that the examined person was 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet searched for the 581 results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, for X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">"a sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus des Karolinska Institute, whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were usually going through puberty sooner or later than usual."</seg>
<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used."</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we can't say it safely, we should not do as if we could," he said to the newspaper metro. "</seg>
<seg id="901">"however, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests:" generally, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed issues of European soccer clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, because the executive organization that supervises the European game has the power to prohibit crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can safely make money loose, so that Neymar underwrites and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the wealthy ruler family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may use a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them the break-even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Platini, following his election as a UEFA president in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken huge debts in their quest for success, effectively deceive and risk to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich, originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential, and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a harder matter."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015 by the presidency, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to frighten away from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will determine the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week. "</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for billing on the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sum of EUR 44.4 million will be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at the time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to oversee their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a cataract company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"exactly this happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the World Cup 2018 Organizing Committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become the World Cup ambassador and will simply be able to find out such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive, try to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"they talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation."</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s, for the 90-years-Grunge period (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter passed the Sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd to greater things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">"but as a franchise, it feels like time is scarce."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a talking jar of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">By stiffing on the core of the gags - middle aged actors play horny children who are grown up - yet they managed to gain the impossibility to regain the last part of the heat.</seg>

<seg id="1190">"at one point, a character goes through an Apple Powerbook, some Inline Skates and" a number of other things from the year 1991. ""</seg>

<seg id="1196">"it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons sublippie of" Singles, "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"these are the moments of accidental delusion that may heat this franchise as a kind of repeating" Seven Up!

<seg id="1296">Preexpositions prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines can be taken every day or just two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>

<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is targeted and implemented in a large scale."</seg>

<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an intermediate floor to make the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot tall ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Fan had to think creatively to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked, without having to fill."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"not only was it to build a simple platform, but to attach the steel so that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is reciprocal, so it's very easy to slide the door."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will resell the base - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">In a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size.</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meter of some standard in something completely untouchable.</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate-imperial Victorias worth more than $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and their assets."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict about separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"following an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - written by Paul as the" main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">The court states that this means that Colin has property worth EUR 316 million and Paul amounting to 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be an issue for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also struggle for the control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded it."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues, this is not true, but raises Paul to manage some possessions incompetent."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early monkey-avit submitted by Colin, he says he hope to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs are in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies."</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">"Colin says he started West co there when he was" "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land from trial," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis group, whereas Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were, Paul says" on the conditions of their financial separation. ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin kept very restrained, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire is the best friend of television stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media recorded contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can really not say much" because the case before the courts is.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it's very, very sad, that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict," he said, adding that he still hope for a solution. "</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to hold the boss on a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior staff at his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wants to repair: bad news that comes into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"UTF-8 (Unicode, worldwide) utf-16 (Unicode, worldwide) utf-16 (Unicode, worldwide)"</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," "said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri said at the time that" the key to hold the Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady exaltation. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Bye Bye SuiPrincess</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Twitter's Twitter habit was ever" "under control" "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that trumps tweets would have included even more fuel without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees manage to keep his anger away from him a few times, their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently avoided trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May, about the preference of the advisers to supply the president for strategic reasons without doubt."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example written by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump-officials say that Trump as a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he insisted on finding out where these originate."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of the chicanes, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoke it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, the trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his advisers still strive for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1444">Birkenhof is owned by Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the Birkenhof hotel by the former Ambiente Company Ltd. April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue by the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed at that time."</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interest in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"with its headquarters in Bad Bergzabern, the Luisenhotels, with its registered office in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof have been building waste containers since a longer period before the entrance, and when entering the house it becomes clear that extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors have been torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old baths from the rooms are removed."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Until March there is still much to do.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "pretty cosmopolitan" "later, as Thomas Scherer has expressed."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery." ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, shearers emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to raise itself wide, explains Scherer further."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">He already led conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the external systems are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Representative sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russian affair about US President Donald Trump, Special speaker Robert Mueller is alleged to have deployed a so-called Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the committee recorded the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the station CNN reported, there are already first invitations of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin for a longer time to purposefully intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand who acted as advisors of the Republican candidate in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Special Representative Trump has personally moved into the centre and undermining the accusation whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the present evidence in possible interruptions, and decide whether to be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jurys are also called" "charges". ""</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the transmitter CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"apart from Trump Jr., also Trump Jr. were counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his team leader Paul Manafort during the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the suspension shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end, in order to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concerns of president Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the theme is giving the democrats a way to" feel good, "because they have nothing else they can talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special adviser Ty Cobb declared in a statement, he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but this work also usually in secret, he emphasised."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorses any action that accelerates the work of the Special Agency in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey told three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the Declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump have become loud, he has hindered the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following the presentation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent representative of the Congress, such as the Watergate Affair around the later recalled President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the margins of the president of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"there are two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday, according to which the special agent could not be easily dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant ice mountain drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg was solved by the scarcity of Berlin from the Schelhammer."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was divided into the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres big colossus now travel to the north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest iron giants who have registered researchers in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change plays a role in the breakdown of the iceberg, according to research data is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual cracks in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken-off colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Horseshoe floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">"thus, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly."</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C archipelago is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this archipelago was disturbed by the balance of waxes and abruptions a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete shot is broken down there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeits is in danger, as the front edge never withdrew as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be tracked if there is a piece of a key at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and pushed ice so much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of damage leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could potentially increase sea level, but only in a small extent, the British research project is writing to observe the Antarctic (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Larsen-C-Schelfeits is the fourth largest archipelago of Antarctica after AWI-indications, with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and there is no direct connection to climate change, the iron sign now arrives in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the record began," he affirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have disputed whether the Larsen-C Schelfeits will grow up again or go back in the long run and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said:" "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development would take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not return the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, however, in recent decades many ice-snuffs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data of the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline has contributed to the decline in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"in the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed by around three degrees and thus reaches the areas in which the temperature is the quickest."</seg>

<seg id="1562">"the aim is to not only cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application of the candidate."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include an education offensive, call CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>

<seg id="1572">"people want all possibilities to be checked, which allow exiting from the communal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the county administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a domestic tariff," "says races."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials better than the public service actually foresees."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available when switching to a higher stage oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the functions of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>

<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work on," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet', because their team had worked together effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself to detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor's Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organisation in a statement on social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge any allegations currently collected, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is suspected that its crew takes over dinghy migrants aboard, which can be delivered directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting occurred apparently only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the case of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone of humanitarian grounds, and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer in charge of monitoring their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined dramatically over the past few weeks, suggesting that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine willermer bikers, the" "Berlin Branch" "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region for four days to enjoy Trials and attractions."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three befriended guides available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents, for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again a lookout point at the lookout point, coupled with" fuge "Trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and return huts brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in the open air inhalatorium healing Sole.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt has been controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters in height, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gearing up for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of contacting with wind and weather over the stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-sport has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high slogans included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">They have also recognized the first federal authorities who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">"he is sure," "there are still many clubs on this train."</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the World Cup Football World Federation in London organized the first" Interactive Club World Cup, "where the gamers of various clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"apart from Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people will also go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-sportsmen under contract, it could be much more often present on these markets, than once a year to send the federal government to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What exactly is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in E-Sport, computer games like" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or the football simulation FIFA made FIFA on competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and with the Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to the norm."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobatic also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses, which one also finds in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also exercise their body and respect the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"but there are also problems:" "doping is becoming a topic more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrity of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are internationally on the road, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the company counseling Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predict rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to be 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"at about 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however," "e-sport" "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," "writes the Deloitte Consultants."</seg>
<seg id="1646">International are many countries already.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Big markets are Asia and the USA where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood Actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">"in Europe too, a lot is happening."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as instructional subject, says Frobatic."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the World Cup clubs are now under obligation to set up an e-sport department according to Dutt."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison Germany lags behind," explains VfB-Board Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only in nostalgia to fall away, and to clear the old times, is no longer enough."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company at the same time on the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digital world," says Dutt. "</seg>
<seg id="1656">It is not possible to hold that only in football everything remains as it was always.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy is forced to commit suicide</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were subjected to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was sentenced to Conrad Roy in June, who took life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is not comforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his call.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red pants and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have reversed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life in order to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she did not take responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters Attorney Attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance that they totally regret.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A public prosecutor read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy who said that there is "no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I turn around with everything. I try, despite all my pain, which we will carry for eternity with us for his sisters to be there," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys sister, Camdyn Roy said that she" "persecuted" "that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth, is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to claim someone else to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hook up, spring from a building, stab yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks prior to his death, while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" you have to do it, Conrad "and" Everything you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">"judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy's death, and ordered that she should take advantage of any press from the event."</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Amanda Knox was one of the few who defended Carter in 2007 because of murder of her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Knox, 30 years old, published a commentary in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison. "</seg>
<seg id="1689">Joshua Kimberly: learn from the new Mini-Lame of FC Bayern</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that Joshua Kimba was allowed to run as captain during the Audi Cup, is not a coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern dares a great season to the Confed-Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm there.</seg>
<seg id="1692">"what was different in his place in the cabin, that Joshua kissed me immediately, even if the additional piece of clothing was very, very small."</seg>
<seg id="1693">"but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer had to see, he made himself up to his arms."</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the coach has not announced it," said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first use as a Bayern-captain. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"well, the entrance could have been better than at 0: 2 against the SSC Naples."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But the sign of the coach kissed Kimi as well.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight year older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a leader in the C-elf out of youth players, debutants and just out of holidays, but he."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"sugar is distributed to those, which one likes to eat much, which you want to keep in good spirits."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"so whoever has been chosen to take the legacy of Lame, can only use a little extra motivation."</seg>
<seg id="1700">"Kimi confirmed:" "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old served as a mini-paralytic about the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"right rear, this is now its position, the white tie in the arm did its rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all, Kimi worked in this starting formation as the one who can best take the helm in his hand."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to steer the uncoordinated troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had a look at the whole, while many others were busy with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal thus, to overplay his lack of fitness (folding hardly); Renato Sanches to make out on devils come out of the services of the Asia trip (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle were not negatively charged in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot."</seg>
<seg id="1707">This worked quite well.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"sweet was running beside kimme, Rudy in front of the defense, both agitated sovereign."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli-storm was very difficult, and Süle also tried to get successful in the game building a few times."</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy admits that the result was "not as we had hoped for."</seg>
<seg id="1711">But also he showed a decent performance when the debut was made.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"shift, tempo change:" for this style I was also caught. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as usual this Bavaria-world is still for the new additions, one looked at the game afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"for example, in the Catacomben there were not one or two, but six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimi said goodbye to a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard of Süle an interesting sentence:" "what's going on here, I have already noticed."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"with Bavaria, you simply need to win any game."</seg>
<seg id="1718">"after all, he does not have to teach the new one any more."</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green) and Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">This shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak to T V demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer (VTU), says:" "Wisdom grabs the desires of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The main reversal sees natus in infrastructure policy: the gaps between the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau stand at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure, until 2021 is expected to be right."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank Trier, who is in the urgent need of the Federal Ministry of Transport."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"of course, natus sees a sign for supporting regional, but internationally competing companies."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) is aiming at the wine of a Rhineland-Palatinate-Label, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years."</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a callback.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support observance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"however, nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are regarded as carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the costs for automakers to install machinery for neutralisation of exhaust gases, which are exposed to diesel vehicles, also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of denying the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called anti-switching equipment that could regulate emissions to comply with the rules when a car was tested, but return to normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several employees were indicted by Volkswagen and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">"last month, the former manager of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany's engine development in Germany."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered as the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifetime of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small cicadas, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf-cades, and with very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">"lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics."</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the employees of the weekly Riodoce are normally meeting on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break-break from violence, and while the bodies are piled up throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is their editor and their inspirer of Riodosia, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico," Valdez has written in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word" Justice, "hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010 a Special Attorney General was established to deal with the cases of journalists, it only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with the thousands of killings linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in the case of Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting, even though the terrain is even more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little value, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the why, we misstrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15 Valdez finally left the office of the newspaper" "Riodoce" "in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "Twelfth River". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but for Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of 'rest' if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodosia, has broken the blame for he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalling antitrust authorities in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangs bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was Valdez had not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security, following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined the foundation of Riodoce with five colleagues and sold 50 USD holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug of drugs, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved performing harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs, wherever they lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What have you done in the face of so many dead men... why didn't you tell what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodosia team misses Valdez, the spawn-bird, who was able to curtail such a port-worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask," "Is his love for a routine his ruin?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death, too, forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and to stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and runways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer considered in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no cell phones allowed. days before, it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some reporters questioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers, who were not trustworthy of the Governor himself."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the edition of this week, Riodoce has licked on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state spending, concentrated on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all the political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this eatery, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers had seen Valdez's column as the best informed source of abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another reporter to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder throughout the country by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and killed them, because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked that she is re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an inordinate society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that Reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces, who put the organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media watchdog group" "Articulo 19" "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to hold the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1924">Now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable Nashorn of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even find that his flaky skin was reddish brown - and they said she had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the deadened dinosaur, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well-preserved condition has bloated researchers, which describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumping."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're only blinking a little, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriere.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found out that these herbivores, even though it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat eaters dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter shading which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed us to get better into his surroundings and to evade his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markenchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the contershading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the conterment is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta is by far the most living animals surviving."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by meat eating dinosaurs, that the evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the contershading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this nodoscope was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been the Cretaceous Period," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to study the animal on hints of his life, including his conserved Darmingen, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and tossed into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosator is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservative skate skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as same today as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous Period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaur, stood on two legs, permeated the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the surviving armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch-long tops raging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the submarine life of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Haugust still cover bumpy armoured slabs along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it gets."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot lies at his side, his five fingers are stretched upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1995">"currently, a test run operates on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"when the offer comes, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will be available at many other long-haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said a railway speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" calls the train card devaluation without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, some conditions have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to have purchased it via the app of the rail, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" "comfort check-in" "works: you step into the train, call your ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customer then appears a button for the electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">"if the train companion arrives at the ticket inspection at PLAY, he knows that there is a passenger with already devaluated online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can go to sleep, continue working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel safely without ticket control by our train attendant, check out the DB Navigator itself."</seg>

<seg id="2012">"who often travels, knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, the travel card controls belong to the biggest nuisances."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"because often you have, in any case, however one of the fellow travelers not all the documents required for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or your ID card is missing, or any other document that you have to show."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, leading to a bad mood in the section or greater room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other matters."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the road," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a picture of Browns lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," Ferrell was thinking. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people crying out, and from a man who claimed to be Browns's father who bore a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson Police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said that another policeman assaulted his rifle and screamed:" I will kill you... animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at that moment, I felt chills."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 11 o'clock, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas from 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown, after Ferguson, the two talked a conversation, which they had" over the black experience and the black condition countless times before this morning. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with her," Ferrell said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the happiness to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience a latent racism, she is no different from the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service, to keep her away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there Ferrell and her daughter connected to a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to assume for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism completely changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Ferrell in mind:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan has already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death-insect inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell nearer to the project, together with six other locals, the team of" Whose Streets "was followed in the years after Browns's execution."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people will be presented, for so I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells' experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but a community coming together," "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrum's life as she falls in love and married her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"moreover, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film" "BlackLivesMatter" "in social media after the killings of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "at which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, even though she was at the forefront because in a life on these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news media in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the theme hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery says," That's a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That's real great "(Nicole Schsten), comes from the other side:" don't need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, from which the remaining shops will benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone bleeds."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer's market stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction work, it will end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer's market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after building the gallery a chance exists to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct market marketers reside in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, the new project should not be very low."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping list in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the Markthalle remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the local rents are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"it is a shame that specialty shops are almost no longer, and what remains of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not suit me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit in to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"above all, where should the farmer's market hall be located during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery really comes at some point."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the specst bit gallery have been able to sell all shops in Bitburg before?</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "that will simply not work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarlem who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after being classified as a secret diplomat about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable resemblance)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has combined its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA derived from Manning, Dewey-Hagborg originated from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment, not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison had suppressed her image, so much that there was only one photo - a granny, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blond wig - associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hageland was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hageland with a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"she couldn't visit her at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse have become unequal bridespeople who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a cartoon by" "Suppressed Images" "by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president of the Overseas Judgment would transform and it would be able to personally see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, only a few days after the book was published, Obama would demand release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and heavy, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually solve."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her oversized signature (the" i "in her surname is equipped with a heart) an end of the" automatic fragmentation, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandmeter of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides in accordance with the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome is not responsible for who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spinal Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above comic amendment mentioned above."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she emerges from the disciplinary barracks of the United States such as King Kong with a free sprechtelefon.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they disguise your speech, they have won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition in person - as predicted in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed by the masks of their own genomic simulaceres, which gather as hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition, up to size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which her genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hageland from portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued an arrest warrant for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Court."</seg>

<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27, too."</seg>

<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "he added."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported findings of the doping approved by the WADA by the Canadian attorney Richard McLaren."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in relation to the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has got a mistake."</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have pulled off their tricot surfaces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of UCLA should begin at 19: 15 to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brothers moved to the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood performed practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They should hold 18 exercises in the course of August. 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an upheaval that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled" "Empty Families of Kent and Sussex", "Rhodes says."</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan ordered another 7395 coup leaders by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military.</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey on the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpulators have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the robot's eye colour over the shape of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would look a stepford woman progressively."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpulators have developed to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," "warms the True Companion website."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired of being fixed on conversation, or she can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female features, the allusions to rape when one goes a step on Frigid (i.e.: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxy behaved with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no roxxxy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not consider any sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is sickened out of the border zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or insulting, until they give permission to the free market."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has pretended to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of Magd ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no intermediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasurable slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"around the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it is in another context that this also entails significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left has been strengthened by Trump, but the horrifying effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the big possibility that his kittens will no longer meet us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is however an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans normalized" normalized, "which suddenly appears to be the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"I find myself nowadays about an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's uritant version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur to one as very mild criminal offences."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as unmeasurable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it surprised him that so far no application has been fulfilled."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is searching for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"with the exception of the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for a familiarization."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach works for the administrative community as a subcontractor, the applicant has to show appropriate conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but closeness to citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as good spirits between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back at the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the town worth life," he is sure about the building office and its staff. "</seg>

<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will strike at about 1.5 million euros," If we do it right, "Wacker appreciates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "all in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"for an urban master, there is a lot of play space available."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslachs own yard and gardener, much can be reacted in many ways."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"one can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green plants is often cited by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town as an ensemble under monument protection stands, it is important to" "have an eye for that which fits" "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the Stadtbaumeister carries a great deal of responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," in the end everything runs over my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">"in support and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (civil engineering) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years."</seg>

<seg id="2563">"if you want to be buried with Roland Wacker, after information of the city of Haslach, you should be able to present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with technical architecture and have good skills in the areas of construction and construction planning law."</seg>

<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike of the railway track transfer in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) to the leaderships."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were badly damaged by the fact that the anticipated freight had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Investigators go out of two male perpetrators and look for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the scene there were witnesses of a scooter and a bike rider.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lausannoyer realm," said ÖBB Speaker Christoph Posch to APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">The perpetrators would have brought themselves to a great danger and jeopardized the traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay of delay and the cost of rail transport, the railway subscribers could also come to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"all in all, to go out of a" substantial "sum, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south railway line could be led without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"nearly ten people had dropped off Friday afternoon, two of them concerned the long-distance traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains did not fall off, but they had a delay."</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB Speaker Christoph Posch about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while sufferers are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food are not penetrating into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in its bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the components of proteins to destroy the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"it proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet tolerant to tryptophan ate a tolerant, less inflammatory bowel chorus, when the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that favored tolerance when she found out that a group of mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, this did not have."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of mice were sequenced and there were found six species of bacteria found in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacking in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were missing an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they were obtained by L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria exerted on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleansed out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in people like mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control infections on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri."</seg>
<seg id="2604">Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "genius"</seg>

<seg id="2677">"in the area of restructuring II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was at least 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the previous renovations are a" success project "- it is important to also promote interior development, and not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the government presidency of Karlsruhe will receive the information that there will be a restructuring area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros are from the country, the rest from the community."</seg>

<seg id="2692">"in November or December, as soon as possible, the propositional complaint should be carried out in order to begin with the renovations in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann concluded that each commune must perform the said preliminary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">"it is about evaluating the conditions of urbanism, and decide when it will be rehabilitated and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a reclamation mark in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will once again come to sensations and make himself a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">"Gotzel emphasised, an essential success factor for the project is the involvement of the participants."</seg>
<seg id="2698">"this is why there will be questionnaires, which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and property sheet", "in which it deals with the structural condition and refurbishment views."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, taxpayers will cost up to 24,000 US dollars according to the military's data left to TIME Magazine."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American Construction Programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued alongside a ship from Maine, a fire brigade from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House's military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event of high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the Deputy Navy commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter crashed on the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 o'clock in the morning, until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 was vacated this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would be required for return flight due to the limitation of the service hours."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"during the event, the original flight crew was at the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time."</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings provided by TIME did not indicate whether a second flight crew was finally required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the provision.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," "wrote the commandant."</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant answered. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the airplane, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">President are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to demand its use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February Trump launched an investigation when the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services provided, and his Twitter account is full of messages that describe the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthusiastic about the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials," "said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX 1 crew often perform training flights in the Washington area and the South Lawn to enforce US President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 introduced 58 exercise landings at the White House in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted on the training requirements of the flight crew for the month, said one official."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"helicopters also flew 11 hours on that day for" "non-presidency support missions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman from Sikorsky said the company was not involved in setting up helicopters on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budget designations for the presidential ploughs, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things produced in America," Spicer said. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the State Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">"and I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to highlight that."</seg>

<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnes, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "stated after publication in front of the German press agency, he was expecting from former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Cathedral Chapel Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would be very useful to the Catholic Church's reputation, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand criticized that in reporting about violence in the domain cats with" two measurements "was measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful deeds "which would be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you like to go to the church and that is a devoured Fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows a very normal pedagogical means" "had been" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports of the abuse of abuse, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the" My Brother of the Pope "with Ratzinger, writes (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger's protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which the Lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the diocese Regensburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"altogether 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high levels of emotionality the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims were estimated to appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories of him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Ezemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "incidents of violence against victims of protection at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "shows a contradictory picture of the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students are raising his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as choleriker and perfectionist who became handsome of the greener, when a cathedral spatz brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses of violence at the pre-school occurred outside its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is best to reproach him, experience it too late or have not taken the first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the domain gymnasium on which it worked was felt by virtually all respondents as - literally -" "redemption," "" "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger, a very excellent witness, describes it as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding "," as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always moved from grapes of children." "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to outruders."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only knock on the floor with chairs and cast the keychain on the floor, but also distributed ear cowards and enjoyed too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he regrets himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question of time, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced it in a worldly school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it actually is about this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the extradition of violence at the preschool, these are certainly digging."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it is a question of whether it's not a matter of familiarity with him and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many of the media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many people who never understood Him still work zealously."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, a lot of abuse has been reported on the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger put in the final report any involvement or complicity in regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one of those affected by the other," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus leader, who had professionally been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-disciples Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuses?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have prevented the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, to assume that they have settled... boy impenetrable, or more clearly or more, than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the student and / or the environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of not being able to prevent or advertise him."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "violent excesses" were to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "disposing" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael hesemann: this is the big problem that everything mixes and mixes everything into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, this is precisely what is the abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"in fact, it is clean separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents of the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly channeled and portrayed, and among them horrified, happened at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have occurred."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got to face the boys when they were already on the domain gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as most witnesses stress, the subject" preschool "taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"you were only happy to be able to escape, and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" heavenly "conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the secondary school gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" "many victims would appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most, the accusation remains to be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently devoured the ears from the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domain gymnasium, who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," that in the pre-school the investigative punishment will continue to be practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent move."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test punishments have long been banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it happened in a legal grey zone, as everyone of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where the affected person might have been exaggerated or dramatized, and where the permissible limit was really exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he has always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it is unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael hesemann: we historians are talking about the" parachronism of anachronism, "i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not for what was left in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the ordinary."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, that is to say, ear-figs and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970ies."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, he was also strictly adhered to."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his time in Regensburg has given Georg Ratzinger for the book" "My Brother of the Pope" "in the talks with you?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject matter examination also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, that the domes played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't know that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demands of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and candy alone one does not make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have for Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, deep-believing and heartfelt people, from whom one could not imagine that he could only do something to a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his execution, visit him regularly, visit him - he is almost blind - and he is treated like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up today and whom they almost venerate."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again quite clear: all you reproached him are educational methods that were at that time on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relieved him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the state of affairs, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps in Germany, nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to be in peace."</seg>
