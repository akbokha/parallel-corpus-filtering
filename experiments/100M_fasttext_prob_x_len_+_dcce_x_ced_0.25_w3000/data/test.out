28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping center .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia , was identified in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was considered murder and the investigations were running .
&quot; brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man for the son &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working as a close family and we will miss him , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia noted that Frank was initially living in Host@@ els , but that , &quot; things finally went up for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone , who would harm his younger brother . &quot;
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; combining his kind with his family was to cook us a little while preparing for dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lit up every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information on the case is requested to invo@@ ke the SF@@ PD hin@@ ge on the 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
that &apos;s what the Hollywood star has made in an interview un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear now .
&quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or get stuck from the outside label , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about that she is considered &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , preferably TV with loose w@@ rist@@ bands and mex@@ ican food , is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she brings the question of the desire of children : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a children &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all @-@ embr@@ acing mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us starting August 25th .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger experim@@ ented with some colleagues a little change with a ride on the beach . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alled their holidays , they went home to the feed trou@@ ghs after a quick gal@@ lop . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
and so the mount @-@ career ended again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he let his family run over the AL@@ RV site , and he didn &apos;t even dare to take pictures for a horse . &quot;
it was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite impressive .
the German sports assistance handed the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Gol@@ dene Sport Pyram@@ id .
there is no lack of awards to the sympath@@ etic ath@@ lete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes bay leaf , Champions Tour Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already ad@@ jured him .
the 18th prize @-@ winner of the Sport Pyram@@ id is long .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for athle@@ tic achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent for decades .
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros as well . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the second @-@ time U.S. Mast@@ ers@@ ner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the real Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sport@@ s@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and P@@ umps economic policy compared : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade deal T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US Pres@@ idential candidates are un@@ equal in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
that is about the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep the case rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax@@ ies the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ted Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely lag behind regulations , and he will be strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would be increased for the rich , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost identical . &quot;
the democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ owned tea party wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; on Tr@@ ump , so even party discussions could come . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to announce the climate protection treaty in Paris . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , with its investment program , Clinton explicitly wants to extend and claim the renewable energies : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the United States do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should then be paid better , demands about Clinton . &quot;
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage does not have to be changed , he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands tr@@ ump , which wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics point to him so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers shelter .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles and k@@ is@@ ses the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a provider of social services in Bavaria and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for all @-@ minded women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs established the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Help Centre . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not have any - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten the torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; women predomin@@ ate other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced observation , honor killing , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
&quot; on the run , this goes on . &quot;
&quot; that tu@@ gs for instance demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and at worst ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this means that about 90 per cent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traum@@ ati@@ sed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created . &quot;
many women are accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since she often doesn &apos;t want to help , it requires more accommodations only for her , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction , some reply with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , wing@@ ed women are not stored separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Francon@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central lod@@ gings only for women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published by the Committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing or if men and women are lod@@ ged together , it may be - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; as much as women feel this need of protection , one can read the crowds using the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily arrange a second house .
veter@@ in@@ aries strike : demands for new labor fighting measures
assistant veter@@ in@@ aries have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their dispute concerning a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire council to appro@@ ve more labour measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that the ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; had problems , which resulted in the contract being rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for official new negotiations to all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee today provided a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaigns that began in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to the fact that the veter@@ in@@ arians discussed six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the B@@ MA Assistant Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , after the election , came back to the rejection of the agreed terms of contract recommended by the B@@ MA . &quot;
&quot; he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions , which took place before the vote of 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , stating that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight months war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t refuse the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile was gre@@ edy and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for its restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if nothing bad happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustained cooling showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ turn of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was floo@@ ded .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back .
&quot; the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was committed by a presum@@ ed friend . &quot;
building the etr@@ acker again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited his own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ence .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been enth@@ ron@@ ed by his ministry last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ mes@@ hed ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television forecast for cheap fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry on the West , as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail rate of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ ping out to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian leader won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that drive away from the West and are badly treated and now alli@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said they had not even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tionally left it on a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey dis@@ covers the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Management Board , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer finance brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and stock exchange are changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customer business that will gain more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand , as well as the brand that our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of the brands , for how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these trademarks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these trademarks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;

Russian Putin fired Head of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ issed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the closest confidence cycle of Putin many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed the Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that , without giving reasons , &quot; &quot; the discharge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been representing Ivan@@ ov &apos;s pro@@ stitute since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief executive and chief executive of the government personnel . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding legislative proposals and controls to implement your instructions .
&quot; Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post , and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor . &quot;
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants for a long time and works as he is for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff rec@@ edes at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; so , is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ? &quot;
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man , who once was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , said Ivan@@ ov , &quot; it is true that I asked you early 2012 in a conversation , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to confi@@ dently entr@@ ust for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia since a third term of Putin would viol@@ ate the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producer
Gib@@ son was involved last month in a physical examination at the set of the show in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios who produce the series announced their dism@@ iss@@ al in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al . &quot;
on the set it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I rep@@ ent the incident , &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details about how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , followed by a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put all my heart blood into the last twelve years , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a release published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series . &quot;
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could act on sand@@ als that were sp@@ her@@ ed by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives approx . 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish . &quot;
ferry crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north @-@ deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; that are approaching completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first , who went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of truly epic proportions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot in Ros@@ y@@ th today , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering .
&quot; after the installation of the last block of the road and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ deck installed in the expansion , we then had to close the existing gap on the north or west side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern accommodation bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by approximately 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances , on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side , they were only a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; lucky yet to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men still have &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; after thrown off fishing boats in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue unit sounded alert on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved on from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst off , &quot; &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w the boat apart from their reach , until we left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a boun@@ ce hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue unit
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have been un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ oting engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened when the boat was dischar@@ ged by the person who was steering the boat . &quot;
&quot; today , someone has wo@@ ken up about these men . &quot;
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
instead the alcoholic gra@@ ders cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and at the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ armed then his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sh@@ ou@@ ted his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens think : investors should be put into duty much more in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that in the next few years Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 budget apartments ?
&quot; the SPD invites a &quot; &quot; Action Concept Living &quot; &quot; at the next meeting of the council . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a settlement is missing so far .
&quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , will in future need to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the affordable apartments can also be built in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; the big dispute in the Town Hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors in such areas to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the flats as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing loan program , which will cost millions of money and needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er jobs for investors .
&quot; despite the so @-@ called Brat@@ man , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is increasing . &quot;
&quot; if the scope of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one compare the loss of more around 1300 low @-@ priced apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the planning policy maker Nicole Palm should now be acqu@@ itted from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring flats back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western town .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the western town there are periods of time for the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments could be picked up there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this does not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the West Bank is increased dras@@ tically again , one removes oneself from the objective of so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social welfare in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect there will be even more movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
I concentrated on more constructions for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t exclude each other .
&quot; of course , I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture fell the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are followed by a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograp@@ hed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an Apple Watch app , followed by 3@@ 5,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of downstream people who exercise 30 minutes each day jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take 30 minutes to &quot; come out of the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active &quot; every day , &quot; b@@ ump@@ ed on de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring and people come to look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; whoever is driving sports regularly , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships at the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also metric game spo@@ ilers that always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people hunting , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ er@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now finally also Olympic winner .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American tur@@ ner kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; cre@@ w@@ men A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating beams during the sing@@ ular@@ ity campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and , in total , the fifth as she soli@@ di@@ fies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success makes them in the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected her a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between the picture and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while on the farewell party Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i had served as ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long run , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - included in their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no longer a competition competition , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though Must@@ afa was slightly guided by two turns , the picture f@@ lowed . &quot;
floating beams and dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lou@@ dly .
&quot; she repeated with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced her gently as she expected her end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collecting book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze was in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man captain , who is called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground practice , she cast into the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in the car when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks for a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , since the att@@ acker took not the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that fo@@ undry has led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; all in all , seven people were killed in His@@ panic pre@@ occup@@ ations within four months and two more wounded . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; says Howard of K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ l from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it wasn &apos;t unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ es and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother . &quot;
&quot; however , as the least of his contemp@@ or@@ aries , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t manage it . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage it .
wher@@ eup@@ on I did not let go of it .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , you have been involved in it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; Vincent and her husband have been told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first reply was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help of a help@@ desk .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Ed@@ mund worked for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him a symbolic language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented several signs on his own .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of the C@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the C@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ds cause b@@ ail@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency at Friday . it is expected all Saturday about with more rainf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Mississi@@ ppi , floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vessels , boats and sand bags multip@@ lied . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over long distances in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
weather service reported that additional 3 to 5 inches may drop in rain in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday while it was still raining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that an up@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as the floo@@ ding rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the River Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday . &quot;
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of flood in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight . &quot;
&quot; he said that a further step@@ son , who lives nearby , would have warned him . &quot;
&quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water came and came in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a stron@@ gh@@ old of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ds &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities hes@@ itated for ev@@ ac@@ uation operations . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported rain from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was considerably fully con@@ gest@@ ed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of residents from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching crew in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a coun@@ cill@@ or in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa reported 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches which were now both floo@@ ded .
&quot; the leader of Rob@@ by Miller &apos;s community said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals , which were washed by the floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodation was set up to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will go back to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozens of roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags were provided for residents to take away who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Mississi@@ ppi , the disaster manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy des Har@@ rison Count@@ downs said that it was still raining at the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a handful of houses on Thursday will be reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday no one has been reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; enriched by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves fo@@ undry in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tell us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the l@@ ender , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital in his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was en@@ gros@@ sed by balls , &quot; &quot; distributed his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined whether the perpetr@@ ators could be among one of the injured men .
&quot; investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that , apparently , it had come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , approached the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is definitely an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; there have been several armed fighters involved here who were very active involved , &quot; said police det@@ ective Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di , the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles made in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and police , according to reports , report@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ r@@ ack@@ et by the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still searching for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I &apos;ve been there for every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ di@@ son Ko@@ cian , who is Kath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas had been a surprising Olympic champion and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tik@@ rout@@ inen . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so do not see gy@@ ms in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ di@@ son to make it the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are expensive sports and gymn@@ asts in the first place in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents , who pay for the training , training , travel , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these ver@@ teb@@ rates lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the municipalities the countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
I founded my foundation of 20 years .
&quot; during my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international champ@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which brings thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ di@@ son for this genuine depic@@ tion of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the hol@@ ing of the Olympic team @-@ golf and thank you , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant physicians wish to organize more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assistant physicians who voted for a vote refused . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans revealed plans to introduce the treaty for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care of ast@@ er@@ isk movements . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair of the B@@ MA Committee for Assi@@ sts , announced last night in a message saying : &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and to treat it to all doctors . &quot;
&quot; at only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of B@@ MA to resolve disputes due to conversations struck in the government on account of reluc@@ tance to participate and sometimes in de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to the promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made it last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistants . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further labor fighting measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain cover . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association officials .
&quot; the B@@ MA wants better weekly compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 assistants who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , asked the assistants to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working combat measures do not achieve anything that is little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we have spoken to the committee of the assistants and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ stle @-@ bu@@ c@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the drug @-@ inhibit@@ ing drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and c@@ log the flow of blood to the brain causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the Bri@@ li@@ que trade name , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot;
&quot; the introduction of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90 mg of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE healthcare assessment center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the effectiveness and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness lets elections flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption caused by corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread adoption in Muslim communities as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member , Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town houses for ignor@@ ing the evidence of election abuse because of &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral channels in order to protect po@@ etic voters . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended that voters should carry out a proof of identity , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes , not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they vote their vote to prevent anyone to choose twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demanded that the press should have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves for election fraud , but also aims to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial crisis that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in East London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be given to corrupt and illegal practice of his office after a lit@@ any . &quot;
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia alleg@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person sel@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letters of letters - in which the older members of the Muslim community made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leaders of ways to prove their identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; evidence has been suggested that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to vote according to the will of the El@@ derly , in particular communities with a Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
&quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists work brief@@ ing documents to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list for immigration and social fraud . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
use non removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she gave her voice to prevent anyone to choose twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic postal code .
prohibition that political activists work complete brief@@ ings and envel@@ opes from letter elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ off for election stations . &quot;
a change in law that facilit@@ ated an accus@@ ation for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the re@@ pres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ Adver@@ tungs@@ gesetz - 1983 ) .
photographer prohibition in elec@@ tive @-@ stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting system ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees rule out normally that elec@@ tors go alone in the electoral cab .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that there was no criminal complaint after the Tower Ham@@ lets .
&quot; the court ruled Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; check@@ out controls &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ encies of the town council . &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Tower Ham@@ lets in Tower Ham@@ lets was a warning signal .
&quot; our country , as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
&quot; fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , aside from the rim and the band , which proved to be an impressive double @-@ rat@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games is by far not the only ath@@ lete to compete with gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if one is allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces running on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Hunter and Wolf : team member of the US team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the racing track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks closely resembles the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media and adm@@ its that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity except the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa , with her big expressive eyes , is supposed to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
&quot; and in the pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years . &quot;
one gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor .
&quot; another stop was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal at Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American received Nathan Adrian from fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory into space : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the res@@ emb@@ lance of the couple .
a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular clubs include K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese Flo@@ wers have died like a pig
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds &apos;s analysis of the fourth place of 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at dr .. 200m Fre@@ estyle swi@@ vel emp@@ ath@@ ed viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
&quot; the Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; as called &quot; &quot; and during the race , like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he had his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been caught up in the comment@@ ator team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; he could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , went as low , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese flo@@ wer@@ in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming set 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor tail , allowing the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; died &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not get caught that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows on the fin@@ als 4 x 200m of the outdoor swimming boots for women : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the cl@@ asp , baby . &quot;
the criticism of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard in which many people were talking to him
&quot; Twitter users did not stop when they heard , how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was &quot;
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you present the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like rac@@ ists . # p@@ elt .
&quot; a short time later Scott Russell ap@@ ologi@@ zed , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ happy formulation , sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russell had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible that it was broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers for broadcast and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media . &quot;
&quot; in order to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the float and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Day in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ turn , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred myself to the performance of the Flo@@ at , and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed by woman who tried under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at how she looked at it , pulled her off and put her back to the shelf . &quot;
she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark Shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she came back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the tray , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the top , pulled her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she simply stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled off the under@@ pants , who obviously didn &apos;t like them , as they put them back to the shelf again . &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided she didn &apos;t like to go back and out .
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b her that she was observing someone - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how reluc@@ t@@ antly to think someone would take shelter with home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I got along , people tried to draw clothing out of sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate it to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had dressed her and went out and they were not washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against weapons by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Verband in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , you should first turn around so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; hit it with the knee in the bar and spin , while the att@@ acker is cl@@ inging together before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of his grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that when a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to over@@ ride your money , unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide@@ book his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis of a serious test - filling some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k dropped his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a rail@@ ing head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before le@@ aking up any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and to show us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ ey &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light . &quot;
&quot; the thought of le@@ asing the sink head of a train toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately nothing left what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ els , travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public rail@@ ings to train stations to flus@@ hing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task set his immune system defini@@ tively under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film , he said : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to live up to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of fresh @-@ washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to le@@ ak after their L@@ umin@@ ometer was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ ey &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst I have in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will do nothing here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ ey &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian to Ian .
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film director , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to le@@ ak them and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by vali@@ o from 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents studied l@@ actic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys before del@@ og@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because she terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls had fl@@ es@@ y holes , wooden pl@@ anks were ri@@ pped , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated at the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is in@@ famous and their reputation is too .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , inti@@ mid@@ ations of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ eton , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; they were in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden pl@@ anks are ri@@ pped . &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called to call the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing has del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week by for@@ ci@@ ble the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had fo@@ amed the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously agreed on us and have given us the information provided . &quot;
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and convey@@ s the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the floor
workers in the house administration will now have to inc@@ iner@@ ate garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ ni@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don got a fine after having found guilty of ownership of a class B drug in trade .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 during a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many room walls of the house were lab@@ eled with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
police say they will del@@ og@@ ging ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
&quot; by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , Angela C@@ row said that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not comply with the rules of the house . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after a ne@@ ph@@ ew military beach over@@ flies the beach
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ esque P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the air forces placed an incredible assault flight
&quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk &quot;
this was the moment when the fri@@ ghtened tourists start panic after a ti@@ ghter jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew close to the sun@@ rises on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed on when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers , posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it really flew past two times and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ yo added : &quot; &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew amaz@@ ingly low
&quot; the Portuguese Air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast , thereby having to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that due to bad visibility , the jet flew a little deeper than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security was at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people came to death on Madeira island . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his point of view &quot;
&quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise . &quot;
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries against Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step towards the first win in the new football season .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the return play goes three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Double@@ Click has to for@@ ego N@@ ey@@ mar , with the under@@ lined cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning Europa League champion among others , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter is missing . &quot;
&quot; in the training , the German suffered a change in lig@@ aments in the knee , with which the inquiry at Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied at least in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete in Barcelona for two years now for the status as number one .
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique had so far declined to make a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other cont@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory match of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really want to convince at the 3 : 2 in Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
&quot; Sevilla , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven successes , Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition . &quot;
MA Long in its own league to table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12 : 4,4 ) . &quot;
&quot; thus the world rank@@ ings first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tournament and even Olympia . &quot;
&quot; bronze went to the Japanese , Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani . &quot;
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title with each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of Olympia was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between the sentences and with time @-@ outs they had no coaches . &quot;
they had gone back to the grand@@ stand and left their def@@ enders at fair competition on their own .
&quot; the matches until now , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
MA had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the tempo at the top and left Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
&quot; nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking ball @-@ changes to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the match for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion , Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had drag@@ ged a ri@@ ppy injury , afterwards in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similar high table tennis old Olympia @-@ V@@ etter . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump adm@@ its ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states to lose its majority . &quot;
the presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Repub@@ lican stron@@ gh@@ old of Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ track and self @-@ confident multi@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own repub@@ lican camp from the race , there is now doubt about his success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilty were false reports of his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot;
repub@@ lican high @-@ bur@@ gers tor@@ ch
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , lay down . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see dump in the front , but not with the distance that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the Sen@@ ders CNB@@ C , Tr@@ ump responded to the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and sne@@ ak afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he does nothing else than telling the truth .
&quot; if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was ok , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger for Congress . &quot;
Olympia : three Sc@@ ams at D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipline mission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face a threat after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee immediately agreed to establish a disciplinary mission in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan officials told us that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine specimen at the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this was reported to the team management of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case to rig@@ or@@ ously set up its own investigations - an IA@@ AF spokes@@ person .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , handed over and signed , &quot; &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the Ac@@ credi@@ tation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for the training control of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I turned into Beijing WM @-@ fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
&quot; four days before the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation , Michael Rot@@ ich , had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games . &quot;
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , Kenya has been under special observation in the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2,000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio games , it was usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law has been adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the WA@@ DA &apos;s rules . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports from the ARD , alleg@@ ations were raised again and again that in Kenya , dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible and there is a substantial ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport was area @-@ deck@@ ing and systematically thought @-@ opt . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic car couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; Salzburg conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth dimension .
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Lady plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mari@@ as &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character I have as a Roman lady , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
&quot; for him , conducting is a necessity . &quot;
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a more southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is up @-@ to @-@ date , the West Side Story : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans moved to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday . &quot;
Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family &apos;s details after she had for@@ s@@ aken the war @-@ torn country and to return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as warning and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with going to a war area - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school girls from east London went into an airplane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ ah &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months became a wi@@ dow .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , in the event of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Sen@@ at Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell is that the next president will appoint the successor to the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he would expect Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he did not speak with Clinton , whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate . &quot;
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge of the U.S. app@@ ell@@ ation tri@@ bunal for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID , Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were Lak@@ ai@@ en and Hel@@ per Workers of the Repub@@ lican Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he also noted , Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency . &quot;
Tre@@ ats wants N@@ ude @-@ Calendar for &quot; Women and for Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works together with photographer David Belle@@ ville to bring out a 70 @-@ year Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked men , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year , that his neck @-@ magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently it is the view that the Calendar also does .
&quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the release of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts on mass cur@@ sed
&quot; who doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ approaching Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany counts on short notice with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh front of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand protection @-@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime comb@@ ats the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had left Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ alties a few months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after the secret put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees , produced refugees in their own country , said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Association of Represent@@ atives compl@@ ained the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in cities of Alb@@ any . &quot;
&quot; with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the out@@ cry pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CD@@ U member . &quot;
the chief officer called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; is held against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len practitioner destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ approaching Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported under appeal to numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum @-@ holders accepted in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all identified as asylum seek@@ ers ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is no wage wage before war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum enti@@ tles according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not vote the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; since idi@@ otic than so far , it is not : summer holidays , heat and land ground combat - that bit@@ es up . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the champ@@ ions , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers , who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so may not choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; to do so , practical problems come : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang on posters , infl@@ ating ballo@@ ons , distributing fl@@ yers , and counting on the end of the vote , only work with difficulty . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again been forced to pass a campaign close to the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strongly new Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition times .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign for election . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distributing ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel gives Merkel the blame on the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; We are creating that &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it &apos;s when you are at the right place at the right place at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to show her the German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not vote , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is too bad to anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel can listen . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely elimin@@ ates the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country the base is br@@ ittle , that it must be very stringent , to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; it goes on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the vast expan@@ se of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ Elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it is , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , should make the leap into the country day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and put their campaign largely into the Internet .
&quot; online campaign , &quot; says the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green poll@@ utes go on track search for local stimulation with tourists . &quot;

B@@ 27 Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : Gast@@ stätten suffering from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those who are responsible for construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am and only end at the age of 20 , there is praise everywhere . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything quite che@@ ap@@ ly , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet petrol station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; the reci@@ proc@@ ity of those responsible for construction works is also v@@ owed , for example when it comes to the establishment of mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft drives . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was emig@@ rated on Monday to the south and also the locking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been cancelled , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again exists , the traffic situation within the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now go back on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 .
the ev@@ asion by the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for traffic engineering . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not met , the community called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were significant exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who made himself informed of the situation . &quot;
two to three per minute have been escal@@ ated .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again . &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 renovation has led to sales breaks with them , everyone can look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; so for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation hardly has consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also adm@@ its that of course &quot; &quot; the drive is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily explo@@ ded are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; road markings have thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it also has to bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the renovation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other country circles , where so much more funding has been handled . &quot;
&quot; in all passages , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive , it is also elsewhere beautiful . &quot;
&quot; that his tribal client@@ ele returns to the end of the refurb@@ ishment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of B 27 construction on his clients for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly being screw@@ ed against laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a big security package . &quot;
but what has a status of dump@@ ing to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promise .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; well , I took part in this . &quot;
&quot; but as Minister of the Interior , however , he was situated on results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère submitted a little bit of time before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; quite well @-@ known , announced , announced , that a new security authority to deal with the cris@@ p communication is not new . &quot;
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger information and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for safety authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD until now : he wants to pun@@ ish sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck the ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; explains the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still maintains that for reasonable and demanding nothing , which in the case of the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist anyway has no chances . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a safety check .
&quot; in cases of neg@@ ations for ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately cast their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some people still have an unpleasant effect and leaves questions un@@ answered .
&quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of pati@@ ently for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees . &quot;
and things that were deeply devoted to human beings did not cling to election times .
the inner security has enorm@@ ously moved into the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the Social Democratic Party are becoming increasingly in position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , between the two parties , it was high . &quot;
&quot; only a clever quar@@ rel on the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister of Interior , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ eur also calls for a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also deals with con@@ cili@@ atory tones .
&quot; from a revers@@ al of the double pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
to re@@ open it is not sensible .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must still show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could cause disputes .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing safety . &quot;
&quot; still , Volkswagen is still going through . &quot;
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs smoothly .
&quot; in the case of the recall action , there is ver@@ teb@@ ra@@ e about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts restra@@ ined in the second half of the shipments .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand worldwide sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales accounted for 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
in the home market Germany the deliveries increased by almost one sixth .
market @-@ driven manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a purchase restra@@ int due to &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding Turkey &apos;s coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on exit from the EU also explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , another minus is also available . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales plan from January to July .
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen has been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust system .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars for conversion into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the retro@@ fit , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car manufacturer will provide a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate to the customer after the conversion , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
firm of the Year for Compliance Audi@@ ts and Inves@@ tig@@ ations Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen acquired its German customers a guarantee for re @-@ equipped diesel models now .
&quot; this would have been confirmed last Monday , VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; declared Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after retro@@ fitting , and all type approval @-@ relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in company travel .
&quot; in the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , half a year after the conversion , customers can come into a workshop for half a year - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires sufficient savings in future pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; the bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : normal as@@ parag@@ us must &quot; &quot; not be afraid of paying for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; if banks store money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay its 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of Privat@@ - and corporate clients for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 people will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time , he kept 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to another and which he could not exploit . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for every million 4,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the cost is now passed on . &quot;
&quot; leaving the cash in the saf@@ es of the Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank officer . &quot;
most customers would have understood and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry it alone , &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People &apos;s and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay coverage of deposits for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is equipped with a little more opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if it ski@@ ps money for free . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branch offices in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and business@@ men live in the region . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative federation of Bavaria &quot; &quot; is currently no further banks known to calculate a compensation set for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Raiff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to neg@@ ativity is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not be able to please this in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who does buy vinyl records ?
l@@ ent men of middle @-@ aged men love plates .
&quot; before comm@@ itting to the comment section , to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ mon@@ ene Men &apos;s middle age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not attribut@@ able to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely breed group . &quot;
it is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of you@@ go@@ v vote ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild gra@@ zing before I stand , holding my hands and a certain level of determining how : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic board specialty stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I originate from S@@ ister Ray ( data count : two young women , three middle aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( numbers : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards . &quot;
&quot; these vinyl records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and bought items which he sold when he was young and ready . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers , who he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and see to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually get rid of their collection in the same way around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom in followers of the record @-@ revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound@@ track sleeves , from items that aw@@ aken lucky charm . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or poss@@ essions of material poss@@ essions than a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; a staff but@@ ton@@ ed out of a stack of tiles . &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened .
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy one record , do not have turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while I was pu@@ zz@@ led by a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( quantity : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a tro@@ phy aspect of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more pro@@ voc@@ ative , less musi@@ cally . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who only slowly enter . &quot;
&quot; opp , which has dedicated the record almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I enter . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ ist Pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ en@@ urs out of the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks stran@@ gely lonely , but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ mas are hard to fix when standing next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she rather makes a shopping basket as a big shopping .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a dist@@ orted si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the impression to sample the jeans @-@ Hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v votes , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , have not taken into account the large number of female collectors and turn@@ tables that exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning surely not talking about plates from the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who over@@ looks the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French court re@@ jects deal on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; in case of a trial this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which bear a fire and San@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups , would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also realized that the provisional businesses and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely nour@@ ishing people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer calm matches between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in a community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of migrants in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance at the olymp@@ ic time , cyclists don &apos;t want to stop Tony Martin . &quot;
&quot; I continue to keep the World Cup in sight , remain confident and fight further , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I hon@@ estly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must quietly analyse the reasons behind the de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the time driving Championship in October in Qatar , Martin really wanted to compete for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times .
&quot; this also includes my position , &quot; wrote the triple @-@ time World Champion , who had lost more than three minutes at the Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s Ras@@ mus@@ sen must adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new lightning sets are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic en@@ forcement trailer from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used for accident issues , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or bridges with temporary speed poles , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary wind tunnel for compl@@ ying with speed limit . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex . &quot;
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation ; the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as driving ban on time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; depending on the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring system so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also sh@@ uss@@ proof outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer is being tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and meanwhile also used . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , following an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ od@@ oro stage here in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji granted a master class in handling , side @-@ st@@ epp@@ ing , draw@@ backs , scheduled flight and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was lost due to the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; here , they only lost one . &quot;
&quot; this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji was stun@@ ned and caused the attacks of GB@@ s out of fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , J@@ erry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner that he transformed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a h@@ yst@@ er@@ ous T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua takes a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still cores . &quot;
this is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favor of the South Sea sul@@ tan@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags flew and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ am put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB kick@@ ed crus@@ hing in the lawn . &quot;
earlier in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a close half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a door among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer for a rowing victory
there will be no emot@@ ive gold than those games and that wants what is called .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she stro@@ ve to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second place without a tax wife , the first women in the history of British sports who laid such a benchmark . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 39.@@ 000 un@@ disputed use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the way of triumph to ge@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference , and nobody knew that he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ving morning to talk a little more than anything else , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was the cent@@ ur@@ ion of the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much this means how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to exercise or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to compete .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the trial , stay in the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking for something T@@ oll@@ es to make .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Francon@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was a long time ago at the original sound in an article of the Bavarian Radio .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Francon@@ ia appreciated the purpose of co@@ er@@ ci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; was regarded as exemplary in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was in the association for 31 years , stands behind all this , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , supports about 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 locations and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member churches are the municipalities of Kirch@@ ener , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Bre@@ ed Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , it called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , soil purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , renov@@ ating the high containers ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial re@@ modelling of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and there were always new additions , because water is irrig@@ ated and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation , she praised the Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has regularly lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate sen@@ sing before the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia district . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller on his part praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water attend@@ ant and he was a faithful boy@@ friend .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ construction and restructuring of the Bre@@ ed Union . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the pi@@ ping in the high container near Kirch@@ ener on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the towns could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who steps up the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - A man sho@@ ots up to his partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) .
&quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him will openly be punished . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Germany too , because Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.80 meters large , muscular , brown fired and has a bald head . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a couple of years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man has a bald head . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , shall call the 110 . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship state . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the competent police in Lübeck didn &apos;t want to give any information about the ta@@ ster or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a person was killed . &quot;
this is a killing deli@@ ri@@ um .
&quot; we do not say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - L@@ ights for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; the German steel industry , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers , the gases from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption , to ask for the cas@@ hier . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel units , all an E@@ EG lev@@ y is 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ determination .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation was largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our &apos; steel &apos; campaign , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions law , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed off , &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; last year , the situation further exac@@ erb@@ ated the situation when the world &apos;s largest producer land China threw heavily on the world market in the face of the weaker domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel corporations price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation is somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the import duties imposed on import @-@ steel action , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have accumulated . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have been more or less stagn@@ ant . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude in the end also closures of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 86@@ 000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced six percent less crude steel than in the prior @-@ year period , such as the Steel Union Steel Division on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced quantity declined now for the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output . &quot;
&quot; community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors well &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she attended music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing is emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more vivid , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the Deutsche Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors singing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; social and family structures often dis@@ solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to arrange and organize themselves , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot;
&quot; singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; who demands his lungs regularly , does not get too fast from the powder in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal labour association of the sen@@ iors . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening songs from older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence . &quot;
&quot; through song lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ mentally ill people are sin@@ king to long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires a special achievement , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people , who live alone , do not only focus on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and a@@ wo@@ ke beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears there when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can contact the congregation or the Church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors may ask for help in internet research . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover which effect the rowing of k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals has .
&quot; to their surprise , the me@@ owing also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ ch@@ ew of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to k@@ itt@@ ens of k@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in great need as scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical University of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) found out .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ sting of less and strongly arous@@ ed kit@@ es for the males are either not perc@@ ei@@ vable or not of significance , &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cry differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
nine adult males and eight female females were observed in the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were pre @-@ played for a pupp@@ y of babies who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned more quickly to the loud@@ speakers when the calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males beha@@ ved at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women react more sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski grab@@ s with &quot; gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey once again takes place an important football game . &quot;
&quot; in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul for the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the overthrow in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , there will be no hes@@ itation in front of football . &quot;
&quot; against the former St@@ ark@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South Coast living in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ Kü@@ r is to be followers of the minister of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the attempted coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared an end to an end on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split up in trailer and opponent Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working @-@ club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but what the Turks enter in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ prize &quot; Gala , &quot; it will take place again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine designs in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his club . &quot;
&quot; in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the Pre @-@ Round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also come out early in the Europa League . &quot;
in the South per Li@@ g it ran@@ ged only to sixth .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik the year was better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who took the basis for the 14th title with 26 season figures as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ protecting team . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in the case of the political situation in the country , the situation in the country after the coup attempt had not been announced at the AC Florence and was not to return to Bes@@ ik , because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; commented the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Manager F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the storm would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about a third of its annual mil@@ eage estimated at 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have medals of medals at Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the story of D@@ oping continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics Games .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had su@@ ed her starting spot shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , has been stream@@ lined and boo@@ sted mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
it was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scene : she was still standing in the hall with a set smile and prov@@ oked her appearance .
&quot; being firm that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a rush . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more sport@@ s@@ men , who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he had already locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion even runs faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in the number one of the world and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the second @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six month row after it was detected by the medication Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion in 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 has been positively reviewed for the banned voice of stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ ine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic was denied the in@@ gest@@ ed intake and was closed for six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and second World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and closed for 21 months . &quot;
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has been the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( ham@@ mer@@ ed , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes have been detected as many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to hand over Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the also recognised bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was returned due to a judgment of the International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 @-@ year @-@ old World Championship , indications of taking a banned food supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ de and ran off on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austri@@ as hurt - Multiple T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stands in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday . &quot;
&quot; she suffered grave wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
they planned their home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he , Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so swift . &quot;
&quot; at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok located Hu@@ a H@@ in , two bombs explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life . &quot;
&quot; according to police , a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning two explosive sets went up again , and another person was killed by the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police data . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower bed , the spr@@ inkl@@ er had gone into the air in front of the Re@@ vier of the coast police . &quot;
&quot; finally , even det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ err@@ on on the south @-@ east coast were demanding several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; &quot; said Ar@@ med army Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it was too early to express itself to possible motives , but probably it was a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only a local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bombs were put on by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence of im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still be unclear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police have instruc@@ ted their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in there is a palace , which was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; according to the well @-@ known bombing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , on its homepage , recommends to follow the instructions of Thai security agencies . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need for travelling to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; said Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha , the bombs were an attempt to steal chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ tains itself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost a year ago , in Bangkok , an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine had been killed by 20 people - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identity @-@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; &quot; is out into the Federal Office &apos;s visor for constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; after several regional offices , the constitution conserv@@ ation@@ ists have also made the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see the &apos; identified movement &apos; indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; said Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in this way , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it is opposed to &quot; Mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ temberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; identified . &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities during the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; try to pick up their target audience where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda is meant to emotion@@ ally appeal to people .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states on contacts of &quot; &quot; identified &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species may only be relevant at a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase of legal rights and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ze said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noted in recent years that there can be illegal structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that further ri@@ gh@@ tist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; vo@@ iced concerns , however , that many of the attacks went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying factor .
&quot; many of the suspic@@ ions in attacks on asylum claims were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which then radic@@ alized by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist tendencies . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
&quot; not always , the Olympics or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot;
this shows the bold performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that it could not be seen in the TV pictures at times . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was chosen .
Hab@@ te was then taken to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite in social networks .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th position of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old takes part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in inferior countries well known .
&quot; because in Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ien most sport@@ s@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nickname made the round .
&quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; ro@@ uble of the wh@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; was fun with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle , playing no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i run for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to face over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle on its own in a run @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old had to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had abandoned their business on Monday at 5 : 30 p.m. and forgotten to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;

Tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ pping election situation not so tight
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking about an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election of the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternate video . &quot;
he then prop@@ elled on holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter if : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with US television channel CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it does not reach for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , it is okay , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; thus he described US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;
post increases trade with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously large .
the Post plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
&quot; in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the mail wants to offer its electric cargo transpor@@ ters on the free market from the coming year .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been examining whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other farms . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ Board Jürgen Ger@@ ard said , there are always inquiries , such as by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will shortly enter into the mass production of the vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ industrial fabri@@ cation , the company plan to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ ard had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long term , a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into tr@@ ams in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
&quot; during an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; two of the det@@ ain@@ ees suffered severe injuries , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to escape their data according to an opposite truck , who drove partly on the drive train . &quot;
the bus came right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade freed the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the city district P@@ ew@@ sum by a bus bus .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to report himself to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter sewage from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.10 Euro ; for Zul@@ te berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the installation in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater fee will then increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a low @-@ rate calculation , the sewage charges in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when appro@@ ving the budget , Kul@@ mb@@ ach was approved for these wast@@ ewater treatment plants . &quot;
&quot; due to legal principles , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to cover the facilities cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial plants from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ te berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Managing Director , Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board , a new calculation of fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period were to be equ@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt founded the grav@@ ating fee increases with relatively small facilities for all three wast@@ ewater facilities with a very low waste water fall , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on necessary repairs . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , during the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation period of all three plants , restructuring and repair costs were not least due to their age of remedi@@ ation and repair costs . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ te berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage system .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dischar@@ ged and the sewage slu@@ dge has to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge has to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the ongoing assistance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that in the three plants , expenses for operation and maintenance are fully reflected in the three plants . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Schmidt added , the market community of great entertainment costs had been spar@@ ed during the se@@ wer systems over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to the view of stone houses , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal sewage @-@ wast@@ ewater association could not be expanded because of defic@@ its . &quot;
Bulgaria falls for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded . &quot;
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 , compared to July 2015 , was -@@ 0.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is un@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its fil@@ ter@@ tool , Snap@@ chat permits around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already bo@@ unded to absur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ concep@@ tions arrive at the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have attracted criticism in which they have been accused of promoting the app black@@ out promoting or promoting white skin as beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t , false teeth and ev@@ ap@@ sed W@@ angen , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; Yellow vision &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indign@@ ation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others refused the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widespread over the photos , that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and the least said unpleasant . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filtering effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the extreme extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling wire .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents in terms of race - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and called for others to do the same . &quot;
she said in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that racial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the employment practices at Snap@@ chat .
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leaders and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or good to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ person the company recently hired a personnel manager who focused on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS intelligence service information , establishes committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to record an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed on site , an inquiry committee of the Congress en@@ acted in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Repub@@ lican Members of the Joint Task Force , Intelligence Committee and the Ar@@ ms of Defense , reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command Intelligence Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors have changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence gathering , typically dra@@ ined by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article cited . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the man@@ ag@@ erial errors in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the 10 @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government sp@@ ik@@ es under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts met . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were re@@ played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are continued .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports is underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee issued their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Com@@ intern , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damages the morality among analysts and &quot; gave excessive little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence of the White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon chief inspec@@ tor , who were taken into custody by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , admitted in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress , while the General inspec@@ tor &apos;s investigations were still in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also noted that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the Intelligence Service and the Defense Department welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful campaign of air under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of divisions of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a piece of how the former government under George W. Bush expected only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government stipul@@ ations that contrary to the statements of the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these provisional oil refin@@ eries had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature due to his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the USA won fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead &quot;
&quot; one day after having fired three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , this knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ches on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will go a little longer from the strong Dutch woman who will lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et in her hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team , began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely torn up the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
&quot; India was without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the level of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and invited the ball to the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the gat@@ eke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , there are the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a rag@@ ing relay between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the guards to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t switch on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a women &apos;s warm with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names that would be broadcast to Prime Time by sponsor@@ ing and well @-@ being TV advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognized : air@@ guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast and may it reign long .
&quot; but if I find humble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it has been so spar@@ sely perceived the last 16 years that many people I &apos;ve inter@@ viewed did not know that it is at all an Olympic Port . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the United States sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ si@@ eve charm , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending pr@@ el@@ ude , but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two types of sport that are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before landing on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympic program , depending on the performance , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in her quest for gold , med@@ alli@@ sts must go further , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but also another ca@@ ver@@ ish goal in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ord . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ directed quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I think of myself when looking at these games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers an resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant aboli@@ tion of time and gravity . &quot;
it is so Zen as the competition at the Olympics can be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the en@@ closures as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the monkey and the objective mascul@@ ine ath@@ lete - as the male US gymn@@ asts have recently proposed to the The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base . &quot;

violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters who demand political changes in Ethiopia bl@@ amed on the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testi@@ fied that tens of demonstr@@ ators were killed during coll@@ isions with the police at gun@@ fights .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it has been one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government struck the country and turned into ever more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people hit the streets and asked fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to the human rights organisations , the response of the government was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses gave assur@@ ances that polic@@ emen were fired on tens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in circulation , videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority now requires a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , particularly in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options apart from prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ eh@@ old in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after an extensive election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , have been forced more or less forced to use tur@@ mo@@ il in recent years and be able to arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of hypo@@ cris@@ y under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have been increasingly common and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government ob@@ stru@@ cts access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians reported that they gathered so to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia mainly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , representing around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence agencies , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death on an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly se@@ duc@@ ed in gaining early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands against elections prot@@ ested , according to statements by analysts , apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts lob@@ bi@@ ed Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty eradi@@ cation . &quot;
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; prot@@ esters interven@@ ed in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , directed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to clearly support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama has founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy on Friday that surro@@ unds his campaign , suggest@@ ing that his repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would not have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his comrades who try to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he did not mean at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump , with regard to the claim on Thursday , insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radiator or Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate wanted nothing of it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism bel@@ lows down on Mr. Tr@@ ump as he tries to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would have suggestions for higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism , when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons E@@ mails , but later he stated &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive and then if necessary clarify &quot; &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in a different way .
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more cor@@ ro@@ sive sound since its survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist announced on Friday showed a big lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics of dist@@ orting his statements or mis@@ understanding his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr Tr@@ umps has brought up his loy@@ alist comrades into the un@@ convenient situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of Tr@@ umps , gave a great deal of effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it h@@ ind legs , completely wrong , and that is why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton acted as an Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaigns of Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being ro@@ cking on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied with him . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , poor &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked with Mr Tr@@ umps ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a sc@@ ented café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have a Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years good coffee served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Shop front . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie business , replacing Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people smoke it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ t and verb now is a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , then it is also a re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ bu@@ ed Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide money for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so ash@@ ine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ ers like cap@@ ers and sour onion .
there are natural tears .
&quot; the café does not serve beer any more , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and regularly visited the club . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee drinking , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addi@@ tive . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ time and faithful customer since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing b@@ agel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing b@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he did not have a gru@@ dge , that the soap business took the old business room . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee in the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ point have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he presented them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ arian wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding onto a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was devast@@ ated by the ground when the café concluded .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the opening of the restaurant and the bri@@ st@@ les felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as g@@ our@@ mets President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es Last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while Zi@@ egel@@ man relates in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Publ@@ ishers , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , sle@@ ek I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter cooked chi@@ pper , this was appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ brot . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that draws the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have put in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years prior to the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served fresh baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country was moving , not to be the land of chocolate . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ Device was just as ten@@ se : mysterious dishes such as bread and asser@@ ole were too basic food , the asser@@ ol@@ le was considered a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ use food resi@@ dues , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , because coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar mix@@ tures were tried out , as a cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had appe@@ aled to taste or even healthy kitchen knowledge . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
&quot; as never before or ever , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 and 1943 - ab@@ stain@@ ed from the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing prescri@@ ptions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household @-@ makers &quot; &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ as like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Square Me@@ al &apos; is a celebration of historic delicacies .
&quot; particularly tasty are the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ myself @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmers &quot; cuisine of his cuisine , he appe@@ aled as the milli@@ on@@ ous man of the world to whom he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x .
he was really alien to reality .
&quot; perhaps President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to use his stomach an ex @-@ stamp . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the how@@ ling of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; when writing the book , the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of w@@ asting food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; brick was remembered , &quot; They really made people sick . &quot;
there was the attack of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe , that President Roosev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , and added that it was a v@@ ow trick to miss a modest recipe . &quot;
&quot; there were no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ter , he said to his wife , &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ bs Attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has now died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60,000 people alive . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life in the game , in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil guard , showing him in a 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a radi@@ ant symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; as a hero , he has never seen himself , said , &quot; &quot; For me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrels of barrels above the Al@@ z@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory distress . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the image his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest ver@@ teb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks have only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , influenced by slow@@ ness , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means for ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist probably assumed a long time , that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie will become stone @-@ old . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know correspon@@ d@@ ingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks .
&quot; their time pent@@ ag@@ rams , as they set up six animals in front of Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen , with one transmitter . &quot;
&quot; prey make this shar@@ k nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may hunt for sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek car@@ c@@ asses which tor@@ ment from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 502 cm was measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the nucleus of the sh@@ arks using the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens appears before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
&quot; therefore , their birth should lie after the early 1960s when atomic weapons are seeking greater amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucleus , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens nucleus , which origin@@ ates from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ hai , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers is even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers have been able to alter the length of an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the multip@@ lication can be evi@@ dently at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
also this should be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no accident . &quot;
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck stuck a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ parag@@ us . &quot;
so they ri@@ pen later - and age slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often very big . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
construction site in a double pack
&quot; in the recent session , the Municipal Council has focused on topics related to construction . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board adopted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after clari@@ fying the real estate , par@@ oc@@ ation and inquiry questions and the applications could be placed on survey@@ ing , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( Section 1 ) for interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au attract young families and elderly sen@@ iors equally .
&quot; the municipal council is expected to inform themselves as soon as it was , about the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to demand further industrial enterprises , coupled with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided not to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ Zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of the state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; therefore , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly prob@@ able that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Rock Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been granted approval in the UK so far . &quot;
this is just the advantage of large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; is expecting 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which un@@ ites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk Council ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg is home to a large fund business , it cuts down as well as Dublin with the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city has easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the Management Consulting Merc@@ er , the city stands on No. 7 , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract additional banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot;
&quot; but London , despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , will remain the most important financial center in Europe , &quot; said the econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; according to figures by Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector worked in London according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in Frankfurt . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. State Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc claims the reimbur@@ sement of legal costs that you have ar@@ isen from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , following the block@@ bu@@ ster medications so@@ val@@ di and har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ l and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when collecting the suit on Thursday , US official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction in costs incurred during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs , which can heal over 90 percent of the patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took care of each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; the U.S. supported troops have rec@@ ap@@ tured full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , a spokes@@ man of the group said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , according to the selection of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently experiencing the city . &quot;
&quot; they delivered more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters as host@@ ages shared by Shar@@ an Dar@@ wish the Man@@ bi@@ j military council shared by the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are currently carrying out clean@@ up work , &quot; he told Reuters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton released her tax declaration on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective taxation rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; ex @-@ Minister Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term of office at the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton released his tax declarations for the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective German tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; it is custom@@ ary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged by law because of this . &quot;

&quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of democr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , a special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions are not complete . &quot;
&quot; revi@@ e@@ wers , including the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal issues related to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump calls for his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she also spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that , during the 1990 &apos;s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , indicating that this could still be the case . &quot;
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that persons paying more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in Om@@ aha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has his seat , tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had just under@@ gone IR@@ S as well , and Tr@@ ump was afraid of voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that they referred to only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings from USD 10@@ 9,000 tax@@ ed . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ man@@ ders ; fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ man@@ des .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ well Foundation , which had the idea already years ago , has intensi@@ fied its promotion along with U.S. natur@@ alists by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and crops without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before , many spe@@ ar have used to defend themselves . &quot;
&quot; Friday is the Day of the World , dedicated to animal protection . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change of their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants out of their fields without damaging the elephant in doing so , &quot; commented the Managing Director of Honey@@ well Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; together with a fire@@ work body , ch@@ ili@@ man@@ der mixed with earth is packed into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ man@@ der into the air . &quot;
a touch is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; one last chance is a ship@@ yard , who sho@@ ots a piece of gold into the air , causing a loud , light explosion . &quot;

&quot; however , the city council now declined unanim@@ ously to submit to the new building of a sales office on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ on , which is currently under construction . &quot;

&quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media crash after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre@@ fix , as Arab guests would have requested an employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; wrote his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel in the country &apos;s country selection list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he got there , &quot; ch@@ art@@ ed him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; he was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a bigger shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big response in the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged promp@@ ts of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another post where the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called &quot; &quot; contemp@@ t &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the quick @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
added that the country code is now added .
police forces Tr@@ än@@ gn@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ raine towards prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , students met with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police deployed tear gas and rubber shells to the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to install rubber shells and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their short@@ com@@ ings on the plans .
&quot; according to the recommendations of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest@@ ants saw Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts jump against the preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters entered the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ sive president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dism@@ issed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , shared the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the main priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent , and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian delegation represented about 3@@ 5,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hoped that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
selected Wit@@ nesses : beverage store in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the retention of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , from the employee of the drink market , were leaving the issu@@ ance of cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share with them . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 m , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the assault , the perpetr@@ ators have to be banned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be fled from the gravel parking place located opposite the parking site with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations at the time ( about 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should be urgently reported by the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : playing and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social @-@ educational day group / social group work of the children &apos;s shelter of the Nag@@ old with their car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers on their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; in the quietly situated Freizei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was accommod@@ ated during the first week of school holidays . &quot;
several full @-@ day trips were on the program .
&quot; on the one hand , it went to Bret@@ ten with a visit to the string z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special kinder@@ garten in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited to jump , swim and pl@@ ank . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared meat such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled . &quot;
&quot; workshops were designed to create beautiful gem@@ s made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and you@@ ths returned satisfied . &quot;
sh@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ stries from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next Romantic journey of all the mini@@ stries in the fores@@ ee@@ able two years , the Round of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a long @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; different pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one decided finally for the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Merc@@ y with the opened gate of mercy on Freiburg Cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 And Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the chambers of the saints , arose . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , priest Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m@@ ages and divided the Pil@@ gri@@ mage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b came by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where there was also a Mun@@ ster of Our Lady standing and thus the pilgrimage route from Münster was taken . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always went on to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stages , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast . &quot;
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after finishing the leg to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , some 500 metres of altitude had to be climbed . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was in the evening a common bar@@ beque on the bathroom .
&quot; after the morning impul@@ s on the fourth pilgri@@ m &apos;s day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; clearly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at Fri@@ bourg in the late afternoon and went through the gate of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God has been thank@@ ed here . &quot;
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Brit@@ on wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rac@@ ed last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after taking place in March at the World Championships in London in spite of the retirement of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as exec@@ ution@@ er .
Ho@@ ys retirement beg@@ ged a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that un@@ folds .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner compet@@ ed in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ings , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der lag behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that hin@@ der in a higher gear to slow down and enable Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an Olympic record in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der announced that he inten@@ tionally dropped off the track after a weak start . &quot;
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , there was no such problem this time . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; It feels like the whole UK &apos;s flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team for the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that has won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ drome . &quot;
with the form Kenn@@ y it &apos;s in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same thing by Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y will take part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometers . &quot;
&quot; they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 at the finish . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; he had fought before the qualification yesterday , when function@@ aries were calling him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow and finished , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ el Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team rely on his strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals .
&quot; after an extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ amas with@@ drew in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex and mop@@ b@@ ings and retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite then that the now legendary reputation GB@@ s , who has reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;

&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand in the game , as the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ish all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the facility . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs at the Al@@ coa area in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed during a closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ effects as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa acquired the Point Henry enam@@ el , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mould with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end 2017 . &quot;
&quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that contracts will contribute to revenue in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it had written down the value of the tre@@ aties in its annual subscription of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; expectation of termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book contracts , the &quot; Al@@ co@@ as skill ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the US company said it had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if there is still an explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the industry &apos;s bad economic conditions before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt shop in Victoria and Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; referring to statements by analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land would consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; should both systems go away from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this verse brought me to cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , scann@@ ed reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z on@@ c@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they have all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the stere@@ ot@@ ee@@ zed plot almost every birthday issue of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a Senate Square at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate in this public@@ ity somehow . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the Vo@@ gue in September , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September edition is the most sal@@ eable edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a volume similar to a tape than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the wal@@ tz 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ star will be so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine ev@@ apor@@ ated before the official announcement .
&quot; women already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Ms J@@ enner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls below the former category , is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat @-@ Video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success is not everyone &apos;s success . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ iled up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ m , it seems to pass by at the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal law centres annually reject 16@@ 0,000 people every year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid stations are reported annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is preparing for the impact of further aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three of five persons - mostly older persons , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ og@@ ations and those who have no means for un@@ just legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already exc@@ essi@@ vely rep@@ uted , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose more than 30 percent of its federal funding . &quot;
the Director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal law centers yiel@@ ded that thousands of people have already been exp@@ elled every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without repe@@ aling the resolution of the Federal Government would be even worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services you need will be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and de@@ pressing debts , families who have been dism@@ issed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ justified - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will sh@@ orten the funding by 30 percent since June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need of Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the general prosec@@ utor and federal jus@@ tices and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these mean short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government fulfilled its commitments to raise funds for legal aid to the national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of det@@ ecting workers
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February directed a fire@@ arm on a staff , while in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment which was submitted on Wednesday at the Landes@@ gericht of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini gave up for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drag@@ ged a gun , placed his right index finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the run in Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; having compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign leadership , Bord@@ ini stated that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he announced in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; issued Bord@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; the indictment only occurred two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate triggered a rebellion , when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and weapons friends - should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and appoint a judge . &quot;
the campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not engage in violence .
ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of duty of care and from Philip due to bodily injury and permanent emotional damage .
l@@ umps pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip did not fail as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; on calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : vote before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , substantial losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished . &quot;
this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 35.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the country with 3 per cent respectively .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer has experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it wasn &apos;t good in the hand either . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite pal@@ p@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes initially , which would date for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone now comes with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can buy devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the former standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was reached . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible using HTML browsers , even if agon@@ izing slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 euro . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the Finn@@ s cell division experienced an unprecedented des@@ aster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft . &quot;
today the market domin@@ ates vendors who came all much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices sold , on Samsung and Apple , alone accounted for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; in addition , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telec@@ oms companies are coming . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the crucial breakthrough on the mass market was just beginning in 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World to introduce the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all easy to use via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; Apple began to win , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the after@@ math . &quot;
&quot; finally , she disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to take the smartphone even off , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Executive Board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring about renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me this was the main attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be accomplished by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; we will create 10,000 new teachers for our local communities alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of extending He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they are also wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion , and a legacy of skills and employment both for the airport and in the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; regarding ad block@@ age &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertisements in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop site would change the enco@@ ding with regard to its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the site is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to deal with new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the present@@ able open source community and the trans@@ duc@@ ers has been in progress since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how anxious indicators for the industry have become .
&quot; according to a study of the last year of Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , the company shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue so that Facebook is getting the investment of such a step as re@@ warding .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would refres@@ h its &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; to control people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the user , this is not a positive experience , so we are planning to address the problem , &quot; he shared a message from Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we have focused instead on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to get more control over people &apos;s hands . &quot;
woman in case of supposed suicide on the Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police inv@@ okes witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday when suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman in the age of 49 , who was transferred by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian walking in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer of the neg@@ ligent killing was acqu@@ itted after having crossed a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was un@@ conscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- responding to an emergency call -- was justified in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhabited . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have detected similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere yet slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected against rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the simulation model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its tag@@ ine of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cool than those of the earth today .
&quot; the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that previously had been suspected of planetary scientists . &quot;
&quot; although it was once probably inhabited , Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
the oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by the ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen@@ esis , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy played back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately seek a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I had thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations need to be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination with decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot;
&quot; in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference for five points . &quot;
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers again take talks , set strikes from &quot;
&quot; labour disputes relating to wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the dispute parties sit for a new round of discussion , negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the Wood @-@ field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally operated on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; says a joint statement . &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start early next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has short@@ ened the rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent as a result of negative market pressures . &quot;
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that extra cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell fired thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ a re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was strengthened by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;

Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Tel@@ es@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalogue of ro@@ cking rates under the stars of the Star Garden of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star @-@ tree rotate to different rates , and in what context are the rot@@ ational periods with the planet development . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches to peak rot@@ ations .
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star breaks down , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more solid stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , with larger stars revol@@ ving slower Pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massi@@ vely , whereas quicker rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ads is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the stell@@ ar qualities such as ro@@ cking rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is much ahead of us to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the web presses of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star occurs
&quot; with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , the tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days from Base to Base . &quot;
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Y@@ ank@@ ees last time on August 12 against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; good@@ bye &quot; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ times all @-@ star game participants in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ees . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was paying back for a long time . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 , he made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be accepted into the bas@@ eball hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star appeared at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have taken banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have been receiving performance @-@ promoting agents for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time addic@@ ted . &quot;
even his farewell days were not lost no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legend played the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Y@@ ank@@ ees Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and with the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got to be told , sympathy @-@ con@@ und@@ ations of the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ riv@@ al Boston red so@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing probe , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official events .
a well @-@ known ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official events of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro have become known . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - right before the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions , these messages arrive at the time . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated that is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Court of Appe@@ als confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the pen@@ alties over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing has been applied . &quot;
&quot; the national association adop@@ ts the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CAS and will accept the judgement . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio the news about the positive rehear@@ sal took place at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the banned substance will deal with the blood @-@ dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should already have a positive effect . &quot;
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov reported immediately with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why sport@@ s@@ men don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; in this way , approximately all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg has been tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation banned the complete Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing , but also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the former tre@@ aties in China also ensured fierce battles between athletes . &quot;
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang , pink purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Sun stood at the heart of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on . &quot;
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested in 2014 by the Chinese champ@@ ionships for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three month row . &quot;
data Cl@@ ose : so per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ ress h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .

40 per cent of the victims will@@ ingly paid the solutions demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ b on attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially high @-@ pressure ran@@ som is much higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ b boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fresh@@ fields Bru@@ ckhaus Der@@ inger Firm of the Year for In@@ solv@@ ency Administration Schneider Gei@@ witz &amp; Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Glei@@ ss Lutz
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered the black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks happened quickly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the victim &apos;s computer , it is targeted for un@@ modified files such as word@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als permanently .
&quot; after that , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the German companies reported revenue losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operation , in case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , many hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be acute threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stagn@@ ation in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user @-@ occupied areas and contact with the black@@ posts and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to gain more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , create freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate hard and pay five dig@@ its to recover their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of potentially high and relatively low risk gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ewski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers res@@ ell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the existing malware kits have been created by providing users with malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log@@ ically log in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set by a criminal and mand@@ ates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected host .
&quot; usually the criminals occupy sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known by many companies that better safeguard their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust Ran@@ som@@ ware to be able to aver@@ t through file back @-@ ups and scann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful yields , the perpetr@@ ators are threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ b chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; depending on the type of data , the damage potential is still much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators will be able to take full new targets on the Internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; on the Def@@ con dul@@ c@@ imer conference , security researchers demonstrated how to control a connected thermo@@ stat with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V appears rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well processed and are pleasant , only the cock@@ pit side of the interior falls apart . &quot;
&quot; more versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is in the storage box . &quot;
&quot; it is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l of high @-@ featured and 10@@ 26 l back@@ rests available , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie armchair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded easily , however the loading height with 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , his work should be somewhat qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 l gasoline with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security system is part of the City @-@ emergency braking system ( working at speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane support assistant . &quot;
the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because in the maneu@@ vering many obstacles are rated as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent cruise control respon@@ ds to the sign@@ age detection and th@@ rot@@ tle if necessary the speed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI connector are available under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel starting from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger lift
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger lift .
&quot; liability is only possible in case of dangers , which are typical of air traffic , argued the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken the knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a matter of general life risk , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of sickness : when does the organis@@ er pay ?
&quot; after their journey , dise@@ ased holiday@@ makers only get money back if the cause of the illness is to be found without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten per cent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the case , a family had severely reduced diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their holiday . &quot;
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
&quot; their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a faul@@ ty sewage plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
&quot; the family was the view , the trip was thus flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er . &quot;
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot;
but the organizer just got out of it shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since there were no contam@@ in@@ ants found in the samples of water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ acting one another - belongs to the general life risk .
there were only 38 guests of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , had many people worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must ins@@ ist and decis@@ i@@ vely react to terrorist threats .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and sch@@ ism . &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if criminal off@@ ences would have to leave the country more quickly , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement proposals until 2017 .
&quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; in a medium @-@ term order of magnitude over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be under penalty . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire will be amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons in the internet will be difficult . &quot;
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should remain intact after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions , how the threat of the citizen can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister is keeping a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers must be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ ati@@ sed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly expressed himself against action .
&quot; this was an ear@@ sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship .
&quot; as a general prohibition of all @-@ obsc@@ ure , he believes that he is constitu@@ tionally problematic . &quot;
you can &apos;t prohi@@ bit anything you refuse and I rest wearing the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green @-@ Chief Simone Peter rejected the minister who wanted to simul@@ ate Tat@@ power and maneu@@ ver@@ ability with the new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger left @-@ hand partner said : &quot; &quot; fleet of Pro@@ verbs and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the right to stay bring people no more safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway brid@@ ging
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture from November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal remedy is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient road every night in the traffic jam , when driving over the highway , Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the road construction industry extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the departure Wes@@ eler Straße the right bending lane by 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then drive directly from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic spl@@ its early , whereby the total flow of traffic on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 will be improved . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U fraction in the district , &quot; &quot; Münster @-@ West &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the train station anno@@ ys drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return journey reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h way and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
reason is the needle clock on the B 51 shortly before departure Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , the traffic is only guided one @-@ lane over the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second lane had to be built back to a good three @-@ four@@ ths years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity , in order to accommodate the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected @-@ day traffic jam will last , the competent state company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining lifetime until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the right @-@ hand bend , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the road @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected . &quot;
traffic is passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday one lane on the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a musical project .
the N@@ ima &apos;s Association enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; , &quot; 19 students between 11 and 15 years of age visited the staging in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migrant and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and we@@ aken little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scen@@ ographic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professional guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language education are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for better weather
&quot; the weather turned out to be a d@@ ash through the bill in the south @-@ west of Germany in the south @-@ west of Germany , but there is still hope . &quot;
&quot; the night was poor@@ ly suited for clouds and rain , watching the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ nings . &quot;
our hope is on the night for Saturday .

relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , one rolls around forever , at night it is awake for hours , in the morning it is far from the wake of the wake @-@ ring no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ep@@ sy and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an input and sleeping disorder . &quot;
&quot; just sleeping , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medications . &quot;
in@@ frequently the in@@ som@@ nia is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early aw@@ aking is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
&quot; for example , who has a disc fraud , can lie poor@@ ly , w@@ akes up every two or three hours and possibly starts to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
from when should people with sleep disorders go to the doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is imp@@ aired in the day should go to the doctor &apos;s av@@ ail .
&quot; impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is tired , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; there are hardly any medical practitioners in Germany , acc@@ entu@@ ated by Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of problems , you should first contact the veter@@ inary surgeon , advis@@ es We@@ eks . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for the examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise for example snor@@ ing with breathing apparatus , in case of sick day @-@ fatigue , in case of dor@@ man@@ t or when one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the disgu@@ sting one goes to bed at its normal time .
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera cap@@ tures the sleeping end at the ceiling . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers manage the problems ?
&quot; there are quite a lot of adjusting screws , where you can set for a better sleep . &quot;
&quot; it counts on : regular sleeping and stopping times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , alcohol , and at night don &apos;t look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to swim with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing end of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he obtained gold for the first time at the Ring World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler , via Facebook , protected himself from his ex @-@ team @-@ mates who have been critic@@ ised in the criticism . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle King € 15@@ 0.000 , nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the transport system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who do not have a certain amount of time before WM / OS controlled by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot;
airport : ban@@ de taken from Lu@@ gg@@ age Li@@ fts
professional th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; Wednesday , 18.@@ February@@ 2016 You are not logged in ... &#91; Log In &#93; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage ste@@ els as ban@@ de .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials from Düsseldorf airport identified a gang that was known to police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were collec@@ tively , work@@ able and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can prove four actions to the th@@ iev@@ es , which were submitted to Germany specifically for the sake of criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; they had exploited a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , meanwhile a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in doesn &apos;t look like this at first glance , but the police are among the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; at the facade of a grey house , someone is &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be dem@@ ol@@ ished also soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , will be illustrated in the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the house is number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the occup@@ ants have lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin In@@ sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has spoken repeatedly for a tough action by the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; No @-@ Go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were disp@@ elled with 300 police officers , according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew car@@ riages on site , shut off parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the building worker commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved from sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others conver@@ se before late Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main source of many local residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who plays three children here , is mainly generated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; , &quot; who wants to call itself police protection against the most sc@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between house @-@ occup@@ ants and their neighbours make up , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the East of Berlin , Friedrich@@ sha@@ in was a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all the Main@@ zer street near the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga , and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and Berlin@@ ers from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on raised discs or newly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown with color bags .
no other road was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : criminal off@@ ences , such as bodily injury , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the off@@ ences make material damage , which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant near the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is appe@@ ti@@ zing : the people in 94 are their neighbors , that have not been this . &quot;
&quot; the famous burning cars , too , don &apos;t give it any longer directly in Riga . &quot;
&quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal background , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and stayed .
&quot; that &apos;s why it was also so important to get back to the residents : by the police , politics and the media , which in July everybody suddenly claims the interpretation of the city . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by expos@@ ing new buildings in former buildings , which displ@@ ace the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - people living here are rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can one do if someone never hears it ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for zo@@ oms that anno@@ y themselves about colour bombs : the skin projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who is pulling , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub , can badly complain about noise there . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ in supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities , and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group points out that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the cleansing wool @-@ l@@ actic acid , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridicul@@ ously than rather pointed to the multitude of fields of application - meant , as the administration wanted to write the passage . &quot;
&quot; an administrative expert was sought with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work . &quot;
&quot; administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
new containers at W@@ as@@ enstraße will soon be available
&quot; for some time , a serious problem has been to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized . &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the provision of the connection .
they have to accommodate refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must bear the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Council Office to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work so far as you depend on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be inv@@ ali@@ dated , as it is called so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are installed in the W@@ as@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ am@@ aged or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as told by Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , activity does not only mean a job . &quot;
&quot; the tag needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people need to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so , we need offers such as sports , contacts with local people and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , there are also administration and volunteers . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make time wis@@ er , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are also problem cases , says Customer hon@@ estly , &quot; People who do nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others . &quot;
&quot; all this is a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two after the latest events fear radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would bring them completely in retri@@ bution .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main and volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new coll@@ ision could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics det@@ ests itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer , too , makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is also already busy to integrate the existing people wis@@ ely . &quot;
&quot; these are currently about 100 persons , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ary with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter ran for about one hour different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am on Friday morning .
the inhabitants were surprised by the two and hit the un@@ hol@@ den in their flight .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.70 m tall , probably m@@ asked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled to the city centre .
&quot; for flag@@ ging , the police set several strips of strip and a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag@@ ging ran without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown was , in fact , close to the apartment or at their escape . &quot;
