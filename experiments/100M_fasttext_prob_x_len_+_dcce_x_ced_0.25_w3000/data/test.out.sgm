<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer experimented with some colleagues a little change with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">"CHIO:" "golden Sportpyramid" "for Bernhard Langer"</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses recalled their holidays, they went home to the feed troughs after a quick gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the mount-career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let his family run over the ALRV site, and he didn't even dare to take pictures for a horse."</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the first time in Aachen and therewith also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite impressive.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports assistance handed the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Goldene Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes bay leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adjured him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize-winner of the Sport Pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first laureate Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot," says Langer, "because she is not only awarded for athletic achievements, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros as well."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the second-time U.S. Mastersner was admitted to the" Hall of Fame of the German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the real Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Pumps economic policy compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade deal TTP - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US Presidential candidates are unequal in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">That is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep the case rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to taxies the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserted Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively lag behind regulations, and he will be strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would be increased for the rich, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost identical."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-owned tea party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, so even party discussions could come."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to announce the climate protection treaty in Paris."</seg>
<seg id="20">"on the other hand, with its investment program, Clinton explicitly wants to extend and claim the renewable energies:" a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the United States do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should then be paid better, demands about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage does not have to be changed, he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands trump, which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point to him so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously into the room with great eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene appears normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is managing director of Condrobs, a provider of social services in Bavaria and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for all-minded women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs established the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Help Centre."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not have any - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten the torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a ray of hope," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="24">"women predominate other reasons for the escape:" "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced observation, honor killing, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for instance demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and at worst abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that about 90 per cent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatised, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since she often doesn't want to help, it requires more accommodations only for her, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction, some reply with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Swabia alone, winged women are not stored separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central lodgings only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published by the Committee, it is said:" "it is very important that men and women will be accommodated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing or if men and women are lodged together, it may be - perpetual violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as much as women feel this need of protection, one can read the crowds using the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around that there is us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">One could easily arrange a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant veterinaries have called upon their union to approve new employment campaigns in their dispute concerning a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more labour measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that the ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistants and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members, which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" persistently quiet "had problems, which resulted in the contract being rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "in view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for official new negotiations to all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC committee today provided a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating labour campaigns that began in early September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the disputes led to the fact that the veterinarians discussed six times this year, the first total outages in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the BMA Assistant Dr. Johann Malawana, after the election, came back to the rejection of the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BMA."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight months war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gold-gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't refuse the impression that Ankara will most want this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile was greedy and he hardly radiated warmth, even for its restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustained cooling showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words: the downturn of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was flooded.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the offence was even greater, as it was committed by a presumed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the etracker again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited his own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemence.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdogan that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been enthroned by his ministry last month with a failed coup d'état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-meshed onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecast for cheap fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry on the West, as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "the ongoing resentment on the snail rate of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is piping out to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian leader won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d'état."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, as an analyst once described," "Alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that drive away from the West and are badly treated and now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both presidents at the press conference said they had not even stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentionally left it on a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey discovers the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="5">"in a statement by the Kremlin it is that, without giving reasons," "the discharge of Ivanovs ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Anton Vaino, who has been representing Ivanov's prostitute since 2012, was appointed to his successor."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin website, it is said (in Russian) that he later was the chief executive and chief executive of the government personnel."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding legislative proposals and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post, and Vaino recommended his successor."</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time and works as he is for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff recedes at his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smiles for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">"so, is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?"</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man, who once was once touted as a potential president, at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, said Ivanov," it is true that I asked you early 2012 in a conversation, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to confidently entrust for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia since a third term of Putin would violate the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north-deck of Queensferry Crossings to the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling blowers" "that are approaching completion for each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first, who went from the country to the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of truly epic proportions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last block of the road and its connection with the North turmdeck installed in the expansion, we then had to close the existing gap on the north or west side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern accommodation bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by approximately 3%."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building cheap apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens think: investors should be put into duty much more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that in the next few years Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 budget apartments?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD invites a" "Action Concept Living" "at the next meeting of the council."</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A settlement is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD leader Christoph Bratmann believes:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, will in future need to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the affordable apartments can also be built in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the big dispute in the Town Hall is, however, so Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors in such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the flats as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing loan program, which will cost millions of money and needs to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite the so-called Bratman, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is increasing."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the scope of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how does one compare the loss of more around 1300 low-priced apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the planning policy maker Nicole Palm should now be acquitted from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring flats back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western town there are periods of time for the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be picked up there in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this does not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the West Bank is increased drastically again, one removes oneself from the objective of so-called intermingling."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social welfare in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect there will be even more movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group leader Holger Herlitschke believes:" "for a vast majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I concentrated on more constructions for single-family homes.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as many phenomena of pop culture fell the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and once they have been found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which the" average "person puts back every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app, followed by 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of downstream people who exercise 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - only the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take 30 minutes to" come out of the sofa "and" to be active "every day," bumped on deaf ears because many public messages are boring and people come to look miserable. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"whoever is driving sports regularly, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships at the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also metric game spoilers that always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people hunting, active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and, in total, the fifth as she solidifies her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success makes them in the same league as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="17">"it expected her a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between the picture and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze was in a tiebrake at Mustafa."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time the 22-year-old man captain, who is called" "Oma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after their ground practice, she cast into the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I've been there for every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, who is Katholikin, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas had been a surprising Olympic champion and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful Gymastikroutinen."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we are experiencing the top of this sport, but so do not see gyms in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics are expensive sports and gymnasts in the first place in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents, who pay for the training, training, travel, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these vertebrates lie in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the municipalities the countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"during my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international champions."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>

<seg id="11">"this not only serves for election fraud, but also aims to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial crisis that is associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman should be given to corrupt and illegal practice of his office after a litany."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman should" "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>

<seg id="3">"in order to worsen the situation, she looked at how she looked at it, pulled her off and put her back to the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">She moved on and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the Primark Shop in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, in which the woman tried the underpants before she put her back into the shelf"</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried underwear, she came back and left the business without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: "people couldn't believe what they saw.</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the tray, she took a pair of underpants from the top, pulled her own tights and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a somewhat discrete place to do it - she simply stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when they pulled off the underpants, who obviously didn't like them, as they put them back to the shelf again."</seg>
<seg id="11">She repeated the same with three more underpants before she finally decided she didn't like to go back and out.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she did not seem to disturb her that she was observing someone - or thinking about the person who, under certain circumstances, would buy the underpants she had tried."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent said:" "how reluctantly to think someone would take shelter with home who had a different person and who were not washed."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Ms. Davidson added:" "as I got along, people tried to draw clothing out of sale after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate it to go home with a new couple of underpants and find out that another woman had dressed her and went out and they were not washed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a spokesman for Primark said:" "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 in our branch in Folkstone."</seg>
<seg id="18">All products in question have been drawn from the sale.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com might make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of Krav Maga Verband in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you approach you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the firing line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"hit it with the knee in the bar and spin, while the attacker is clinging together before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and twist it, so that the attacker can not shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on him."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a guidebook his tongue at the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and thrombosis of a serious test - filling some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk dropped his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a railing head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaking up any object, he used a Luminometer to show up and to show us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickey's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to light."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leasing the sink head of a train toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately nothing left what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his bowels, travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railings to train stations to flushing knobs of toilets, the task set his immune system definitively under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film, he said:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to live up to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample showed a Luminometer of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometer number of fresh-washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leak after their Luminometer was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickey's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "this comes close to the worst I have in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickey's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call Ian to Ian.</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film director, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to leak them and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by valio from 2015 84 percent of all respondents studied lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had flesy holes, wooden planks were ripped, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated at the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think that people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwalls.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is infamous and their reputation is too.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball bat, intimidations of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and flukes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeleton, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"they were in the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks are ripped."</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called to call the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing has delogged her and her partner this week by forcible the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">Delogation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They didn't care for anybody." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today we could not sleep." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had foamed the family to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down"</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family as a delogation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously agreed on us and have given us the information provided."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in the house administration will now have to incinerate garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernies and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon got a fine after having found guilty of ownership of a class B drug in trade.</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 during a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were labeled with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will delogging tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"by the police of Devon and Cornwall, Angela Crow said that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the rules of the house."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour," "she said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"who doesn't suit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-approaching Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish congregation of Germany counts on short notice with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term it could even be" "several hundred thousand", "the president of the association Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh front of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish congregation of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand protection-seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime combats the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president Ali Toprak of the "world" from Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had left Kurdish strongholds with penalties a few months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the secret putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that absorbs refugees, produced refugees in their own country, said Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Association of Representatives complained the deliberate settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kurdish, but also in cities of Albany."</seg>
<seg id="12">"with this, Erdogan wants to raise the outcry pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," Toprak, who is also the CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The chief officer called for the Federal Government to be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not vote the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"since idiotic than so far, it is not: summer holidays, heat and land ground combat - that bites up."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the champions, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most vacationers, who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so may not choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"to do so, practical problems come: during the holidays, helpers who hang on posters, inflating balloons, distributing flyers, and counting on the end of the vote, only work with difficulty."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again been forced to pass a campaign close to the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly new AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition times.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign for election."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributing roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has cold feet and chancellor Merkel gives Merkel the blame on the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy," "We are creating that" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it's when you are at the right place at the right place at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to show her the German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not vote, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but it is too bad to anybody from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel can listen."</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely eliminates the usual election campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the country the base is brittle, that it must be very stringent, to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it goes on like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the vast expanse of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU-Elector Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing:" they must go where it is, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because much is on the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just shortly before AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the country day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and put their campaign largely into the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign," says the president Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green pollutes go on track search for local stimulation with tourists."</seg>
<seg id="35">"if you want to learn more about this topic, please do not hesitate to contact us."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those who are responsible for construction work, which begin at 5.30am and only end at the age of 20, there is praise everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything quite cheaply," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the weekend, until the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the reciprocity of those responsible for construction works is also vowed, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift drives."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was emigrated on Monday to the south and also the locking of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been cancelled, and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now go back on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>

<seg id="12">"there were some significant complaints," says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for traffic engineering. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creeping paths were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the signage."</seg>

<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not met, the community called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>

<seg id="18">The quickest was on the road with 77 km / h in the Tempo-30-zone.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>

<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been fired, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now it also has to bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÖHNER knows from other country circles, where so much more funding has been handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all passages, Göhner is sure his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he points to the long history."</seg>

<seg id="8">"other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"well, I took part in this."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but as Minister of the Interior, however, he was situated on results and at a" "achievable consensus" "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière submitted a little bit of time before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"quite well-known, announced, announced, that a new security authority to deal with the crisp communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on passenger information and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for safety authorities is also not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="17">"that will be difficult points for the SPD," explains the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he still maintains that for reasonable and demanding nothing, which in the case of the coalitionist anyway has no chances."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented de Maizière too.</seg>

<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a safety check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in cases of negations for expired asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately cast their papers in order to disguise their identity."</seg>

<seg id="24">Some people still have an unpleasant effect and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the unequal treatment of patiently for example, the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that were deeply devoted to human beings did not cling to election times.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who does buy vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lent men of middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before committing to the comment section, to sow it under the pseudonym Non-Allemonene Men's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much discussed re-emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely breed group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of yougov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wild grazing before I stand, holding my hands and a certain level of determining how:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic board specialty stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I originate from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle aged men) into Reckless Records (numbers: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 boards."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these vinyl records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and bought items which he sold when he was young and ready."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I was probably something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, who he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and see to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have conducted, people usually get rid of their collection in the same way around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom in followers of the record-revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar soundtrack sleeves, from items that awaken lucky charm."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessions of material possessions than a kind of consolation," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "a staff buttoned out of a stack of tiles."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy one record, do not have turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I was puzzled by a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (quantity: three middle-aged men) has noticed a trophy aspect of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently and said:" I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more provocative, less musically."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who only slowly enter."</seg>
<seg id="44">"opp, which has dedicated the record almost a whole floor, has a blower audience than I enter."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops, Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer- and sexist Pop instead of experimental jazz drenurs out of the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strangely lonely, but nagging mental traumas are hard to fix when standing next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a shopping basket as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." she drives away with a distorted sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the impression to sample the jeans-Hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research showed that the results of YouGov votes, they, at least in record shops in Soho, have not taken into account the large number of female collectors and turntables that exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning surely not talking about plates from the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who overlooks the shoulders of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a trial this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down, because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which bear a fire and Sanity risk."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups, would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also realized that the provisional businesses and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely nourishing people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer calm matches between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in a community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of migrants in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji granted a master class in handling, side-stepping, drawbacks, scheduled flight and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any colour."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was lost due to the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the form of this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for UK - but it probably won't - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">"here, they only lost one."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji was stunned and caused the attacks of GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with just four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner that he transformed."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a hysterous Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, Veremalua takes a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still cores."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes which was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran long in favor of the South Sea sultanans, whose fans sang, flags flew and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliam put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the whistle sounded, the fijis embraced and GB kicked crushing in the lawn."</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day Fiji Japan had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a close half-finalmatch from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a door among the posts in the second half."</seg>
<seg id="30">"a brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal."</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotive gold than those games and that wants what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">"from the first rudder to the last, 220 hard pieve which enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when she strove to the second Olympiagold in the second place without a tax wife, the first women in the history of British sports who laid such a benchmark."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolute, after all their 39.000 undisputed use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the way of triumph to geze."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that make the difference, and nobody knew that he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he was risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do this, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had good luck that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerving morning to talk a little more than anything else, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was the centurion of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much this means how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I wouldn't have wished for a better person to exercise or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the trial, stay in the trial." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking for something Tolles to make.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want fireworks, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have been too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion."</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="15">"as outstanding events, it called the start-up and inauguration of the new wells (1994), soil purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, renovating the high containers (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial remodelling of water pipes."</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the German steel industry, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers, the gases from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption, to ask for the cashier."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel units, all an EEG levy is 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="12">"thus, the status quo of the previous regulation was largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our 'steel' campaign, this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of emissions law, climate and employment targets are to be weighed off," "explained IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation further exacerbated the situation when the world's largest producer land China threw heavily on the world market in the face of the weaker domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel corporations price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation is somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, the import duties imposed on import-steel action, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have accumulated."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have been more or less stagnant."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude in the end also closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of 2015, around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced six percent less crude steel than in the prior-year period, such as the Steel Union Steel Division on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the produced quantity declined now for the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production is two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, mind, health: singing does seniors well"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she attended music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing is emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more vivid, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the Deutsche Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors singing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir:" to arrange and organize themselves, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration."</seg>
<seg id="13">"who demands his lungs regularly, does not get too fast from the powder in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the federal labour association of the seniors."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening songs from older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through song lyrics and especially melodies, self-mentally ill people are sinking to long-lying events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires a special achievement, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on one's own voice and a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people, who live alone, do not only focus on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and awoke beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears there when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastic choir can contact the congregation or the Church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors may ask for help in internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous examination, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens-cry differed with the urgency of their dependency."</seg>

<seg id="11">They were pre-played for a puppy of babies who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>

<seg id="15">They turned more quickly to the loudspeakers when the calls of the very excited kittens played off.</seg>

<seg id="8">"according to police, a Thai change was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the bombings bear the same signature," "said Armed army Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists."</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it was too early to express itself to possible motives, but probably it was a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist insurgency movement or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only a local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, one assumes that the bombs were put on by opponents of the ruling military junta."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities would have kept secret evidence of impending attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">"still be unclear, which group behind the attacks."</seg>

<seg id="27">"in Hua Hin there is a palace, which was used over the years of Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej."</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) paid for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"said Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, the bombs were an attempt to steal chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, retains itself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the installation in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will then increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after a low-rate calculation, the sewage charges in Azendorf will then be at 4,37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when approving the budget, Kulmbach was approved for these wastewater treatment plants."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal principles, the Kasendorf market is obliged to cover the facilities cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial plants from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zulte berg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Managing Director, Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a new calculation of fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period were to be equated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt founded the gravating fee increases with relatively small facilities for all three wastewater facilities with a very low waste water fall, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on necessary repairs."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, during the recuperation period of all three plants, restructuring and repair costs were not least due to their age of remediation and repair costs."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zulte berg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf sewage system.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be discharged and the sewage sludge has to be disposed of, the sewage sludge has to be disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "these extraordinary expenses came from the ongoing assistance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were still below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">"stone houses made it clear that in the three plants, expenses for operation and maintenance are fully reflected in the three plants."</seg>
<seg id="20">"as a result, Schmidt added, the market community of great entertainment costs had been spared during the sewer systems over the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"according to the view of stone houses, the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be precarious, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage-wastewater association could not be expanded because of deficits."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtertool, Snapchat permits around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that is already bounded to absurde."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are blunt, self-propelled tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All misconceptions arrive at the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in which they have been accused of promoting the app blackout promoting or promoting white skin as beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit, false teeth and evapsed Wangen, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians -" "Yellow vision". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurting clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widespread over the photos, that the filter was" hurtful and the least said unpleasant. ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the contrast of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filtering effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the extreme extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents in terms of race - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"if one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user," "it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and called for others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">She said in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the employment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the big part white, only male leaders and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or good to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that the Snapchat has largely left unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to record an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions were allowed on site, an inquiry committee of the Congress enacted in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Joint Task Force, Intelligence Committee and the Arms of Defense, reports of great discontent under Central Command Intelligence Service analysts who reported how superiors have changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering, typically drained by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site were allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," a newspaper article cited. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The managerial errors in the CentCom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their superiors, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts met." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom was publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tops of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were replayed that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports is underway by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee issued their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking Demokrat in the Comintern, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, as Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "damages the morality among analysts and" gave excessive little space for different opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no evidence of the White House intervention in the CentCom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon chief inspector, who were taken into custody by CentCom analyst."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, admitted in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress, while the General inspector's investigations were still in progress."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also noted that" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the Intelligence Service and the Defense Department welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful campaign of air under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the allegations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of divisions of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a piece of how the former government under George W. Bush expected only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker according to government stipulations that contrary to the statements of the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these provisional oil refineries had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature due to his excessive positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will go a little longer from the strong Dutch woman who will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008 as she could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team, began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely torn up the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the level of 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and invited the ball to the gate to get the American female a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the gatekeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Same as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is, there are the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a raging relay between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the guards to the gymnast to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't switch on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a women's warm with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names that would be broadcast to Prime Time by sponsoring and well-being TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting for gold in the olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized: airguns, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I find humble arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived the last 16 years that many people I've interviewed did not know that it is at all an Olympic Port."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the United States sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsieve charm, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending prelude, but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two types of sport that are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are evaluated according to the official Olympic program, depending on the performance, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in her quest for gold, medallists must go further, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but also another caverish goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympiarord."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-directed quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I think of myself when looking at these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prallt, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the competition at the Olympics can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the enclosures as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the monkey and the objective masculine athlete - as the male US gymnasts have recently proposed to the The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA"</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters who demand political changes in Ethiopia blamed on the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that tens of demonstrators were killed during collisions with the police at gunfights.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government struck the country and turned into ever more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people hit the streets and asked fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to the human rights organisations, the response of the government was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave assurances that policemen were fired on tens of unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now requires a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, particularly in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options apart from protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after an extensive election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, have been forced more or less forced to use turmoil in recent years and be able to arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of hypocrisy under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have been increasingly common and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government obstructs access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians reported that they gathered so to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, representing around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence agencies, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on an unpublicized disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly seduced in gaining early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections protested, according to statements by analysts, apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts lobbied Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty eradication."</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"protesters intervened in Gondar, an amharan city, directed by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to clearly support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has founded ISIS "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign, suggesting that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings together his comrades who try to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he did not mean at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump, with regard to the claim on Thursday, insisted that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said, he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the contrast to the previous day where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radiator or Hugh Hewitt wanted Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing of it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism bellows down on Mr. Trump as he tries to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would have suggestions for higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism, when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clintons Emails, but later he stated" Of course I thought the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive and then if necessary clarify" "according to what the reaction falls." "said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive sound since its survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist announced on Friday showed a big lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he emphasises the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr Trumps has brought up his loyalist comrades into the unconvenient situation to face him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of Trumps, gave a great deal of effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about Mr. Trumps's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it hind legs, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton acted as an Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaigns of Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being rocking on each of his words and being preoccupied with him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the" poor, poor "television experts who try to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked with Mr Trumps apology as only a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="3">As gourmets President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicatessen of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on this day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs Last book" "Chop Suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while Ziegelman relates in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper Publishers, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, sleek Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetables."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter cooked chipper, this was appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, Leberkäse and Bohnenbrot."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper that draws the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have put in the stomach like lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years prior to the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served fresh baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "records the ways with which the country was moving, not to be the land of chocolate."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense topic," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new BudgetdiDevice was just as tense: mysterious dishes such as bread and asserole were too basic food, the asserolle was considered a" wonderful way to reuse food residues, "Brickman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar mixtures were tried out, as a calorie and nutritious satisfaction had appealed to taste or even healthy kitchen knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, too."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Ziegelmann continues:" "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or ever, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, between 1923 and 1943 - abstained from the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "household-makers" "and the challenge to transform pampas like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals."</seg>
<seg id="34">'A Square Meal 'is a celebration of historic delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">"particularly tasty are the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-myself-cake-food-attitude."</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmers" cuisine of his cuisine, he appealed as the millionous man of the world to whom he became. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tux.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was really alien to reality.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks have only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland-shark swims along at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates up to 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, influenced by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist probably assumed a long time, that Greenland-haie will become stone-old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time pentagrams, as they set up six animals in front of Spitsbergen, with one transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"prey make this shark nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt for sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek carcasses which torment from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 cm was measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens appears before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should lie after the early 1960s when atomic weapons are seeking greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens nucleus, which originates from cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland-hai, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-hai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers have been able to alter the length of an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication can be evidently at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this should be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusales live mainly in icy waters, is no accident."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland wal, in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they ripen later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible," "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein."</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team Sprint Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage, who had made his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking place in March at the World Championships in London in spite of the retirement of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as executioner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement begged a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner competed in the qualifying rounds, but in the standings, the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder lag behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that hinder in a higher gear to slow down and enable Kenny and above all skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic record in the Endrunde and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 at the site Kenny and Hoys, Hinder announced that he intentionally dropped off the track after a weak start."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," It feels like the whole UK's flags on the tribune like London. "</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team for the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation that has won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it's in the realm of possible that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same thing by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will go for three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "I enjoy this just for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hinder said:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal race of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometers."</seg>
<seg id="39">"they arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish."</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had fought before the qualification yesterday, when functionaries were calling him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow and finished, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team rely on his strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after an extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in the background, Dramas withdrew in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sex and mopbings and retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, when you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks quite then that the now legendary reputation GBs, who has reached its climax at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand in the game, as the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thereby abolish all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the facility."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at the Alcoa area in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be jeopardized during a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to Dominoeffects as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014 Alcoa acquired the Point Henry enamel, which led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium mould with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp will hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"from this point, AGL assumes that contracts will contribute to revenue in the fiscal year 17," said the power supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it had written down the value of the treaties in its annual subscription of $187 million in" "expectation of termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book contracts, the" Alcoas skill... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said it had concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if there is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the industry's bad economic conditions before the possible closure of the Portland melt shop in Victoria and Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"referring to statements by analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland would consume around 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems go away from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generating set, that would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this verse brought me to cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scanned reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz oncels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they have all planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the stereoteezed plot almost every birthday issue of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence," You thought we had forgotten you?, "with the honesty of a cartoon on a Senate Square at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to participate in this publicity somehow."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with a view to the Vogue in September, a new era of the Kardashians began with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most saleable edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="14">"Oscar prize-winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Ms Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls below the former category, is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat-Video (even if it applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of their career."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenner's success is not everyone's success."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the Mistakes of the Moment."</seg>

<seg id="2">"e-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market."</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his producer has experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it wasn't good in the hand either."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite palpable."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was eight megabytes initially, which would date for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone now comes with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can buy devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"however, 20 years ago the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the former standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible using HTML browsers, even if agonizing slow."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the smart phones are a success story, if not for Nokia."</seg>

<seg id="33">"Apple began to win, even today, the iPhone is the most important product of the group."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring about renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me this was the main attraction of Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be accomplished by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"we will create 10,000 new teachers for our local communities alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of extending Heathrows is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wronged in 2012 and they are also wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion, and a legacy of skills and employment both for the airport and in the whole of the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have implemented a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented walkways in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabited."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have detected similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere yet slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the simulation model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its tagine of the Sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cool than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that previously had been suspected of planetary scientists."</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once probably inhabited, Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years."</seg>
<seg id="15">The oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogenesis, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather the most complete catalogue of rocking rates under the stars of the Star Garden of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the star-tree rotate to different rates, and in what context are the rotational periods with the planet development."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of his solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades is 445 lightyears away from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">These mature stars repel large amounts of starches to peak rotations.</seg>
<seg id="9">"as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars."</seg>
<seg id="10">"when a star breaks down, its rotation rate begins to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more solid stars revolve more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Rebull compares stars with dancers, with larger stars revolving slower Pirouettes than smaller ones."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massively, whereas quicker rotors tend to be very bright stars," "said Rebull."</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the constellation of the Plejads is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the stellar qualities such as rocking rates."</seg>

<seg id="9">Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Firm of the Year for Insolvency Administration Schneider Geiwitz & Partner Firm of the Year for Tax Gleiss Lutz</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks happened quickly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the victim's computer, it is targeted for unmodified files such as word-, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"after that, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the German companies reported revenue losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operation, in case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, many hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user-occupied areas and contact with the blackposts and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to gain more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, create freely accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate hard and pay five digits to recover their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of potentially high and relatively low risk gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is about three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers resell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the existing malware kits have been created by providing users with malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you logically log in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set by a criminal and mandates another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per infected host.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals occupy spammers with the spread," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known by many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a mini van."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V appears rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well processed and are pleasant, only the cockpit side of the interior falls apart."</seg>
<seg id="7">"more versatile than comparable vehicles, the HR-V is in the storage box."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is not only a trunk of 453 l of high-featured and 1026 l backrests available, but there is the" Magic Seats. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical when it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie armchair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded easily, however the loading height with 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, his work should be somewhat quieter."</seg>

<seg id="19">"the security system is part of the City-emergency braking system (working at speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane support assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because in the maneuvering many obstacles are rated as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent cruise control responds to the signage detection and throttle if necessary the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI connector are available under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, diesel starting from 23,000 Euro."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one rolls around forever, at night it is awake for hours, in the morning it is far from the wake of the wake-ring no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the board of the German Society for Schlaepsy and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an input and sleeping disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medications."</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the insomnia is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awaking is most common in depression," "says Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a disc fraud, can lie poorly, wakes up every two or three hours and possibly starts to salute about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should people with sleep disorders go to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired in the day should go to the doctor's avail.</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment may look quite different: one is tired, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there are hardly any medical practitioners in Germany, accentuated by Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of problems, you should first contact the veterinary surgeon, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise for example snoring with breathing apparatus, in case of sick day-fatigue, in case of dormant or when one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After the disgusting one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal glasses, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera captures the sleeping end at the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers manage the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">"there are quite a lot of adjusting screws, where you can set for a better sleep."</seg>
<seg id="35">"it counts on: regular sleeping and stopping times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleeping, alcohol, and at night don't look at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, some linden trees, meanwhile a rest of cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't look like this at first glance, but the police are among the" "dangerous places" "of the city."</seg>

<seg id="3">"at the facade of a grey house, someone is" ugly! "sprayed."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of a Lidl, which is to be demolished also soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments should be built here until 2017."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article about this" trendy district, "as the responsible estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in the last few weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the house is number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the occupants have lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Insenator Henkel has spoken repeatedly for a tough action by the police against the project, called the area as a" No-Go zone "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were dispelled with 300 police officers, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew carriages on site, shut off parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, the building worker commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved from sympathisers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others converse before late Späti."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main source of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, is mainly generated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a" "Kiez", "who wants to call itself police protection against the most scandalous left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police between house-occupants and their neighbours make up, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the East of Berlin, Friedrichshain was a traditional working-class neighborhood, which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all the Mainzer street near the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga, and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and Berliners from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on raised discs or newly painted facades that were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year so often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: criminal offences, such as bodily injury, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the offences make material damage, which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant near the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is appetizing: the people in 94 are their neighbors, that have not been this."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the famous burning cars, too, don't give it any longer directly in Riga."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the architect, her street is not a criminal background, on the contrary:" here, one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately pulled into the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that's why it was also so important to get back to the residents: by the police, politics and the media, which in July everybody suddenly claims the interpretation of the city."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by exposing new buildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - people living here are rather people who are not so well drunk," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can one do if someone never hears it?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for zooms that annoy themselves about colour bombs: the skin projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">"who is pulling, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub, can badly complain about noise there."</seg>

<seg id="16">New containers at Wasenstraße will soon be available</seg>
<seg id="17">"for some time, a serious problem has been to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the provision of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must bear the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Council Office to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work so far as you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be invalidated, as it is called so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and training activities for refugees and migrants who have to be undamaged or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as told by Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, activity does not only mean a job."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the tag needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, we need offers such as sports, contacts with local people and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, there are also administration and volunteers."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make time wiser, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who eventually develop the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, don't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also problem cases, says Customer honestly," People who do nothing at all. "the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always motivating others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is a" "mammoth task". ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two after the latest events fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer says quite clearly, "what some may call naive." "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would bring them completely in retribution.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main and volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new collision could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics detests itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine Customer, too, makes it clear that the Urbacher is also already busy to integrate the existing people wisely."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently about 100 persons, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
